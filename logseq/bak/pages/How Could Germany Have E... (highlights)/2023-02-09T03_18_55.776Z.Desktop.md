	- How could Germany have embraced the mob-like Nazis?
	  
	  The rise of the far-right, Hannah Arendt explains, was caused by the hypocrisy of the left:
	  
	  Woke Capital.

	- Germany was the spearhead of the enlightenment. For centuries it championed progressive values of reason and compassion.
	  
	  How could Germany and many of its greatest thinkers (Heidegger, Schmitt) have embraced the mob-like values of the Nazis?

	- Hannah Arendt's answer is that Germany wasn't so much pulled towards the mob values of the Nazis but pushed away from the progressive values of the ruling class. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608531933872676865))
	- Before the Nazis, Germany was dominated by the capitalist bourgeoise who paraded their progressive values, not unlike the woke capital of today.
	  
	  These "liberal bourgeoise" as Arendt called them were hypocrites who didn't believe in these values at all. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608531936460541954))
	- The liberal bourgeoise publicly advertised their compassion, tolerance, and concern for victims. Privately, all they cared about was profit, acted like thugs, and even mocked these values. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608531939102961664))
	- This obvious hypocrisy disgusted the German people. It hollowed out the humanistic values and made the Nazi's consistency seem refreshing.
	  
	  If the liberal bourgeoise acted mob-like but claimed they were angels, at least the Nazis acted mob-like and claimed they were the mob. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608531941674057728))
	- So, it wasn't that Germany was attracted to the mob values of the Nazis but that the repulsing hypocrisy of the progressives made openly embracing mob values seem innovative and refreshing in comparison.
	  
	  In Arendt's own words: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608531944282939393))
	- "Since the bourgeoisie claimed to be the guardian of Western traditions and confounded all moral issues by parading publicly virtues which it not only did not possess in private and business life, but actually held in contempt, it seemed revolutionary to admit cruelty ...

	- ... to disregard human values ... those who traditionally hated the bourgeoisie and had voluntarily left respectable society saw [in the Nazis] only the lack of hypocrisy and respectability, not the content of Nazism itself."
	- Let me be clear: the hypocrisy of the left was ONE of many causes which Arendt identified.
	  
	  But it is particularly noteworthy as the force which destroyed humanistic values and legitimized the mob values of the Nazis. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608531957926998016))
	- Philosopher René Girard helps us understand the psychology and danger of  hypocrisy.
	  
	  For Girard, we tend to choose values less out of a reasoned deliberation but based on how we feel about the people associated with those values.

	- If I associate a certain value say, protecting victims, with those whom I admire then I more easily adopt it myself.
	  
	  If I associate it with those whom I loathe, I am pushed towards adopting its opposite (persecuting victims). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608531968979001344))
	- People feel repulsed by hypocrites. So, whatever values hypocrites champion will lose respectability.
	  
	  Hypocritical progressives are more dangerous to progressivism than reactionaries.
	  
	  Licentious Catholic clergy are more responsible for the fall of Christianity than atheists. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608531971642359808))
	- What's terrifying is that the liberal bourgeoise of the Weimar republic have returned as the Woke Capital of today.
	  
	  We are again faced with a ruling class who champion high-flown progressive ideals which they privately loathe and hypocritically transgress. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608531974335102977))
	- Woke corporations don't care about the values they profess to champion. They are "allies" only where it is profitable to be so.

	- There are entire intellectual movements catered to woke capital. Effective altruism is chief amongst them. It is the perfect ideological vessel for the liberal bourgeoise: an altruistic excuse to acquire as much power as possible.

	- Here's the banner boy of effective altruism @SBF_FTX admitting that his progressive values were just a tool in this "dumb game we woke westerners play where we say all the right shiboleths and so everyone likes us."

	- Let me be clear: it's not dangerous for companies to seek profit, that's capitalism. It's also not dangerous for companies to advance a noble goal, there are effective mission-driven orgs.
	  
	  It's dangerous when primarily profit-driven orgs pretend they have a noble goal. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608531999559680001))
	- We would do well in learning the lesson that Arendt is trying to teach us: the hypocrisy of the left is a chief cause in the radicalization of the right. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608532002231443456))
