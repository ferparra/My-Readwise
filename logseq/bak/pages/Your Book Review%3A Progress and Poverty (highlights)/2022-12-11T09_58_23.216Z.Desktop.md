	- Industrialization should have freed humankind from drudgery and want. And yet George instead sees:
	  
	  > complaints of industrial depression; of labor condemned to involuntary idleness; of capital massed and wasting; of pecuniary distress among business men; of want and suffering and anxiety among the working class ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm0836y8hbp19pk265gt4p8v))
	- resilience of poverty, oppression, and inequality in the face of advancing economic development is not some embarrassing accident we'll eventually get around to fixing, it's an inescapable consequence of our socioeconomic system.

	- By George, what is wealth?
	  
	  Wealth is produced when **Nature's bounty** is touched by **human labor** resulting in a **tangible product** that is the object of **human desire.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm086n5w4snz7atp49ws227m))
	- George goes the other way:
	  
	  > It is never the amount of labor that has been exerted in bringing a thing into being that determines its value, but always the amount of labor that will be rendered in exchange for it.  
	  >   
	  > - Henry George, *The Science of Political Economy,* p. 253
	  
	  In other words, "a thing's value is whatever someone is willing to pay for it." This is in line with the so-called [marginal revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility#Marginal_Revolution) (the movement, not the [blog](https://marginalrevolution.com/)) and modern theories of value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm087xyytxa0wkz1mqw12850))
	- **Labor**
	  
	  Labor is the exertion of human beings. It's possible to labor to no avail (try punching a concrete wall), but typically humans labor towards an end, such as gaining wealth. But whether or not we accomplish anything with our efforts, George calls them labor. Labor isn't just making things, by the way – it's also moving or exchanging them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm088sswk79sjn0m22ab4mkg))
	- **Production**
	  
	  Production is labor applied "to the production *of wealth."* You know, *productively*. This is all human exertion that isn't punching a concrete wall and rewards you for your efforts with something that fits the definition of wealth. Said wealth is the "product of labor." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm0894615xkg8h7cr1ak887f))
	- Likewise **Stocks and Bonds** and other financial instruments are not wealth. These are also just claims on wealth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm08acfdxkh84w985sdaams9))
	- By George, all capital is wealth, but not all wealth is capital. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm08bw346rae9snfvk7d2mpn))
	- **Land, land, land.**
	  
	  By George, land is not wealth.
	  
	  And it's *definitely* not capital. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm08cjj33f7efq0hh6dsz80d))

	- Why, in spite of increase in productive power, do wages tend to a minimum which will give but a bare living? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm08f3ca6sf8pgwanhdxb7m6))
	- **wages**, instead of being drawn from **capital**, are in reality drawn from the **product of the labor** for which they are paid. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm08fz12y821xgkwsebj7580))
	- Capital "increases the power of labor to produce wealth."
	  
	  How?
	  
	  •   By enabling labor to apply itself more effectively (power tools go brrrr)
	    
	  •   By availing labor of the reproductive forces of nature (cows make baby cows)
	    
	  •   By making possible the division & specialization of labor (you dig bait, I'll catch fish) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm08haqqk0h62bg5w777ns66))
	- **Land** is"all natural opportunities or forces" and its return is **rent**  
	  **Labor** is "all human exertion" and its return is **wages**  
	  **Capital** is"all wealth used to produce more wealth" and its return is **interest** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm08k4bj6bk80851fct2a2eg))
	- Deadweight Loss is the lost economic activity or value caused by some policy. It's often summarized by the phrase "If you want less of something, tax it." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm08sm3km9yne1asjpa7hfdz))
	- ![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e01d1dd-61fa-4c1b-8f90-6669f2c20d81_632x632.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm08sbgdf4sh2zr5jf64dsjh))

	- So to sum up, if we tax the ever loving hell out of ground rent, George says we'll see the following benefits:
	  
	  •   Make housing much more affordable
	    
	  •   Eliminate perverse incentives and speculation
	    
	  •   Encourage the most efficient use of land
	    
	  •   End wage slavery and rack-rents
	    
	  •   Encourage investment and innovation
	    
	  •   Fund a Universal Basic Income and public goods
	    
	  •   Lower or eliminate some other unpopular taxes
	    
	  •   Not hand everything over to a centralized planned economy that probably won't work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm08vgs83tnqnz2g3y6v0ka4))
	- Government redistribution of wealth through high taxes (presumably income or wealth) have two well known problems. First, you massively increase the size and scope of government, inviting corruption, an invasive surveillance state, and power-hungry politicians. Second, by taxing income or wealth you're also taxing production, creating "Deadweight loss." Also, given labor and capital can move, if you try to tax them more than they like they will just go somewhere else (note that land alone *cannot* do this).
