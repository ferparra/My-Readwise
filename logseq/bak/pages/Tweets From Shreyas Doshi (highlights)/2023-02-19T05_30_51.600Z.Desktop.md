	- @Suhail Stripe did not have people with the Product Manager title for several years.
	  
	  First person with the PM title was hired in 2015 (5 years after founding).
	  
	  But.... there were people that were performing the PM role before that and were clearly doing that quite well.

	- To be consistently effective in Product Management, you need to build expertise in 5 domains.
	  
	  Tactics & Processes are essential for starting.
	  
	  But don't stop there.
	  
	  Important to learn, build & teach the right Principles, Frameworks & Mindset.
	  
	  Mindset is especially underrated.

	- Placebo Productivity: when we do tasks that make us feel productive but we are in fact doing them to avoid doing more productive tasks that are hard.
	  
	  Placebo Productivity is actually a useful hack when we are low on willpower. So use it. But don‚Äôt fill your entire day with it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1413182440533860354))
	- The Lindy Effect, for product roadmaps:
	  
	  The longer a feature has been on the product roadmap, the longer it‚Äôll tend to remain on the roadmap. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1285819968039223296))
	- Things that are easy to say but very hard in practice as a leader
	  
	  1) Your job is to repeat, repeat, repeat
	  
	  2) Disagreement from your team is a feature not a bug
	  
	  3) Not everyone has the same goals & ambitions as you
	  
	  4) Take time to find the right hire. Bear the pain until then ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1420592233372209154))
	- Many product people are highly stressed.
	  
	  Often the stress doesn‚Äôt actually come from difficult situations. It comes from our internal resistance to those situations.
	  
	  So hearing from a trusted mentor that ‚ÄúThis is normal‚Äù can be surprisingly soothing for capable product people. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1423323313208578051))
	- Useful as Guidelines, Harmful as Dogma:
	  
	  1) Just ship the MVP & iterate
	  
	  2) Never miss the launch date
	  
	  3) Justify every feature with data
	  
	  4) Hit OKRs at all costs
	  
	  5) Tackle low hanging fruit first
	  
	  6) Always prioritize what users want
	  
	  7) Feature parity before differentiation ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1318073178686566400))

	- People assume that Product Creativity just requires Insight
	  
	  In reality:

	- Key definitions:
	  
	  Strategy is about the choices you make to differentiate & distribute your product to create long-term competitive advantage, and tying these choices to a cohesive action plan.

	- A surprisingly large part of a person‚Äôs leadership style is determined simply by the story they have told themselves about what sort of activities are productive vs. unproductive. Being adaptive is therefore nearly impossible for many, because they never change that story. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1593795541720133635))

	- The biggest problem with saying that Execution is more important than Ideas is that it demonstrates a gross misunderstanding of how you get outstanding Execution: you get it through 100s of excellent (and usually correct) Ideas about what to do & how to do it, day in and day out.
