- [[50 Short Product Lessons (highlights)]]
	- **[[Stakeholder management]]**
	  collapsed:: true
	  Successful teams prioritise coherent storytelling and flexible communication artefacts. They generate multiple solutions and are honest about uncertainty. Additionally, they **clearly define a [[product strategy]]**, possess **strong [[leadership]]**, and employ **[[problem-solving]] teams**.
		- **Storytelling, Repeated Stories**
		  collapsed:: true
		      Successful teams create **coherent stories** about their work, sharing them **transparently** and **in depth** to develop a deeper understanding of the team's progress, strategy, and the bets they're making.
			- The Importance of Coherent [[Storytelling]] in Successful Teams
				- Successful teams create coherent stories about their work, providing context and depth to their decisions and strategies.
				- Experienced team members explain how current projects fit into the broader company strategy, taking into account major market forces, uncertainties, and unique advantages.
				- Detailed, meaningful stories about the team's work, discussing assumptions, expectations, surprises, and lessons learned, using both qualitative and quantitative data, are key features of successful teams.
			- The Need for In-Depth Reflection and Dialogue
				- Sharing stories internally in an honest, transparent, and in-depth manner helps the team understand their missions, challenges, and lessons learned.
				- This level of reflection goes beyond simple dashboards and brief mentions of successes at quarterly meetings, offering a deeper understanding of the team's progress and strategy.
				- Dialogue about the "game" the team is playing, the bets they're making, and their learning experiences is a crucial, yet often neglected, capability.
			- The Challenge of Allocating Time for [[Storytelling]] and [[Reflection]]
				- Many product managers view activities like writing about their work as extracurricular, with the bulk of their time dedicated to current or future projects.
				- To build storytelling and reflection skills, it's necessary to carve out specific time for these activities, helping the team understand how their work fits into the bigger picture and what they've learned.
		- **One Pagers**
		  collapsed:: true
		      One-pager formats can be restrictive, so teams should use **flexible artefacts** that can evolve over time and **provide necessary information** to all members.
			- Limitations of One-Pager Formats
				- Although one-pager formats are widely used in companies to communicate project ideas or "bets", they can be restrictive and might not accommodate all types of ideas.
				- Different team members may require different types of information to make decisions, which may not fit neatly into a single document format.
			- Use of Checklists
				- Using a checklist as a reminder, instead of a strict requirement, can provide flexibility and accommodate the nuances of different projects.
			- Approach for Opportunity-Based Bets
				- For opportunity-based bets, teams should avoid pre-determining the solution. Instead, the opportunity should be proposed and a series of pivot-or-proceed points should be established.
			- Flexibility of Formats for Communicating Bets
				- The formats used to communicate bets, such as one-pagers, should be flexible enough to accommodate different types of bets, provide necessary information, and avoid omitting important details.
			- Dealing with Realities and First Principles
				- Teams are encouraged to deal with the reality in the room by thinking about first principles and treating these documents as living artefacts that can evolve over time.
			- Ultimate Goal of Communication Artefacts
				- The ultimate goal is to ensure that the artefacts used for communication are flexible, accommodating, and provide the necessary information to all team members.
		- **Bring me solutions (not problems) and My Idea-ism**
		  collapsed:: true
		      Presenting multiple solutions and focusing on finding the best overall solution, rather than promoting personal ideas, can lead to more successful problem-solving and careers in Product.
			- Pressure to Present Solutions, Not Problems
				- Many work cultures encourage employees to bring solutions instead of problems, which can limit innovation in product development.
				- This pressure can inhibit sufficient space for reflection and the openness required for creative problem-solving.
			- Reframing Problems as Opportunities
				- Shifting focus from problems to opportunities can stimulate more innovative thinking and solutions.
				- Framing issues as opportunities can help teams get excited about the prospects and potential benefits.
			- Offering Multiple Solutions
				- Instead of presenting a single solution, bringing several potential solutions can avoid locking the team into a specific path.
				- Offering various options allows for more flexible and comprehensive problem-solving.
			- The Impact of Team Track Record
				- Teams with a successful track record for problem-solving are often given more flexibility to explore broad opportunities.
				- Conversely, teams without a strong track record may face more pressure and less flexibility in their approach.
			- Overcoming Individualism in Solution Generation
				- Despite cultural emphasis on individual achievement, it is crucial to focus on finding the best overall solution, rather than promoting personal ideas.
				- In the long run, those who inspire a variety of effective solutions and foster leverage within their organisations tend to have more successful careers.
		- **Credibility by not manufacturing certainty with your team**
		  collapsed:: true
		      Product managers can maintain team credibility by embracing and communicating uncertainties effectively, being honest about the unknowns, using strategies to convey degrees of uncertainty, prioritising learning to navigate through the uncertainties, and fostering a culture of discovery to improve team readiness and comfort.
			- Loss of Team Credibility
				- Product managers often lose credibility when they try to manufacture certainty to convince the team to follow their plans.
				- This approach can create distrust or fatigue within the team, causing team members to work around the product manager.
			- Openness About Uncertainty
				- Building credibility involves being clear about what is certain and what is not.
				- Communicating honestly about the "unknown unknowns" can foster trust with problem-solving team members.
			- Communicating Degrees of Uncertainty
				- Conveying degrees of uncertainty can be challenging, as people may struggle to think probabilistically.
				- Tools like "tallying up odds" or comparing the situation to betting personal money can help communicate uncertainty effectively.
			- Admitting and Accepting Uncertainty
				- In presentations or kick-offs, it's important to be clear about what is currently unknown and what uncertainties you're comfortable with.
				- Framing an issue with an understanding of its inherent uncertainty, rather than pretending to be certain, can be powerful.
			- Prioritising Learning and Discovery
				- Identify what the team needs to learn about a particular effort.
				- Prioritise a "learning backlog" to help the team understand what they need to figure out before moving forward.
				- Be explicit about the learning efforts being undertaken to improve team comfort and readiness.
		- **Don’t outsource [[Product Strategy]]**
		      A successful product strategy requires strong leadership, alignment across departments, **viewing product teams as problem solvers**, maintaining consistency in strategy, and incorporating product understanding into sales, as this enables strategic conversations with customers and a shared vision within the organisation.
	- **[[Product Strategy]]**
	  collapsed:: true
	  Successful Product teams require prioritising opportunities over problems, adapting to different types of bets and tasks, transparently presenting a model of product value creation, and maintaining a customer-focused approach across all aspects of the business.
		- **Opportunities vs. Interventions**
		      Product development often involves nested problems and solutions, but not every existing problem holds value in its solution, so organisations should prioritise opportunities over problems to capture additional value and encourage broader and more strategic thinking.
			- Nested Problems and Solutions
				- Problems in product development often represent nested solutions to higher-level problems.
				- For example, generating revenue is both a problem and a solution to the company's mission.
			- Ownership of Problems and Solutions
				- Organizations often struggle with defining who owns problems and solutions.
				- This debate involves how tasks are decomposed and interconnected within the organisation.
			- Opportunities and Interventions
				- An intervention implies a temporary change in behaviour that may not always be beneficial.
				- This concept helps relieve the pressure of delivering permanent, perfect features.
			- Problem Existence vs. Value in Solution
				- Not every existing problem holds value in its solution.
				- This is highlighted when problems are reframed as opportunities, which are not binary and can be incrementally explored.
			- Prioritising Opportunities Over Problems
				- Prioritising opportunities to capture additional value feels different than prioritising problems to solve.
				- This perspective encourages broader and more strategic thinking, helping teams to focus more on impact.
		- **Mission vs. Projects**
		      Understanding the difference between a project and a product, framing missions as bets or opportunities, and embracing stopping functions are crucial for establishing a sense of purpose and success in product development.
			- Product Thinking vs. Project Thinking
				- It is crucial to understand the difference between a project and a product.
				- A product can be seen as the result of a series of completed projects.
			- Missions or Initiatives vs. Projects
				- Missions or initiatives differ from projects in that they can be open-ended and aren't necessarily tied to a specific delivery.
				- The longer you spend on a mission, the more its value and success are suggested.
			- Framing Missions as Bets
				- Missions aren't constrained by the factory metaphor of simply delivering products.
				- Instead, they should be framed as bets or opportunities for learning and providing value.
			- Nested Missions
				- Missions can range from small, few-days-long tasks to larger, months or years-long initiatives.
				- The company is based on a series of these nested missions, bets, and beliefs.
			- Stopping Functions in Missions
				- Missions may have a stopping function, an agreed-upon point at which the team may decide to cease pursuing the mission.
				- This is different from a predetermined definition of "done" or delivery.
			- The Power of Reframing
				- Reframing predetermined outcomes as initiatives to improve lives, metrics, or market penetration can be extremely powerful.
				- It can prevent the feeling of endless iteration and provide a sense of purpose.
		- **Bets**
		      Different types of bets help frame a company's investments and product development, and an adaptive approach is necessary to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach, considering the interrelatedness of a company's bets.
			- Types and Nature of Bets
				- Bets in a business context vary in size, risk level, and duration.
				- A company may have multiple bets developing in parallel, all of which are interlinked and related in some way.
			- Benefits of Thinking in Terms of Bets
				- Thinking in terms of bets helps to identify different types and shapes of investments a company makes, and how they are related to product development.
				- Some bets, especially those at the core of a startup's ideas, take a long time to mature. Communicating these bets clearly can help new team members understand the company's direction and assumptions.
			- Strategies for Placing Bets
				- The concept of bets highlights that there are often better ways to place them, which may involve more incremental rather than big-batch bets, depending on the environment.
			- Importance of an Adaptive Approach
				- Considering the different types of bets helps to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach to the work a company is doing, as there are numerous variations that require an adaptive approach.
			- Interrelatedness of Bets
				- The interrelatedness of a company's bets is crucial, as core beliefs can filter up into the work currently happening, and bets across different time frames can impact the work being done right now.
				- Bets in a business context come in different sizes, risk levels, and durations.
				- A company may have a portfolio of bets developing in parallel, all of which are interlinked and related in some way.
		- **Multiple Operating Models at Once**
		      Teams should avoid expecting one process to apply to all types of bets and instead maintain a stable set of patterns for approaching work while accommodating the unique nature of different tasks.
			- Types of Bets
				- Teams often have various types of bets or projects in progress simultaneously.
				- It's an anti-pattern to expect one process to apply to all types of bets, as each bet may require a different approach.
			- Approach of High-Performing Teams
				- High-performing teams maintain a stable set of patterns for how they approach their work, while also accommodating the unique nature of different tasks.
				- The approach to small customer feature requests would differ from more exploratory efforts.
			- Running Concurrent Operating Models
				- While it may be tempting to isolate teams working on different types of projects, it can be demoralising and limit cross-functional interaction.
				- Operating different models concurrently requires nuanced handling and effort to get right.
			- Agile Approach and Its Limitations
				- While many teams take an agile approach, treating all tasks as emergent, some problems, especially architectural ones, need more careful consideration.
			- Different Skills for Different Bets
				- Different product managers might excel at handling different types of bets based on their skills.
				- For example, some might be good at handling a large number of partners, others at incremental improvements, and others at ideation and early validation.
			- Staffing and Strategy Models
				- The staffing and skill sets should align with the nature of the bets being made.
				- One model to consider is to identify areas where the team is playing offense, defense, and diversifying.
		- **The Attraction of Short-term Thinking**
		      Companies struggle to balance short-term demands with long-term outcomes, and experienced leaders can resist chasing short-term outcomes, while teams that recognise potential problems early can mitigate negative side-effects by course-correcting quickly.
			- Balancing Short-term and Long-term Goals
				- All companies struggle to balance short-term demands with mid and long-term outcomes. This challenge is similar to the ones we face in our personal lives, where we often get sidetracked by short-term objectives.
			- Solutions to this Dilemma
				- Stubbornness: Experienced leaders often develop a level of stubbornness that allows them to resist chasing short-term outcomes and instead focus on building long-term company resilience.
				- Compressing Durations: Teams that become better at recognising early indicators of potential problems can course-correct more quickly, mitigating the negative side-effects of short-term gains.
			- Examples of these Solutions
				- Netflix founder Reed Hastings applied his experiences from previous companies to build a strong, long-term-focused company culture.
				- **Teams that are effective at raising red flags about issues like accumulating technical debt or developing dependencies can help prevent chronic issues from developing.**
		- **Strategy and its Relation to Beliefs**
		      This selection discusses strategy in agile environments, the importance of strategic positioning and understanding product market fit, and the potential for companies to lose sight of their identity and beliefs.
			- Negative Connotations of Strategy
				- In agile or iterative environments, strategy is often viewed negatively due to its assumptions, scale, and static nature.
				- Some product teams feel restricted by strategy, as it can dictate future decisions about markets, personas, and competitors.
			- Overemphasis on Product Quality
				- Focusing exclusively on solving a human need with a good product is a great principle but can lead to teams overlooking market dynamics.
				- Even products with strong design culture can suffer if they aren't paying attention to market shifts and broader industry trends.
			- Importance of Strategic Positioning
				- Teams need to understand "which wave they are riding" in terms of industry trends and disruptive forces.
				- Fundamental strategic bets have a great influence on a team's approach to measurement and can impact overall business operations.
			- Necessity of Understanding Product Market Fit
				- Teams can get distracted by sub-stages of finding product-market fit and lose sight of their overarching goal.
				- It's crucial to map out core beliefs about industry movement and understand the company's position relative to competitors, potential disruptors, and legacy solutions.
			- Strategy and Company Identity
				- Understanding strategy can lead to revelations about a company's true nature (e.g., realizing a company is a data company, not a banking company).
				- A company's beliefs and identity directly influence their strategy.
		- **Functional Feature Factories**
		      Companies can be categorised into three types based on feature development: those struggling with producing usable features, those functioning as feature factories with moderate impact, and those excelling in decision quality and velocity by effectively balancing product complexity and customer outcomes.
			- Three categories of companies based on feature development:
				- Companies that struggle to get things done:
					- Often chase silver bullets.
					- Lack of usability in released features.
					- Struggle with producing functional products.
				- Functional feature factories:
					- Release usable features that customers appreciate.
					- Lack serious focus on improving the product significantly.
					- Tend to have an impact level of 4 to 7 out of 10.
					- Rarely introduce changes that drastically improve the product or customer experience.
					- Eventually, struggle with the complexity of their product due to too many promises made to customers.
				- Companies that excel in decision quality and velocity:
					- Manage to limit the complexity they add to their product relative to the outcomes they create for customers.
					- Capable of pivoting, learning, and leveraging that learning to introduce step changes in their product.
					- Have a disciplined, systematic approach to product development.
					- Might start with duds but evolve and achieve knockout wins.
			- Important considerations:
				- Most long-surviving companies avoid terrible decisions, but many fall into the trap of over-complicating their product.
				- High-performing companies often have only a small percentage of decisions turn out to be knockout wins, illustrating the risk of adding complexity without creating value.
				- Companies need to balance the complexity they add with the value created for customers.
		- **Modelling the Business**
		      To succeed in product management, it is crucial to comprehend growth models and product-specific strategies, connect business frameworks with product strategies, articulate the value proposition and product strategy, utilise onboarding and product usage to unlock value, and present a clear mental model for how the product generates value.
			- Understanding growth models and product-specific strategies
				- Many startup teams understand high-level growth models but fail to incorporate their own product's specifics.
				- Teams often track standard ratios like customer acquisition cost to lifetime value but don't analyse how their product contributes to these metrics.
			- Bridging business frameworks and product strategies
				- There's a need for a link between high-level business frameworks and specific product strategies.
				- Teams must have a clear hypothesis on how their strategy will increase the lifetime value of customers.
			- Articulating the value proposition and product strategy
				- Example: A B2B product disrupting a legacy solution may focus on usability and accommodating diverse customer types.
				- Teams often struggle to articulate their unique mental model of value creation for their product.
			- Using onboarding and product usage to unlock value
				- Many teams operate on the assumption of a "magic moment" in the product that will unlock its value for users.
			- Presenting a transparent mental model
				- Teams should transparently present a model of how the product creates value, using both quantitative and qualitative elements.
				- The challenge is to represent current beliefs accurately in this model of product value creation.
		- **Not Dividing Out “Customer-facing” and “Non-customer Facing”**
		      All aspects of a business, including operations and backend work, impact the customer experience, and therefore should be considered customer-facing, with product managers playing a crucial role in identifying and resolving issues that can significantly hamper value creation and slow down the overall workflow.
			- Problem with categorising work as "non-customer-facing"
				- All aspects of a business, including operational and backend work, impact customers.
				- Issues such as slow product development and quality problems directly affect the customer experience.
			- Importance of recognising all work as customer-facing
				- If a company is slowed down due to organisational issues, this impacts customers more than any specific feature might.
				- The optics of releasing new things can't mask underlying issues that customers will eventually feel.
			- Connection between internal operations and customer outcomes
				- Operational issues can hinder the deployment of new features and products, causing quality issues and delays.
				- Even if these issues seem unrelated to the product, they impact the ability to get clean data and maintain quality control.
				- Infrastructure and tooling issues can prevent the implementation of efficient practices like small batches and frequent integration.
			- Impact on the organisation
				- Organizational blockers lead to a progressive deceleration in the ability to generate outcomes.
				- This can trigger more "success theater" and blame within the organisation, creating an unhealthy work environment.
			- Role of the product manager in addressing these issues
				- Product managers can assist teams that usually don't have such a role, helping them to form business cases around their work.
				- If an issue is sapping a significant percentage of capacity for value creation, resolving that issue becomes the single most valuable thing a product manager can do.
				- Addressing these issues can significantly speed up the overall workflow in the long run.
		- **Products and features are temporary**
		      In the ever-evolving SaaS industry, products and features are temporary delivery mechanisms that continuously adapt to meet human needs, and **organising teams around value streams**, rather than specific functions, fosters a deeper and more persistent understanding of these needs, enabling effective product development and service delivery.
			- The Temporary Nature of SaaS Products and Features
				- SaaS products and their features are temporary mechanisms to meet human needs and provide value.
				- Companies are constantly evolving and disrupting their methods of delivering value.
			- Evolution, Not Perfection, in Product Development
				- The concept of an unchanging, perfect product does not align with the dynamic nature of software products.
				- A company's deep understanding of customer needs persists through technology shifts and product evolution.
			- Team Organization and its Impact on Understanding Customer Needs
				- Dividing teams by function can lead to a disjointed understanding of the customer and the product's value.
				- Adopting a value stream-oriented team structure helps connect people with persistent human needs, thus improving product development and service delivery.
		- **Shifts that necessitate all of this**
		      Product management and development are evolving in response to factors like teams becoming the business, gaining direct access to insights and users, increasing independence, rising importance of user experience, shift to subscription models, changing workplace expectations, and increasingly complex product touch points.
			- Shift in Business-Team Dichotomy
				- Teams are increasingly seen as the business itself, not separate entities.
				- Teams have direct access to users and stakeholders.
				- Less need for customer or user proxies.
			- Access to Insights and Data
				- Teams can make quicker decisions due to direct access to insights.
				- Faster feedback mechanisms due to rise of devops.
				- Shift from a "ship and forget" mentality.
			- Growing Independence of Teams
				- Teams can independently ship and deploy into production.
				- Cloud infrastructure and services have lowered barriers to shipping.
			- Rising Importance of User Experience
				- User experience is seen as a key differentiator.
				- Business-to-consumer mobile driving better user experiences.
			- Shift to Subscription Models
				- Customers expect constant enhancements and improvements.
				- Changes the dynamics around new product introductions.
			- Changing Workplace Expectations
				- Expectations around team autonomy and flexibility are shifting.
				- Increased expectations around organizational transparency.
			- Increasingly Complex Product Touchpoints
				- Products span many teams with different specializations.
				- The whole company becomes the product in service ecosystems.
				- Trend towards more complexity in customer interactions.
		- **Perspectives on roadmapping**
		      Roadmapping approaches are evolving from traditional swim lane paradigms to more flexible and autonomous strategies, such as user story maps and Kanban boards, with a focus on prioritised problem or opportunity statements rather than detailed features, potentially supplemented by other artefacts to illustrate the overall mental model of the problem being addressed.
	- **[[Prioritisation]]**
	  collapsed:: true
	  To succeed in product prioritisation, teams must hold off decision-making and explore all potential opportunities. They should focus on **large, valuable opportunities and small, high-value tasks**. Avoid oversimplifying by only considering effort and value, making early commitments to specific solutions, or getting caught up in medium-value tasks. Encourage the use of flexible models that consider various factors, rather than rigid, complicated schemes.
		- **Danger of Premature Convergence**
		      Premature convergence is the rush to find a solution or decision too early in a process, often due to discomfort with uncertainty, which may lead to solving the wrong problem, missing creative solutions, and reinforcing biases, thus the ideal time to converge is usually later than initially comfortable, signalled by a period of messiness and slight discomfort.
			- **Premature Convergence**
				- Definition: Converging on a solution or decision earlier than optimal due to discomfort with uncertainty.
				- Causes:
					- Desire for specific plans and certainty.
					- Pressure to keep the team busy and have the next task ready.
				- Consequences:
					- Hidden costs as the benefits of delaying decision-making are often not visible.
					- Increased risk of solving the wrong problem.
					- Missed opportunities for diverse perspectives and creative problem solving.
					- Reinforcement of confirmation bias and sunk cost bias.
			- **Ideal Time to Converge**
				- Generally, the optimal time is "a little later than is comfortable."
				- Indicators:
					- A period of messiness and discomfort indicates that convergence is happening at the right time.
					- Initial sense of certainty and early momentum followed by hiccups indicate early convergence.
				- Resistance to premature convergence:
					- Resist the urge to plan upstream when things are moving slowly.
					- Aim to plan at the "last responsible moment" rather than planning prematurely out of nervousness.
		- **Prioritising Opportunities**
		      Prioritisation should be based on the **size of the opportunity** rather than a simplistic measure of value and effort, enabling teams to innovate, take risks, and effectively tackle significant opportunities without prematurely committing to specific solutions.
			- Common Prioritisation Misconception
				- Teams often prioritise based on value and effort, which is an oversimplified approach.
				- It neglects factors like experimentation, confidence, and risk which are critical in making informed decisions.
				- This method does not account for the vast differences in value and effort among different tasks.
			- Optimal Prioritisation Approach
				- Prioritise based on the size of the opportunity instead of focusing on smaller tasks with low effort.
				- Refrain from committing to a particular solution or intervention prematurely, allow teams to analyse the opportunity first.
				- It's crucial not to lose sight of the significant opportunity while tackling smaller tasks.
			- Effect on Shared Teams
				- If shared teams, such as infrastructure teams, are forced to decide on tasks prematurely, it can lead to suboptimal results.
				- Prioritising by opportunity size allows shared teams to be more creative and effective in their approach.
		- **Two Priority Levels**
		      Prioritisation should focus on tackling extremely valuable, experimentation-friendly opportunities and small tasks with reasonable to high value, while avoiding the trap of medium-value tasks that could cause teams to miss out on significant opportunities.
			- Two Extreme Priority Levels of Work
				- Extremely valuable opportunities that are experimentation-friendly
					- Enables innovation and learning
					- Often avoided due to perceived difficulty and uncertainty
					- Teams often persuade themselves they can't tackle these opportunities due to past failures or the complexity involved
				- Small tasks with reasonable to high value
					- Often include UX tweaks or other small-scale modifications
					- Cumulatively, can have a significant impact on the product
					- Do not present the same risk or difficulty as tackling larger, complex problems
			- The Issue with Medium Value Tasks
				- Teams often talk themselves into pursuing tasks of medium value because they seem manageable and offer some value
				- This approach often results in missing out on high-value opportunities that require more effort and experimentation
				- Leads to a pattern of avoiding challenging yet potentially highly rewarding tasks
			- The Challenge for Teams
				- Consider whether they are avoiding the biggest opportunities due to uncertainty about the solution
				- Analyze if there's a stream of guaranteed small tasks that could cumulatively have a high impact on the product
				- Avoid getting stuck in the "middle ground" of medium-value, medium-effort tasks.
		- **Prioritisation spreadsheets**
		      Complex prioritisation schemes can discourage flexibility and inclusion of new factors, whereas an open model that encourages iteration and forecasting, such as using the cost of delay, can foster a more nuanced understanding of value and its impact on strategy.
	- **[[People]]**
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Starting Together**
		      "Starting together" is a concept that involves initiating a project with all team members simultaneously to minimise planning inventory, encourage collective problem-solving, and foster alignment and understanding of the problem from the onset.
			- **Concept of Starting Together**
				- The idea is to limit planning inventory and involve all team members in the effort.
				- This approach minimises premature convergence and encourages collective problem-solving.
			- **Common Misinterpretations**
				- The concept does not discourage all planning, but rather the practice of a small number of people making decisions for the entire team.
				- The goal is to have the whole team experience the problem together for the first time.
			- **Practical Implementation**
				- Plan a sequence and construct teams in a way that allows for joint initiation of a project.
				- Implement activities such as customer interviews, joint research activities, data presentations, customer visits, and rapid prototyping.
			- **Benefits**
				- Fosters alignment and collective understanding of the problem.
				- Encourages creative and diverse solutions due to collective brainstorming.
				- Common team struggles, especially in terms of getting things done, can often be traced back to the kickoff.
				- Creates a powerful sense of team alignment when everyone experiences the problem at the same time.
		- **Chronic vs. Acute Issues**
		      Successful companies, despite facing similar issues as others, distinguish themselves through their ability to self-repair and solve chronic problems, with the approach to achieve this varying greatly depending on their unique company culture.
			- The facade of perfection and the reality
				- People often assume successful companies don't face problems.
				- Reality is, they also face acute issues but are good at resolving them.
				- They have fewer chronic issues due to their ability to self-repair.
			- Self-repairing nature of successful companies
				- Companies that excel have a kind of immune system that helps them bounce back from issues.
				- They have a knack for resolving issues that are limiting their progress.
				- Employees in these companies acknowledge the existence of problems but also appreciate the company's ability to work them out.
			- Comparison with companies facing chronic issues
				- Some companies struggle with long-standing problems, such as toxic work culture, unresolved issues from mergers and acquisitions, etc.
				- These chronic issues often hinder their progress and ability to self-repair.
			- Diversity in company culture
				- The way companies achieve self-repair can vary greatly depending on their culture.
				- Some are hierarchical with isolated teams, others are flat and extremely transparent.
				- The net effect of successfully dealing with chronic issues is the same, regardless of their different approaches.
				- The variety in approaches is based on the unique culture of each company.
			- Importance of understanding unique approaches
				- Effective problem-solving can come from different levels: management, front line, or a strong CEO.
				- It's crucial not to assume all successful companies are healthy for the same reasons.
				- Digging deeper reveals the unique mechanisms that individual cultures have developed to facilitate information flow and resolve chronic issues.
		- **The Time it Takes to Get Good**
		      Mastering new processes and techniques in an organisation requires time, repetition, a safe environment to fail and learn from mistakes, and the understanding that learning is an ongoing process, not an immediate result of adopting a new framework.
			- The necessity of practice and time
				- Companies often expect immediate results from new processes or techniques, which is unrealistic.
				- Full onboarding and skill development can take up to 12 to 18 months.
				- Repetition and the experience of handling multiple problems are crucial for learning.
				- The ability to fail and learn from mistakes is an important part of growth.
			- The importance of safety in learning
				- Teams should be allowed to make mistakes and learn from them.
				- An environment of safety enables open discussions about experiences and learnings.
			- The limitation of just adopting frameworks
				- Product development involves nuance and varied work, not simply mastering a framework.
				- Success involves recognizing and adapting to various patterns, requiring practice and repetition.
			- The necessity of long-term perspective
				- Some learnings take a long time to fully materialize.
				- While daily learning is important, understanding the big picture can take months or even years.
			- The need for supportive environments
				- Environments that allow for open discussion about failures enable better decision-making.
				- Experienced professionals also need practice when shifting domains or moving to a new setting.
		- **Learned Helplessness**
		      Successful product development requires fostering a culture that encourages problem exploration, breaking away from unproductive patterns, and ensuring open communication among diverse teams, while avoiding overly prescriptive management that could lead to learned helplessness.
			- The range of attitudes towards problem exploration:
				- Some professionals prefer to focus on their primary tasks and responsibilities.
				- Others may have lost faith in the problem-solving process due to prior negative experiences.
				- In environments with low psychological safety, individuals may avoid involvement out of fear of repercussions.
			- Consequences of overly prescriptive management:
				- Team members may adapt and optimise around the manager's prescriptive behaviour, thereby stifling their own initiative.
				- This can lead to learned helplessness, where the team adapts to an unproductive pattern and struggles to break away from it.
			- The challenge of breaking established patterns:
				- Patterns can become ingrained in the culture, making it difficult to change.
				- Professional culture clash and lack of communication among diverse groups can cause resistance to change.
				- It's crucial to be mindful of the patterns being established within a company as they can be hard to unwind later.
		- **Teams Closer to Customers**
		      Connecting teams directly with customers, minimising proxies, and using both data and personal interactions can significantly enhance product development by providing rich insights and mitigating bias.
			- Importance of connecting with customers:
				- Wide spectrum of response times to connect with a user, from immediate to months.
				- The aim is to connect with the right users that match the research criteria.
				- In some cases, teams face many barriers to access the customer directly.
			- The role of data and direct interaction:
				- While data is essential, direct connection with customers provides the context and reasoning behind the data.
				- There is a potential for bias when problems are interpreted and presented by intermediaries.
				- Even companies with rich data may struggle to understand the 'why' behind user behavior.
			- Bringing customers closer to the team:
				- The goal is not just to bring the problem to the team but the person with the problem.
				- The number of proxies between the problem solvers and the customers should be minimized.
				- Stereotypes about certain team members, like engineers, not wanting to interact with users are often incorrect.
				- Direct interaction with customers is typically a highly impactful experience for the team.
		- **"Weird" Practices**
		      Introducing new work methods requires an understanding of your unique depth of knowledge, effective communication, small, safe-to-fail experiments, and the active inclusion of skeptics in the process to gradually shift mindsets and establish new practices.
			- Understanding the challenge of introducing new approaches
				- Recognise your depth of understanding in the new approach may be greater than others', making it difficult for them to grasp.
				- Remember the burden is on you to communicate effectively and provide adequate context.
			- Dealing with resistance
				- Understand that resistance often comes from successful past experiences and ingrained beliefs.
				- Accept that not all methods will work in every context, and leaders will point this out.
			- Implementing change
				- Show, don't tell: demonstrate the benefits of the new approach with tangible outcomes.
				- Propose small, safe-to-fail experiments that won't jeopardise larger projects.
				- If your environment discourages innovation entirely, it may be time to reconsider your position.
			- Involving the skeptics
				- Include skeptics in the discovery process and sense-making activities.
				- Take the time to facilitate these activities properly and ensure they're not seen as an afterthought.
		- **PMs Creating an Environment for Good Decisions / Quickly**
		      A product manager's role should be to create an environment where high-quality decisions can be made swiftly and inclusively, valuing diverse perspectives and using a balance of qualitative and quantitative data to avoid becoming a single point of failure.
			- The Role of a Product Manager
				- Challenge the perception that product managers must be sole decision-makers or idea generators.
				- Understand the risk of becoming a single point of failure, creating a dependency that hinders decision-making when absent.
				- Consider the role as creating an environment where the best decisions can be made swiftly.
			- Decision-Making Quality and Speed
				- Recognize that perfect decisions are often not needed and may be time-consuming, causing missed opportunities.
				- Consider that quick decisions are not always good ones; aim for a balance between speed and quality.
			- Factors Contributing to Good Decision-Making
				- Information: Gather necessary data to guide decisions.
				- Interpretation: Develop skills to interpret data correctly.
				- Models and Frameworks: Use these to de-bias decisions and incorporate diverse perspectives.
				- Team Flow: Facilitate a conducive working environment for making decisions.
				- Feedback Loops: Establish these to refine decisions over time.
				- Safety and Trust: Encourage a safe environment that fosters trust within the team.
				- Alignment: Ensure everyone is moving in the same direction, with access to the same information.
			- Encourage Decentralized Decision-Making
				- Avoid information hoarding; connect the team directly with customers or users.
				- Involve the team in decision-making, valuing their perspectives.
				- Demonstrate decision-making skills to the team, fostering trust.
			- The Role of Diverse Perspectives
				- Acknowledge the benefit of diverse perspectives and input, even if one person makes the final decision.
				- Balance various types of data and input (qualitative and quantitative) to make informed decisions.
		- **Safe places to “workshop” ideas/bets**
		      Creating a safe and collaborative environment where product teams can workshop their bets and pitches, encouraging constructive feedback and skepticism, helps improve the quality of ideas and promotes effective decision-making.
			- Emphasise the value of workshopping your bets
				- Collaborate with teammates, other product managers, and stakeholders involved in crafting these bets
				- Foster an environment that embraces crafting, tweaking, and healthy skepticism
			- Overcome the challenge of skepticism
				- Avoid interpreting skepticism as negativity or competition
				- Educate the team about the importance of skepticism in improving ideas
			- Utilise cross-functional groups for broader perspectives
				- Present backlogs to people close to the work for initial feedback
				- Incorporate insights from outsiders, such as other product managers, designers, or members from other parts of the organisation
			- Practice presenting and refining pitches
				- Continuously practice presenting ideas to figure out what resonates and what falls flat
				- Use first-time pitches as opportunities for immediate improvements
			- Create a safe, low-pressure environment for feedback
				- Distribute one pagers beforehand and solicit feedback in person
				- Encourage vulnerability and welcome a wide range of improvements
			- Cultivate a culture of constructive criticism and skepticism
				- Create safe spaces for workshopping one pagers, bets, ideas, and pitches
				- Encourage positive feedback and constructive criticism without promoting competition.
		- **Expertise as a service (vs. Ticket takers)**
		      The shift in product organisations is towards offering internal expertise, such as data science and UX research, as a service to up level other teams and foster autonomy, shifting away from the traditional model of dependencies and creating a more effective, holistic, and connected product organisation.
			- Shift in certain functions within product organisations:
				- Offering internal expertise as a service, such as data science, analysis, UX research etc.
				- Aim to avoid becoming bottlenecks for product teams.
				- Difficulty in hiring specialised roles to embed in every team.
			- Two models of functioning:
				- Traditional model: Teams work on tickets received from the rest of the product team, creating dependencies.
				- Evolving model: Teams aim to up level others by providing necessary tools, analysis, and information for self-service.
			- Trend in complex product development organisations:
				- Spectrum of how teams function.
				- Willingness to provide services to other teams to ensure their independence.
			- Example of centralised analytics functions:
				- Traditionally, functioned as a question and answer factory.
				- Now, evolving to offer faster and more accurate tools for other teams to use independently.
				- Funded by contributions from all teams, encouraging autonomy and independence.
			- Impact on operations and dev ops:
				- Aim not to create shared services dependent on operations.
				- Instead, aim for independence and centralisation when helpful, not just for cost-cutting.
			- Structuring of product organisation:
				- There will be areas of specialisation.
				- Risks associated with creating silos and dependencies.
				- Importance of allowing connections between teams, embedding when it makes sense, and thinking holistically about what they’re offering.
		- **Reflection is what counts**
		      Implementing a cycle of experimentation, reflection, and continuous improvement in product development teams fosters transparency and better decision-making, while incorporating feedback mechanisms for global practices ensures they work effectively across the organisation.
			- Reflection and follow-up on experiments
				- This helps to reduce "success theater" and increase transparency and honesty.
				- It's essential to project and forecast expected results at the beginning of an effort.
				- Regular decision reviews and follow-ups should be put in place.
				- Avoid revisionist history by being transparent about what was expected and what actually happened.
			- Importance of time and energy investment
				- It's a challenge to carve out time for reflection and follow-up.
				- Avoid creating an overly structured approach that might lead to dishonesty or showing off.
				- Inspire other parts of the company to be more reflective and transparent about their expectations and results.
			- Retrospectives and continuous improvement
				- Retrospectives exemplify the ethos of inspect-and-adapt in agile methodologies.
				- Continuous improvement is difficult and requires safety and organizational support.
				- Larger product teams often neglect retrospectives and continuous improvement.
				- Even teams that are part of a global planning approach should commit to continuous improvement.
			- Product practices and continuous improvement
				- Individual teams handling their own business might overlook larger issues affecting multiple teams.
				- Feedback loops with all involved across the organization are essential.
				- Product teams, teams of teams, and functional groups need to consider their continuous improvement activities.
				- The approach to continuous improvement should be carefully chosen to suit the specific environment.
			- Feedback on global practices
				- Any global practice, like OKRs, needs a mechanism for feedback from the people it affects.
				- Without clear communication and channels for feedback, global practices may not work for everyone involved.
				- Continuous improvement should be considered at all levels, not just at the individual product team level.
		- **Shared understanding / vocabulary is super hard**
		      Effective team communication and shared understanding in a Product environment require continuous discussion, restatement, and repetition, rather than relying solely on documentation or oversimplified definitions.
			- Importance of Shared Understanding
				- People often oversimplify and avoid hard conversations, leading to misunderstandings.
				- Common terms such as "sprint", "vision", "results", "outcomes", or "MVP" can be interpreted differently, causing confusion.
				- There's a need to spend time together, testing each other's understanding and restating things.
			- Role of Measurement
				- Understanding data and business metrics are nuanced and often need detailed explanation.
				- It's difficult but necessary to create comprehensive guides to metrics for products or starter dashboards for understanding.
			- The Problem with Documentation
				- Although documentation might help in some ways, it cannot replace the benefits of active discussion and understanding.
				- Emphasizing too much on defining practices or terms (like MVP) can distract from understanding the underlying ideas.
			- The Necessity of Repetition and Discussion
				- Achieving shared understanding is a continuous process involving repetition, discussion, synthesis, restatement, and testing.
				- It's tempting to avoid these steps, but they are crucial for effective communication and shared understanding.
		- **Connected / Embedded design**
		      The success of a product team heavily depends on the **integration and collaboration of cross-functional members**, including designers, data scientists, and marketers, who should feel like full members of the team, leading to more comprehensive and efficient problem-solving and product development.
	- **[[Product Delivery]]**
	  collapsed:: true
	  To be effective as a product manager, foster a coherent, adaptable team environment that balances short-term tasks with long-term goals, encourages learning and iteration, respects real deadlines, utilises forcing functions for reflection and action, and maintains transparency in managing inter-team dependencies, all while constantly gaining and applying user insights for continuous product improvement.
		- **Coherence and the Messy Middle**
		      Coherence in a team or company context involves the ability to link various levels of work—from short-term tasks to mid-term projects and long-term goals—in a way that is understandable and meaningful to all members, despite inherent uncertainties and differences in perspectives.
			- Difficulty in Connecting Work to Larger Company Bets
				- Frontline workers often struggle to connect their short-term work to the company's long-term goals.
				- The "messy middle" work, which is neither short-term nor long-term, often gets overlooked.
				- Teams often struggle to understand how their work contributes to these mid-term projects and to the larger, long-term missions.
			- Lack of Discussion on Mid-Term Work
				- Short-term and long-term work are often prioritised in discussions, while mid-term work gets less attention.
				- Constant reiteration of the rationale, progress, and changing beliefs regarding mid-term projects is necessary.
			- Linking Work to Outcomes
				- Near-term work often lacks a clear outcome-focus unless the environment involves constant small changes with immediate effects.
				- It can take time to discern the impact of a change or solution on the broader customer experience.
			- Coherence vs Certainty
				- Coherence is not about certainty but about the ability to link together work amidst its messiness and uncertainty.
				- Chasing certainty can limit coherence because certainty can be manufactured and might not reflect the real situation.
				- Coherence involves presenting the real situation in a way that everyone can understand and relate to.
				- Coherence does not require everyone to think the same way; it involves representing and relating different perspectives.
		- **Play Less Tetris**
		      The "Tetris" problem in product management refers to the tendency of managers to constantly load up team members with tasks in a bid to optimize productivity, often at the expense of critical activities like experimentation, contemplation, and exploration.
			- The Tetris Problem in Management
				- Many managers, especially product managers, engage in a behavior similar to playing Tetris, where they try to load up teams with tasks to ensure maximum productivity.
				- This approach often overlooks the importance of slack time and the value of contemplation and exploration.
				- The focus on keeping people busy leads to rushed decision-making, over-constrained commitments, and a reduction in the ability to iterate or explore new options.
			- Side Effects and Implications
				- This mentality leaves less time for experimentation, which is crucial for innovative outcomes.
				- Overemphasis on keeping everyone busy can lead to teams not starting together and excessive dependency wrangling, which can hinder effective collaboration.
				- The Tetris approach can limit the ability to measure and evaluate progress effectively due to predetermined and rigid plans.
			- Breaking the Tetris Habit
				- It's difficult to stop playing Tetris as there is organizational pressure to keep everyone constantly busy.
				- This approach can encourage unhealthy specialization and discourages viewing tasks as a team effort.
				- Organizations should strive to optimize for outcomes and impacts, not just keeping everyone busy.
		- **Moving Fast and Slow**
		      Balancing the bias for frequent integration and action with long-term thinking and iterative exploration can harmonise the pace of learning and shipping, thus improving the overall quality of output in a product team.
			- Concept of Speed in Organization
				- Many organisations emphasise on moving quickly and output, often boasting about the number of features completed in a given period.
				- This rush can sometimes lead to compromising on the quality and thoughtfulness of the output.
				- Contrarily, designers and architects often question this rush, advocating for a more deliberate approach.
			- Balancing Fast and Slow Work Approaches
				- Successful teams incorporate a bias for frequent integration, constantly testing and integrating assumptions to ensure they're on the right track.
				- This approach combines a bias for action (shipping or testing) with long-term thinking and leaving room for iteration and exploration.
				- The aim is to harmonise the pace of learning and shipping, creating a balance between working fast and working slow.
			- Risks of Unbalanced Speed
				- If the focus is solely on shipping quickly, without sufficient room for iteration, the product quality may suffer.
				- This fear of rushed shipping can lead to gold plating and resentment towards iterative practices.
				- The key is to balance the bias for action with the bias for learning, using the power of frequent deployment and integration for a better outcome rather than just output.
		- **Learning Cadence**
		      The concept of learning cadence refers to the frequency and depth of insights a team gains about its customers or users, and how effectively these insights are translated into action to shape the team's current strategies and practices.
			- Understanding Learning Cadence
				- Learning cadence differentiates from shipping or delivery cadence.
				- It involves understanding what the team has learned about customers or users, the depth and volume of that learning, and how it shapes current actions.
				- Important to ask teams about their "Aha! moments" that prompted rethinking and course correction.
			- Responses and Insights
				- Some teams might talk about a strategic shift a few months ago and then being in execution mode.
				- Other teams might have ongoing learnings about user behavior, market feedback, and their own mistakes, which constantly shape their approach.
			- Importance of Learning Velocity
				- It's a measure of how frequently a team learns and adapts, with smaller learnings happening weekly and larger ones perhaps quarterly.
				- Rapid initial learning often occurs during upfront research, followed by a phase of exploiting that learning.
				- Some teams continuously revisit assumptions and verify their trajectory, acting on their learnings.
			- Translating Learning into Action
				- Not just about learning, but acting on that learning, converting knowledge into a change of direction.
				- Teams may gather feedback but not act on it if redirected elsewhere.
				- Differences between teams who can act on learning and those who can't are evident in their conversations.
		- **Left to Right Factory Lines**
		      Product development should be viewed as a complex, interrelated network of feedback loops and value creation, rather than a simple linear factory line, to encourage continuous learning and improvement rather than just delivery of work.
			- Predominant View of Product Development
				- Often seen as a factory line, similar to a work item being moved from "to do" to "done".
				- Many tools reinforce this idea but fail to accurately represent the interrelated and iterative nature of the work.
				- This view is beneficial for visualizing and limiting work in progress, but lacks depth in demonstrating the iterative process and feedback loops.
			- Limitations of This View
				- Doesn't communicate the relationships between work at different levels and its interconnectedness.
				- Doesn't effectively represent the iterative nature of work and the feedback generated.
				- Mainly focuses on delivery, leaving out the broader goals or the "big bets" of a company.
			- Need for Augmented Views
				- To understand the contribution of various releases to improving a specific metric or achieving a mission.
				- To visualize the various feedback loops generated and how they are linked to other tasks.
				- To avoid the harm caused by the factory line mindset, which can overlook the idea of rapid learning, complexity removal, and overall system health.
			- Risks of Overemphasis on Delivery
				- Encourages a "more-is-better" mindset without balancing it against the goal of rapid learning and complexity reduction.
				- Quality can drop as teams slip into reactive failure mode, dealing with issues that take up a lot of time.
				- Without proper representation and consideration, teams may continue to work without making necessary improvements.
			- Emphasizing the Complex System
				- Product development is not just a left-to-right process; it's more like a value creation network with interrelated feedback loops.
				- Understanding this complexity is crucial to avoid falling into the trap of the factory line mindset.
		- **Leaving Time to Iterate**
		      Successful product development relies on finding a balance between clear yet flexible mission framing and early delivery to create opportunities for iterative improvement based on feedback and learning.
			- Common Pain Point
				- Many in product development feel they don't have time to iterate on work done.
			- Consequences of Not Iterating
				- Teams become hesitant to approach work in an incremental, iterative way.
				- Reduced risk-taking and slow delivery of products.
				- Missed opportunities to act on immediate feedback and improve work.
			- Importance of Framing Missions
				- Open-ended missions provide no direction, while overly prescriptive ones leave no room for adaptation.
				- Balance is needed: set flexible but clear goals for each mission.
			- Suggested Approach to Iteration
				- Iterate until a specific target metric is achieved, or until high confidence is established in a particular learning.
				- Reflect weekly on the progress and adjust accordingly.
			- Role of Early Delivery
				- The longer the wait to deliver, the less patience stakeholders have for further iterations.
				- Teams should strive to deliver earlier to identify what works and what doesn't, and to create room for iteration.
		- **The critical moment of realising intuition needs testing**
		      Product often involves confronting unexpected user behaviours and challenging overconfidence, which underscores the importance of usability testing and direct observation as invaluable tools for gaining insights and correcting misperceptions about how users interact with a product.
			- The Unexpected User Behaviour
				- A common experience in product development is realising how incorrect assumptions about user behaviour can be.
				- This often happens when attending usability tests or reviewing quantitative or behavioural data.
			- The Importance of User Testing
				- User testing can help uncover unanticipated user behaviour and misunderstandings.
				- For example, a common issue is when a significant percentage of users don't complete onboarding, forcing a reassessment of the process.
			- Overcoming Overconfidence
				- It's important to create an environment that allows for usability testing and measurement to counteract overconfidence about user behaviour.
				- This can be particularly challenging with subject matter experts, who may assume their expertise extends to user experience or design.
			- The Need for Reality Checks
				- Usability tests and direct observation of users interacting with the product provide valuable reality checks.
				- This feedback can be humbling, but it offers rich data to correct misperceptions and improve the product.
		- **Artificial deadlines**
		      Setting real deadlines based on the potential dramatic drop in value if missed is crucial, while avoiding artificial deadlines, considering the cost of delay, and making transparent, economically-based decisions is key to effective product management.
			- Understanding Deadlines
				- Real Deadlines
					- The value of the task dramatically drops if the deadline is missed.
					- Examples include events or customer-driven deadlines.
					- If missed, it can have serious consequences (e.g., non-payment, loss of value).
				- Artificial Deadlines
					- Deadlines set without a dramatic drop in value if missed.
					- Sometimes used to maintain optics or manage workflow.
					- These can negatively impact team credibility if consistently missed.
			- Recommendations
				- Avoid artificial deadlines
					- They can lead to poor economic decisions and unnecessary stress.
					- They don't reflect the actual value or urgency of a task.
				- Be transparent about real deadlines
					- This involves adjusting scope and resources to meet the deadline.
					- It's important to recognize that adding more people to a project nearing its deadline may not solve the problem.
				- Consider the cost of delay
					- This is the potential loss if a task is delayed by a week, a month, etc.
					- It helps teams make more informed decisions about parallelizing efforts.
		- **Forcing functions are valuable**
		      Healthy forcing functions, such as time-boxed sprints or regular customer exposure, can snap teams out of automatic thought, encourage reflection, and prompt action, but their effectiveness should be regularly assessed and adjusted if necessary.
			- Understanding the Concept of Healthy Forcing Functions
				- Definition: A forcing function is something that snaps you out of automatic thought and forces you to consider what's happening.
				- Examples of Healthy Forcing Functions:
					- Time-boxed sprints are forcing functions that encourage reflection and integration of work done by the team.
					- Regular customer exposure or customer interviews can serve as a forcing function that prompts team reflection and de-biasing.
					- Agreeing to not leave any user stories open over the weekend is a team-enforced function that encourages wrapping up tasks.
			- Misunderstanding and Misuse of Forcing Functions
				- Healthy forcing functions can be misunderstood or misused by other parts of the company.
				- Misinterpretation can lead to resentment from the team who feel it's a tool to extract more work from them.
			- Assessing the Effectiveness of Forcing Functions
				- Evaluate if the forcing function snaps you out of automatic thought and prompts action.
				- If the function isn't effective, consider making it more frequent or altering its nature.
				- Example: A simple status check may not be a strong forcing function, but limiting maximum story sizes to a couple of days could be.
		- **Not hiding dependencies (and dependency wrangling)**
		      When scaling teams, it's crucial to transparently visualise and manage dependencies between teams to maintain productivity, decision-making efficiency, and the flexibility to pursue impactful outcomes.
	- **[[Data]] and [[Measurement]]**
	  collapsed:: true
	  As a product manager, effectively use data by embracing its [[uncertainty]] and using it as a tool for [[continuous learning]] and adjustment, integrating both [[qualitative]] and [[quantitative]] insights, choosing [[metrics]] based on decision needs and value creation, and focusing on long-term customer behaviour to understand usage patterns and assess the product's real-world value.
		- **Data as a Trust Proxy**
		      The effective use of data in decision-making requires acknowledging its uncertainty and adopting a learning stance, understanding that data doesn't provide an absolute truth but helps peel back layers of complexity, and that qualitative insights, instinct, and prior experiences are also important forms of data.
			- Misconceptions about Data
				- There is a common misconception that data serves as a trust proxy, eliminating all disagreements.
				- In truth, effective use of data often leads to more uncertainty and more questions.
			- Role of Data
				- Data should not be viewed as a pass/fail mechanism for teams or projects.
				- Instead, data should be used as a learning tool to better understand what is happening and why.
			- Need for Qualitative Research
				- Despite the power of data, there is still a need for qualitative research and a direct connection with users or customers.
			- The Art of Using Data
				- Using data effectively is often more of an art than a science, involving luck and timing.
				- The idea of running perfect experiments and collecting perfect data is often unrealistic.
			- Misuse of Data
				- Data can be manipulated and warped to back up personal opinions.
				- People's instincts, observations, and prior knowledge are valid data points and should be considered.
			- Creating a Data-Informed Environment
				- To become more data-informed, teams should create an environment safe for uncertainty and open to the iterative use of data.
				- Initially, teams may only have rough KPIs to represent their beliefs, but over time, they can build a deeper understanding of causal relationships and develop predictive models.
		- **Data Snacking vs. Integrated Approach**
		      Effective use of data in Product involves **integrating both qualitative and quantitative data** into all aspects of the process, aligning team goals with business objectives, and employing data for continuous learning and adjustment, rather than just seeking specific answers or pass/fail metrics.
			- Difference between "Data Snacking" and Integrated Approach
				- "Data snacking" is when teams cherry-pick data to support their current projects or answer specific questions.
				- Teams with an integrated approach weave qualitative and quantitative data into all aspects of product development.
			- Role of Data in Various Facets of the Product process
				- Data can provide context in kickoffs, support strategy through metrics and beliefs, and reflect on past performance.
				- A consistent language around metrics and results ties various efforts together, creating a common thread throughout projects.
			- Alignment of Team and Business Goals
				- In some cases, team-specific Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) may not align with the larger business model or the C-suite's objectives, leading to disconnect.
				- Successful teams tie their OKRs into the larger approach, ensuring alignment with overall business goals.
			- Using Data for Learning
				- Great teams will use data as a framework throughout a mission to reflect on progress and adjust their strategy.
				- This approach values data for learning and reflection, rather than as a pass/fail metric or a source of a "magic insight" that will solve all problems.
				- A rigorous, cyclical process of reflection using various forms of data is characteristic of teams with a healthy perspective on data usage.
		- **Measurement to inform decisions**
		      The choice of metrics to measure in a team should be guided by the decisions that need to be made, areas of uncertainty that need clarity, and a model of how value is generated and stored in the business, rather than just a fear of choosing the wrong metric or the pressure for certainty.
			- Obsession with Metrics
				- Teams often worry about choosing the right metrics to measure.
				- Fear of being judged or penalized in their organization for choosing the wrong metric.
			- Dependence on Frameworks
				- Teams look for precise guidelines on what to measure.
				- Some common metrics (like customer acquisition cost or lifetime value) are ubiquitous across industries.
			- Relationship Between Metrics and Decisions
				- Metrics should be related to the decisions that need to be made and areas of uncertainty.
				- Teams might struggle to decompose their strategy or bets into measurable components due to lack of skills or fear.
			- Pressure for Certainty
				- Other parts of the company might demand a high level of certainty.
				- Teams strive for the perfect, bulletproof metric, which is rarely attainable in product development.
			- Identifying Big Bets and Reducing Uncertainty
				- Teams need to identify their big bets and areas where they need to reduce uncertainty.
				- They should also monitor what's currently working and any assumptions that could have potential impact.
			- Building a Model for Value Generation
				- Teams should measure aspects that help build a model of how value is generated and stored in their business.
				- They need to understand the behaviors that make the most successful customers.
				- This may not directly relate to immediate decisions, but can influence long-term strategic changes.
		- ****A longer-term view of customers…LTV and behavioral cohorts****
		      Analysing customer behaviour over a long-term period is crucial to understanding subtle usage patterns, identifying effective versus struggling customers, and taking a holistic measurement approach that assesses whether a product is realising its intended value and changing customers' businesses.
