	- There are several design patterns that can be used when exposing #workflow #logic to the #front-end via a #back-end [[API]]. Some of the most relevant patterns include:
		- [[Command pattern]]: This pattern involves encapsulating a request as an object, allowing the request to be passed around as a command. This can be useful for exposing workflow logic as a series of discrete steps that can be triggered by the front-end.
		- [[Mediator pattern]]: This pattern involves encapsulating communication between objects in a separate mediator object, allowing the front-end to interact with the back-end API through a single interface. This can be useful for complex workflow logic that involves multiple back-end components.
		- [[State pattern]]: This pattern involves encapsulating the state of an object and separating it from the object's behavior. This can be useful for exposing the current state of a workflow to the front-end, as well as for allowing the front-end to trigger transitions between states.
		- [[Observer pattern]]: This pattern involves defining a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all of its dependencies are notified and updated automatically. This can be useful for exposing real-time updates on the status of a workflow to the front-end.
		- It's important to note that the appropriate design pattern will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your workflow logic and API. It may be necessary to use a combination of these patterns, or to use a different pattern entirely, in order to effectively expose your workflow logic to the front-end.
