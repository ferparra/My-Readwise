			- Background
			  
			  A Fourier analysis is a tool for representing a signal as a sum of sinusoidal components. It is used in a variety of applications, such as signal processing, communications, and control systems.
			  
			  The Fourier transform of a signal x(t) is defined as:
			  
			  X(f) = ∫x(t)e^{-j2πft}dt
			  
			  where j is the imaginary unit and f is the frequency.
			  
			  In this assignment, you will implement a Fourier transform in Python. You will also apply it to a signal from a real-world application.
			  
			  Task
			  
			  Write a program that takes as input a signal x(t) and outputs its Fourier transform X(f). Your program should be able to handle signals of arbitrary length.
			  
			  You can use the fft function in the scipy.fftpack module to compute the Fourier transform.
			  
			  Apply your program to the following signal:
			  
			  x(t) = 3*cos(2*pi*10*t) + 5*sin(2*pi*15*t)
			  
			  What is the frequency of the largest component in the Fourier transform? Is this the same as the frequency of the signal?
			  
			  Submit your Python code and the answer to the above question.
