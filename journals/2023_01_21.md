- [[Anthropocentrism]] is the belief that human beings are the central or most important entity in the universe [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocentrism). It has been posited by some environmentalists and defended by authors such as Wesley J. Smith from the Discovery Institute [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocentrism). [[Anthropocentrism]] has been criticized by animal rights and welfare advocates, who argue that like humans, non-human animals also have value and should be treated with respect [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocentrism). Several authors have written about antianthropocentrism, which is a philosophical position that rejects anthropocentrism. Martin [[Heidegger]]'s later #philosophy proposes that #authentic [[human existence]] consists in realizing that humans are but one element in the fourfold, and not necessarily the most important one [1](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/19144978.pdf). Hans Christian Andersen wrote 'The Darning Needle' in 1846, which was an example of post-anthropocentric approaches to fiction [3](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctv1c29st4). Quentin Meillassoux's description of anti-anthropocentrism argues for a supreme #human #value while rejecting anthropocentrism [4](https://edinburgh.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.3366/edinburgh/9781474414739.001.0001/upso-9781474414739-chapter-003).

	- [[Agile]] estimation techniques are used by teams using [[agile]] approaches such as [[Scrum]] and [[Extreme Programming]] to estimate the effort required to complete a project. [[Story points]] are used to measure the effort required, rather than traditional units of time. Agile estimation can help reduce the [[risk]] of exceeding [[budget]]s and [[timeline]]s, and can provide [[benefits]] such as improved [[sprint planning]] and [[product backlog]] management. Different techniques may be more suitable for different projects, so it is important to be aware of project requirements when choosing an appropriate method.
