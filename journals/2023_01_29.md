	- 10 [[flashcards]] about [[cellular biology]]
		- [[Cell membrane]]: A thin, flexible barrier that surrounds the cell and separates the inside from the outside environment. It is composed of lipids and proteins and controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell.
		- [[Cytoplasm]]: The gel-like substance inside the cell that contains all of the cell's organelles. It is composed of water, salts, and organic molecules.
		- [[Nucleus]]: A large, spherical organelle that is located in the center of the cell. It contains the cell's genetic material, which is organized into chromosomes.
		- [[Ribosomes]]: Tiny organelles that are found throughout the cytoplasm. They are responsible for synthesizing proteins using the instructions provided by the genetic material in the nucleus.
		- [[Mitochondria]]: Organelles that are responsible for producing the energy needed by the cell to carry out its functions. They are known as the "powerhouses" of the cell.
		- [[Endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER): A network of flattened sacs and tubes that is involved in the synthesis and transport of proteins and lipids. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is involved in the synthesis of lipids, while the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is involved in protein synthesis.
		- [[Golgi apparatus]]: A stack of flattened sacs that is involved in the sorting, modification, and transport of proteins and lipids within the cell.
		- [[Lysosomes]]: Small, spherical organelles that contain enzymes that can break down and recycle waste products and foreign substances within the cell.
		- [[Peroxisomes]]: Small, spherical organelles that contain enzymes that detoxify harmful substances and break down fatty acids and amino acids.
		- [[Chloroplasts]]: Organelles found in plant cells that are responsible for photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, a pigment that absorbs light energy.
