		- [[Jobs to be Done Canvas]]: This is a tool developed by Intercom that helps you to understand the progress that customers are trying to make in their lives and the specific job they are hiring your product to do. It consists of four quadrants: the Job, the Progress, the Forces, and the Outcome.
