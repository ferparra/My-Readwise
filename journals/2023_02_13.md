- On [[Stoicism]]
	- Modern Stoicism, or [[neo-Stoicism]], is a revival and reimagining of the ancient [[philosophy]] of Stoicism. While it draws heavily from the teachings of the ancient Stoics, it also incorporates ideas from contemporary philosophy and addresses some of the criticisms leveled against the original philosophy.
	- Regarding [[determinism]], modern Stoicism takes a nuanced view that is not necessarily the same as the ancient Stoics. In general, modern Stoics are less dogmatic about determinism, and instead focus on developing a sense of personal [[agency]] and [[responsibility]] for one's actions. While they acknowledge that some aspects of life may be beyond our control, they also emphasize the importance of choosing our attitudes and responses to the events that happen to us.
	- As for [[materialism]], modern Stoicism often embraces a more holistic view of the self that transcends the material world. While they acknowledge the importance of [[material possessions]], they also emphasize the importance of [[spiritual]] and emotional well-being, and the development of [[character]] and [[virtue]].
		- Modern practice of [[virtue]]:
			- [[Mindfulness]] and [[reflection]]: This involves regularly taking time to reflect on one's thoughts, emotions, and actions, and examining them in light of Stoic principles, such as the distinction between things in our control and things not in our control. This can help to cultivate [[wisdom]] and [[self-awareness]].
				- In addition to mindfulness and self-reflection, Stoics use several other tools to help understand what is in their control and what is not. Some of these tools include:
					- [[The Dichotomy of Control]]: The Stoics developed the idea of the "dichotomy of control" to help individuals distinguish between things that are within their control and things that are not. Essentially, they believe that some things are under our control (such as our thoughts, emotions, and actions), while other things are not (such as external events, other people's behavior, and natural occurrences). By recognizing what is in their control and what is not, individuals can focus their attention and efforts on what is within their control, and avoid wasting energy on things that are not.
					- [[Cognitive Distortion]]: Stoics also employ cognitive techniques, such as cognitive distortion, to help them understand and regulate their thoughts and emotions. This involves recognizing and challenging negative or irrational thoughts, and replacing them with more positive, realistic, and helpful thoughts.
					- [[The View from Above]]: Stoics also use the concept of the "view from above," which involves imagining oneself as a detached observer, looking down on the situation from a higher perspective. This can help individuals to gain a broader perspective, and to see things in a more objective and detached way.
					- [[Negative Visualization]]: The Stoics also employ the technique of negative visualization, which involves imagining the worst-case scenario in a given situation. This can help individuals to prepare for potential difficulties, to develop resilience, and to appreciate the good things in their life.
						- Here are some practical tools and prompts to practice negative visualization more effectively:
							- Visualize a specific situation: Choose a specific situation, such as losing a job or a loved one, and imagine how you would handle it. This can help you to prepare for potential difficulties and to develop resilience.
							- Practice regularly: Set aside a specific time each day, such as in the morning or before bed, to practice negative visualization. This can help you to make it a habit and to become more comfortable with the technique.
							- Be specific: When visualizing a difficult situation, be as specific as possible. Imagine the details of the situation, including the emotions and thoughts you would experience.
							- Focus on your response: Rather than focusing on the negative event itself, focus on your response to the situation. Imagine how you would handle the situation with [[grace]], [[wisdom]], and [[equanimity]].
							- Acknowledge the good things: After practicing negative visualization, take a moment to acknowledge and appreciate the good things in your life. This can help you to maintain a sense of perspective and [[gratitude]].
							- Use [[mindfulness]]: When practicing negative visualization, use mindfulness to stay present and focused. This can help you to avoid getting caught up in worry or fear.
							- Reflect on your progress: After practicing negative visualization, reflect on how you felt and what you learned. This can help you to understand your own thoughts and emotions, and to make any necessary adjustments.
					- [[Journaling]]: Another tool that modern Stoics may use is journaling, which involves regularly reflecting on one's thoughts, emotions, and experiences. This can be a powerful tool for self-reflection and self-awareness, and can help individuals to understand their own motivations and beliefs, and to track their progress over time.
						- Stoic journaling typically involves regularly reflecting on one's thoughts, emotions, and experiences, with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding of oneself and of the world around them. Stoics can ask themselves the following questions regularly to understand if they are living a virtuous life and aligning with their values:
							- How did I respond to challenges and difficulties today? Did I maintain my composure and handle the situation with equanimity and wisdom?
							- How did I behave towards others today? Did I act with kindness, compassion, and fairness, or did I behave in a way that was selfish or harmful to others?
							- Did I focus on things that were within my control, or did I waste energy on things that were beyond my control?
							- Did I maintain a sense of perspective and detachment, or did I become overly attached to things or outcomes?
							- How did I practice [[gratitude]] and appreciation today? Did I take time to acknowledge and appreciate the good things in my life?
							- Did I practice self-discipline and self-control, or did I give in to my desires and impulses?
			- [[Emotional regulation]]: This involves learning to manage one's emotions in a healthy and constructive way, rather than allowing them to control one's actions. This can help to cultivate [[courage]], [[justice]], and [[temperance]].
			- [[Active engagement]] with the world: This involves actively engaging with the world and taking responsibility for one's actions, rather than passively accepting things as they are. This can help to cultivate [[wisdom]] and [[courage]].
			- Practicing [[virtue]] in daily life: This involves actively seeking out opportunities to practice Stoic virtues in everyday life, such as by being honest, fair, and compassionate in one's interactions with others. This can help to cultivate [[justice]] and [[temperance]].
				- On [[justice]]:
					- Modern Stoicism views [[justice]] as a cardinal [[virtue]], and one of the four primary virtues along with [[wisdom]], [[courage]], and [[temperance]]. The Stoic concept of [[justice]] is rooted in the idea that all people are rational beings and are therefore equal in dignity and worth. As a result, Stoics believe that justice requires treating all people fairly and with respect.
					- One way modern Stoics avoid coming across as arrogant is by embracing the Stoic concept of [[humility]], which involves recognizing one's own limitations and acknowledging that one does not have all the answers. This can help to prevent individuals from becoming overly confident in their beliefs and from treating others as inferior.
					- Additionally, modern Stoics emphasize the importance of practicing [[empathy]] and [[compassion]], and recognizing the inherent [[interconnectedness]] of all people and all things. This can help to foster a sense of humility and respect for others, and to counteract any tendencies towards [[arrogance]].
					- Another way modern Stoics avoid [[arrogance]] is by focusing on the inner work of developing their own [[character]] and [[virtue]], rather than trying to impose their views on others or to convert others to their philosophy. Modern Stoicism is often seen as a [[personal philosophy]], rather than a prescriptive ideology, and individuals are encouraged to use it in a way that works best for them, rather than trying to impose it on others.
					- Overall, modern Stoicism emphasizes the importance of balancing the pursuit of [[wisdom]] and virtue with [[humility]], [[compassion]], and respect for others, and seeks to avoid the pitfalls of [[arrogance]] and [[dogmatism]].
	- The Stoics believe that negative emotions such as [[grief]], [[anger]], and [[fear]] can interfere with our ability to act wisely and in accordance with reason. However, they also acknowledge that these emotions are a natural and unavoidable part of human experience. To contend with these emotions, the Stoics employ several strategies:
		- Understanding the nature of the [[emotions]]: The Stoics believe that negative emotions stem from a distorted or mistaken understanding of the situation. By examining the situation objectively and gaining a clearer understanding of what is within and beyond our control, we can reduce the grip of the emotions.
		- Practicing [[acceptance]]: The Stoics believe that it is not the events themselves that cause us suffering, but rather our thoughts and beliefs about the events. By practicing acceptance and embracing what is outside of our control, we can reduce our emotional suffering.
		- Cultivating [[compassion]]: The Stoics believe that compassion and love are important virtues and that they can be cultivated through practice. By focusing on the well-being of others, and by practicing empathy and understanding, we can reduce our own emotional suffering and become more compassionate.
		- Using [[negative visualization]]: The Stoics employ negative visualization as a way to prepare for and accept the loss of loved ones. By imagining and accepting the possibility of loss in advance, we can reduce the shock and grief that may accompany the loss.
		- In response to the myth that Stoics are cold and calculated, it is important to note that the Stoics do not advocate for suppressing or denying our emotions. Instead, they believe that by examining and understanding our emotions, and by practicing acceptance and compassion, we can reduce their negative impact on our lives and become more virtuous individuals.
			- Stoicism encourages [[compassion]] and [[love]], and it is not in conflict with these emotions. Stoicism is about finding a balance between our emotional and rational selves, and it is about cultivating wisdom and virtuous living, not about suppressing our emotions.
	- On [[anger]]
		- To the Stoics, [[anger]] is seen as a natural and understandable emotion, but one that should be examined critically and approached with caution. The Stoics believe that anger is often the result of a perceived wrong or injustice, but that it can quickly spiral out of control and lead to destructive behavior.
		- The Stoics believe that anger can be productive when it is directed towards promoting [[justice]] and promoting the common good. When anger is aligned with [[reason]] and [[virtue]], it can serve as a motivator to right wrongs and improve the world.
		- Some famous Stoic quotes related to anger include:
			- "He who lacks the power to control his passions, lacks the power to control his life." - [[Epictetus]] #quotes
			- "Anger is like those ruins which smash themselves on what they fall." - [[Seneca]] #quotes
			- "It is the sign of a great mind to dislike greatness, and to prefer things in measure to things in excess." - [[Marcus Aurelius]] #quotes
			- "The best way to avenge yourself is to be unlike your enemy." - [[Marcus Aurelius]] #quotes
		- These quotes illustrate the Stoic belief that anger can be a powerful but dangerous emotion, and that it should be approached with caution and directed towards virtuous ends. By examining our own anger and approaching it with reason and virtue, we can use it to improve the world and our own lives.
	- [[Reacting]] and [[responding]] are two different approaches to dealing with life's challenges and events, according to the Stoics.
		- [[Reacting]] is impulsive and often driven by emotions and desires, without any reflection or regulation. When we react, we may act impulsively, without considering the consequences of our actions or the needs of others. This can lead to harmful or irrational behavior.
		- [[Responding]], on the other hand, involves taking a step back, practicing [[patience]], and reflecting on our thoughts, [[beliefs]], and [[actions]] before [[acting]]. By responding instead of reacting, we can make more informed and virtuous decisions, based on our own values and beliefs, and in line with our goals and aspirations.
		- Here are a few famous quotes that reflect this balance between reacting and responding:
			- "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it." - [[Seneca]]
			- "The best revenge is massive success." -[[Frank Ocean]]
			- "We do not control what happens to us, but we can control our reaction to it." - [[Epictetus]]
			- "[[Patience]] is the companion of [[wisdom]]." - [[St. Augustine]]
			- "The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today." - [[Seneca]]
		- These quotes emphasize the importance of taking control of our thoughts, beliefs, and actions, and responding to life's challenges with wisdom, patience, and equanimity, rather than succumbing to impulses and emotions. By doing so, we can cultivate a more fulfilling and [[meaningful life]].
	- On the shortness of [[life]]:
		- The Stoics believed that life is long enough to practice patience and virtue, but at the same time, it is also short and uncertain. They believed that every moment of life is precious and should be used wisely.
		- Here are a few famous quotes that embody the Stoic perspective on the paradox of life being both short and long:
			- "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it." - [[Seneca]] #quotes
			- "Do not waste time; it is the stuff life is made of." - [[Benjamin Franklin]] #quotes
			- "We do not control what happens to us, but we can control our reaction to it." - [[Epictetus]] #quotes
			- "The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today." - [[Seneca]] #quotes
		- These quotes emphasize the importance of living in the [[present moment]] and making the most of every opportunity. By focusing on what is within our control and developing our character and virtue, we can lead a meaningful and fulfilling life, regardless of its length. At the same time, the Stoics also caution against being overly impulsive or hasty, reminding us to take a measured approach to life and to be mindful of our thoughts and actions.
	- On [[death]]
		- The Stoics believed that death is a natural part of life and should not be feared. They argued that the fear of death is based on the assumption that death is an evil, which is not the case according to Stoic philosophy. Instead, they believed that death is simply a change or a transition, and that the body and material possessions are not what give our lives meaning and purpose.
		- Here are a few famous quotes that demonstrate the Stoic perspective on death:
			- "You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength." - [[Marcus Aurelius]] #quotes
			- "It is not that we have a short life, but that we waste a lot of it." - [[Seneca]] #quotes
			- "The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane." - [[Marcus Aurelius]] #quotes
			- "It is not that we die, but that we die unfulfilled." - [[Epictetus]] #quotes
	- In the last century, there have been several writers and philosophers who have been influenced by Stoicism and who share similarities with modern Stoicism. Here are a few examples:
		- [[Albert Camus]] - Camus was a French philosopher and writer who was influenced by Stoicism and its emphasis on the importance of personal freedom and responsibility. He believed that life is [[meaningless]], but that individuals can still find [[purpose]] and meaning by embracing the absurd and accepting their own mortality.
		- [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] - Nietzsche was a German philosopher who shared many of the Stoic beliefs, particularly in his emphasis on the importance of [[self-mastery]] and [[self-creation]]. He believed that individuals must overcome their fears and limitations in order to live a fulfilling life.
		- [[Martin Heidegger]] - Heidegger was a German philosopher who shared many of the Stoic beliefs, particularly in his emphasis on the importance of [[mindfulness]] and [[self-reflection]]. He believed that individuals must develop a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them in order to live a fulfilling life.
		- [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] - Emerson was an American philosopher and writer who was influenced by Stoicism and its emphasis on the importance of personal responsibility and self-reliance. He believed that individuals must embrace their own inner wisdom and live according to their own values in order to achieve a sense of happiness and fulfillment.
		- [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] - Krishnamurti was an Indian philosopher who shared many of the Stoic beliefs, particularly in his emphasis on the importance of mindfulness and self-awareness. He believed that individuals must learn to live in the present moment and to cultivate a sense of inner peace in order to achieve a sense of fulfillment.
	- Critiques to stoicism
		- There have been several critiques of Stoicism over the years, some of the most well-known ones include:

			- [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] - He criticized Stoicism for its emphasis on reason and rationality, which he saw as stifling creativity and individual freedom.
			- [[Michel Foucault]] - He criticized Stoicism for its view of the self as an isolated, detached entity and its focus on individual control and autonomy, which he saw as an expression of power and domination.
			- [[Søren Kierkegaard]] - He criticized Stoicism for its lack of attention to the emotional and subjective aspects of human experience and its focus on universal principles and rationality.
			- [[Theodor Adorno]] - He criticized Stoicism for its emphasis on emotional detachment, which he saw as a form of oppression and an impediment to authentic emotional expression.
