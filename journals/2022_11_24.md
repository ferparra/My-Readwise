- List of areas of responsibility of a Product Manager in relationship to product delivery, continuous discovery, roadmap, stakeholder management, etc
	- The product manager is responsible for the product delivery, continuous discovery, roadmap, strategy, and stakeholder relationships.
	- They work with the development team to ensure that the product is delivered on time and to the required quality standards.
	- They also work with the business stakeholders to ensure that the product meets their needs and aligns with the business strategy.
	- The product manager also needs to maintain a good relationship with the stakeholders, as they are the ones who will be using the product and will be impacted by the product decisions.
- #prioritization methods
	- List of advantages and disadvantages of using weighted shortest job first ([[WSJF]]) as a priotization method for building successful digital products.
		- #advantages
			- [[WSJF]] can help ensure that the most important features are prioritized and delivered first.
			- It can help ensure that the [[Product Backlog]] is continually being refreshed with the most important items.
			- It can help ensure that the product is continuously delivering value to the customer.
		- #disadvantages
			- There is no guarantee that the highest priority items will always be delivered first.
			- It can be difficult to accurately estimate the value of each item in the product backlog.
			- The priority of items in the product backlog can change over time, which can make it difficult to keep track of what needs to be delivered first.
	- List of advantages and disadvantages of using "cost of delay" as a priotization method for building successful digital products.
		- #advantages
			- Provides a clear and objective way to prioritize projects and features.
			- Can help teams to avoid the common pitfall of building features that are not valuable to the customer.
			- Can be a helpful tool in scoping and planning projects, as it can help to identify which features are most important to the customer.
		- #disadvantages
			- Can be difficult to calculate, and there is potential for disagreement among team members about the calculation itself.
			- Can be viewed as a purely financial metric, which can lead to a myopic focus on short-term gains rather than long-term benefits.
			- Can inadvertently encourage "rush features" that are pushed out the door before they are ready, leading to a poorer quality product.
	- List of advantages and disadvantages of using "RICE scoring model" (reach, impact, confidence, ease) as a priotization method for building successful digital products.
		- Advantages:
		  * The RICE #scoring model provides a simple and straightforward framework for prioritizing features and functionality when building digital products.
		  * RICE scoring takes into account both the potential benefits and the likelihood of success for each proposed feature, making it a more comprehensive tool than other methods that may only consider one or the other.
		  * The model is easy to use and can be applied to a wide variety of digital product development scenarios.
		  
		  Disadvantages:
		  * RICE scoring does not account for all possible factors that may impact the success of a digital product, such as market trends or changes in technology.
		  * The model may be too simplistic for some products, which may require a more complex approach to prioritization.
		  * The ease of use may also lead to feeling over-confident in the accuracy of the RICE scores, which could result in poor decision-making.
