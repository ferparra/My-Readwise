	- Scapegoating
		- [[Scapegoating]] is the process of blaming, vilifying, or holding responsible an individual or group for a problem or conflict in order to create a sense of unity within a larger group. Scapegoating is often used as a form of collective [[punishment]], where members of a group are targeted for a problem caused by another member of that group. This allows the group to remain unified by providing a common enemy for the members to rally against and blame for their difficulties. Scapegoating creates a sense of unity by allowing members of the group to focus their [[anger]] and frustration towards a single source. Additionally, it often serves to deflect responsibility from the larger group, providing an easy target for blame and helping to protect the group from criticism.

		- Introduction
			- In this text, Jonathan Bi and Jim O'Shaughnessy explore the theories of philosopher Rene Girard, who believes that understanding the mimetic mechanism and scapegoating can help prevent global violence. They also discuss the importance of introspection and meditation to understand the importance of metaphysical desire as the core psychological motor of humanity. Lastly, they note that Girard's theories are only one part of the human psyche, but are still explanatory in many domains.
			- Flourishing and Suffering in the Modern Era
				- Human beings are unreliable narrators, fundamentally confabulating and always starring themselves as the hero in their own story.
				- The Eiffel Tower was meant to symbolize a glorious human future where we could engineer ourselves away from suffering.
				- The podcast discusses how we often assume that we know all there is to know until something new and novel comes along. For example, before the invention of the microscope, humans were unaware of microscopic life and were "tuned out". With the invention of the microscope, humans were "tuned in" to a new level of knowledge. Similarly, with the emergence of a new literary style such as James Joyce, people were "tuned in" to a different perspective.
				- The author refers to the historical context in which we were raised, and the effect of technology in the last 62 years, to emphasize the idea that technology can be used for both human flourishing and inflicting human suffering. They suggest that this is largely due to the world having been relatively peaceful in the past 62 years, and technology having been used for positive outcomes. However, this could change in the future, and technology could become a tool of mass destruction.
		- Humiliation Leads to Dangerous Consequences
			- [[Will Storr]]'s hypothesis was that humiliation of a nation or person can lead to dangerous consequences, as evidenced by the example of Germany after World War I. After being humiliated by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, a door was opened for the madman Hitler and the consequences that followed.
		- Girard: The Rescuer of Spirit in Modernity
			- The author argues that the economic theories they have been taught are fallacious, since they do not take into account the role of human emotion in economic exchanges. They believe that decisions are made emotionally and then rationalized after the fact.
			- The author suggests that modernity has systematically removed spirit from the equation, and replaced it with a focus on rational behavior. They also assert that people are not just utility maximizers, but are also spirited creatures concerned with their own social standing and what possessions say about them.
		- The Power of the Spirit
			- Let's take a platonic idea of the soul. There is an appetitive part and a rational part. The appetitive part is driven by sex and food, the animal natures. The rational part is not just about optimizing for sex and food, but it has its own good: truth, reason.
			- Greeks have long held to the notion that the human soul is composed of three parts: physical body, appetite, and spirit. This idea is widely explored in the renowned Greek stories of The Iliad and The Odyssey which focus on the concept of honor and glory, which come from the spirit. These tales recount the story of Achilles, a hero with a goddess mother, who has a prophecy that if he stays and fights in the Trojan War, his physical body will perish but his spirit and honor will be immortalized. On the other hand, if he returns home, his spirit and honor will be lost, but his physical body will live for a long time.
			- The same thought process can be seen in the area of economics as well. Contrary to popular belief, humans are not simply rational utility-maximizing creatures, but spirited ones. We are not only concerned with how our possessions compare to those of others, but how they reflect upon us in terms of our social standing. As Girard discovered, humans are mimetic creatures, capable of creating mythical stories.
			- In [[investing]] or when making a deal, terms and return on investment are not always the most important factors; rather, according to Girard, what matters is not the money itself but what it symbolizes. People involved in capitalism may claim to be motivated by altruistic reasons, such as wanting to save the world, when in reality they are driven by a desire for glory. Thus, it is not about the money, but what the money says about them.
			- Modernity has largely overlooked the power of spirit by removing it from the equation and discounting the importance of reason, which is truth. People now view each other as rational creatures, disregarding the idea of honor and glory and the significance of the soul. The stories of The Iliad and The Odyssey demonstrate the strength of the spirit and how it can transcend physical mortality. Girard is seen as the rescuer of spirit since he is able to explain the logic behind why people can be irrational, even when treated as if they were utility-maximizing. He is able to explain how metaphysical desire, a desire for greatness, is a valid striving and how people are fundamentally spirited and social, rather than just focusing on utility.
			- Girard believes that what sets humans apart from animals is not our ability to grasp truth, but our ability to believe in lies. He identifies that humans have a metaphysical desire for greatness and a potential for violence that is greater than ever before. He also suggests that this metaphysical desire is easily spread between people who think of themselves as equals. All of this leads him to conclude that humans are mimetic creatures.
			- Girard and Buddhism agree that metaphysical desire is the core psychological motor of humanity, and that this desire is for the self to be an all-lasting, all-powerful and most real for social reality. The author further states that the Buddhist conception of emptiness is supposed to alleviate us from this ontological yearning. However, the author is confused as to whether Nietzsche, Girard or the Buddhists are right about this.
			- They refer to Girard as an apocalyptic thinker, due to his pessimistic views on the world and his predictions of global violence and catastrophe. He believed that humanity had failed in the task of saving itself, and that Christ had taken off the "training wheels" of civilization. Furthermore, Girard predicted that the world would go to hell due to people's drive to be powerful in their relationships.
			- The author refers to the Buddhist conception of emptiness as a way to recognize that one's self is impermanent and transitory, but still interdependent. Through practices such as intellectual study and meditation, specifically vipassanā, this emptiness is supposed to be ingrained into individuals, which is thought to alleviate them from the memetic frenzy and contagion of metaphysical desire.
			- The things in the world (exemplified as the earplug that Jonathan holds in his hand on camera) are not permanent entities, but rather constructs of atoms that are constantly entering and leaving it. However, from a human perspective, the earplug is seen as a single, lasting entity that moves through space and time. This is due to the labels and conceptual models that humans have created for it, rather than any objective arrangement in the world.
			- Girard and the Buddhists agree that humans mistakenly think a great deal of phenomenon are not impermanent, and that this thinking can lead to individuals trying to be impermanent, trying to be the most real and trying to be all powerful.
		- More notes
			- In the 19th century, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution gained traction, and soon human-ape skulls started appearing all over the world. French philosopher René Girard argued that people didn't accept the evidence of the skull until they accepted the idea of human evolution from apes. This was despite the lack of evidence for the theory. Rather, it was the narrative that Darwin had created which was accepted and embraced, and this was what changed people's minds. As a result, people began to see evidence for the theory everywhere, when in fact, there was little evidence for it. This example shows that science is often as much about the narrative as it is about the evidence.
			- We all have blinders on based on the mimetic narratives we have. The more troubling version of this is the story of eugenics in the twentieth century, which was seen as a valid science and was supported by influential figures such as Herman Mueller and Theodore Roosevelt. It was based on Charles Darwin's biology and was used to develop modern statistics. However, nowadays, we consider eugenics to be a pseudoscience, or worse, not a science at all.
			- Girard is trying to show us that we should not put too much faith in science, as it did not have the power to stop something like eugenics. What is worse than science not stopping it, is that the reason we stopped eugenics had very little to do with science. It was because it became associated with the Nazis. The Nazis became the embodiment of evil, and so everything around them became highly suspicious. This is why the Italian Futurists are also viewed with suspicion in contemporary society. This all goes to show that even in the domain of science, where we think reason should reign, that is not the whole story.
			- The idea that humans create gods and sanctify certain things has been around for millennia. It is an idea that has been accepted and embraced by many cultures, as it creates a sense of security and purpose for those who follow it. However, when humans create gods and sanctify something, it can also create the conditions for doctrine to take hold, which can become untestable and unquestionable. In the past, going against such doctrine was often seen as heresy and could lead to the punishment of death.
			- The same can be said of science, which has exercised its influence and completely ignored a whole series of valid phenomena. The limitations of science have been mistaken for an ontological theory, and anything outside of its domain is seen as invalid. This is exemplified by the behaviorists of the 20th century, such as B.F. Skinner, who believed that all meaningful things about humans can be understood by external, observable phenomena. This ignores the internal aspects of humans, such as introspection and meditation, which are often essential for understanding people.
			- The idea of humans creating gods is not a new one, and it has been around for centuries. When humans create gods, it is like they are declaring something as special and untouchable, something that cannot be questioned. This can lead to a sense of security, but it also leads to a lack of questioning and a lack of progress. Science has done something similar in a way, in that it has limited its scope of knowledge and declared certain things as invalid, even if they are real. This means that science has mistaken what it can study and understand for what is actually true in the world.
			- [[Buddhism]]'s [[cosmology]] may have stronger epistemic foundations than other religions, such as [[Christianity]]. This is because, like we have telescopes to observe the physical world, they have a finely-tuned instrument to understand the human soul: meditation. I'm open to the possibility that, through [[meditation]] and [[introspection]], one can gain insights that cannot be attained through other means – though I'm not necessarily agreeing with this notion.
			- An overview of Girard's psychology suggests that there are two types of [[desire]]: physical and metaphysical. Physical desire is focused on the utility of things, while metaphysical desire is focused on identity. For example, one may seek sex out of physical desire for [[pleasure]] or intimacy, or out of metaphysical desire for the [[power]] or [[status]] associated with it. This extends to many domains, such as investment banking, where most people are motivated by the status associated with the job, while those in philosophy are motivated by the interest in truth, as there is no status associated with it.
			- People are influenced by the opinions of others when it comes to metaphysical desire because they want to be seen as important. Physical and metaphysical desires compete with each other for our attention.
			- An asset is something of value that you own, such as a house or a car. However, an asset with a series of cash flows attached to it is vastly different from one relying solely on the "price to magic ratio". This type of asset is based on the assumption that magical things will happen and magical thinking will work.
			- Sir Isaac Newton once famously said, “I can measure the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of men”, emphasizing the emotional nature of markets. This sentiment was made even more evident during the South Sea Trading bubble. At the time, people wrote poems about the stock, with one such poem being “Fill the South Sea goblet bowl; the gods shall of our stock take care; Europa pleased accepts the Bull, and Jove with joy puts off the Bear.”
			- The South Sea Trading bubble demonstrates how people can be so swept away in emotions that they forget the realities of investing.
			- Dante's work, the Commedia, is a masterpiece of literature. In the third part of this work, the poet takes the reader back in time to explore the journey of Odysseus. This character, from Greek mythology, left his home and journeyed far, eventually committing a sin of transgression. Dante wrote beautiful poetry about Odysseus' journey, and in it he talks about seeing the shoreline where Europa was. This is meant to illustrate a moral lesson, that transgression can lead to a legitimate striving.
			- What this shows is a reflection of the struggle between desire and modernity. Odysseus committed a sin of transgression, but he was also on a quest for something greater than himself. Therefore, Dante's writing about Odysseus and the shoreline of Europa can be seen as a reflection of the modern struggle between desire and reason. It suggests that, although transgression can be a legitimate endeavor, it should be tempered by wisdom and experience. As Dante himself said, ask him again in 20 years.
			- Girard proposed the idea that metaphysical desire is a desire to achieve greatness and immortality, to exist in a large capacity and deny death. This drive to be powerful, which he saw in famous people like Clausewitz and Napoleon, was also similar to Nietzsche's will to power. He considered this fundamental ontological yearning to be something that should be renounced, unlike Nietzsche, who believed that it should be embraced.
			- The idea of metaphysical desire raises a few objections. It is not the psychology of everyone, and it may be seen as a negative ambition. However, it is important to note that Girard's theories recognize the need for recognition, glory, and a social reality. This is a part of the will to power that should be embraced, according to Nietzsche.
			- Girard's theories explore the idea of power in relationships, and the need to be seen as powerful in the eyes of others. We are driven by the need to be famous and to have people recognize us, and this is something that we should be aware of. It is important to consider how much influence our desire for greatness and power has on our behaviour, and how this can potentially be harnessed for good.
			- [[Nietzsche]] wrote in his essay *The Uses and Abuses of History For Life* that if one wants to do something of world-historical importance, they must be motivated by a false belief or a "delusional self-aggrandizing prideful desire". He noted that successful entrepreneurs are often driven by a false promise of happiness and an inflated sense of importance of what they are building. [[@nietzsche]] believed that only by being motivated by this untruth and delusion can one achieve great and world-historical activity.
			- This concept of untruth and [[delusion]] can be applied beyond the sphere of [[entrepreneurship]]. All great world-historical activity needs to be motivated from a place of untruth and delusion, as it allows for a distorted truth to be used for our own ends and actions. By being motivated by this delusion, people are able to do great things in the world.
			- The prestigious avenues have too many people, so the only way to succeed is to not focus too much on them and instead pursue an avenue that may seem unfruitful in the beginning, but will yield greater rewards.
			- [[Nietzsche]] had an idea called '[[amor fati]]', which means 'love your fate'. This means to accept whatever life throws at you, even if it's not good. It was part of his idea of the '[[Ubermensch]]', which was about striving to be better.
			- The idea of introspection means thinking deeply about yourself and understanding why you feel certain ways. People are usually very good at understanding the strengths and weaknesses of other people, but they often struggle to understand their own strengths and weaknesses. Tony de Mello, a priest who became enlightened and was later taken back by the Catholic Church, said that if you want to understand your own weaknesses, look at what bothers you in other people. This led to a theory of trying to stand outside of oneself as applied to economic theory and art, which can help you understand why you feel certain ways.
			- The Mona Lisa is a prime example of memetic theory in action. Despite having no practical value - it cannot be eaten or used for any purpose - it is worth hundreds of millions of dollars or euros due to the collective judgment of human desire and what is deemed valuable.
			- Memetic theory suggests that people can create immense value from their ideas. Most art has no practical value like food or shelter, yet people still find it valuable and it can be worth a lot of money. This concept can be applied to tech companies, finance companies, and art to create value. It is possible to generate wealth from the mind.
			- Girard's philosophy of history is a fascinating and unique perspective, particularly when it is compared to the ideas of German thinkers such as Kant and Hegel. Girard agrees with how history has changed, but his views on how it should be are very different. Philosophers like Gellien have argued that truth, reason, and equality have all improved over time and that we are close to the end of history. This means that certain institutions can still be changed, but the fundamental ideas behind them will remain the same.
			- Girard's view of history is different to this. He believes that truth, reason, and equality have all increased, but this has made the world both better and worse than ever before. This is because it has created the potential for more violence than ever before. This links to Girard's psychology, which may seem strange to modern people, but which can be appreciated. According to Girard, the way people want something (metaphysical desire) is more easily shared between people who think of themselves as equal.
			- When a student in their second year of school sees another student in their third year get a special job, they might feel jealous. They might think that the other student is one year ahead of them. This happens with entrepreneurs too. For example, one 22 year old may have a business that makes 10 million dollars while another 24 year old may have a business that makes 200 million dollars. The 22 year old might think they need more time to reach the same level. This is a way of protecting themselves from feeling bad (a coping mechanism)
			- But when two people in the same year of school get a special job, it can be harder to cope. The person who didn't get the job might think the other person has more money or better resources, but it's easier to think that when they are in the same situation. This is why philosopher Girard thinks that separating people into different categories (like social classes, gender roles, and professions) can be helpful. It can stop people from competing with each other too much. However, the internet has changed things. Now everyone can easily compare themselves to others, and see luxury and wealth that they don't have. This can make people feel like they are competing for the same things, even though not everyone is effectively equal. Girard thinks that this could lead to either love or violence, and he believes that it will end badly.
			- We often think that things are permanent and real, when really they are made up of many parts that are always changing. Buddhism teaches us to recognize that things are not as solid as they seem, and that our ideas of what is real are just labels we give to things.
			- Girard believes that people want to be special and powerful, but according to Buddhists, this is a mistake. This confusion about what is real and what is not is the root of our problems. Buddhists believe that practices like studying and meditating can help people understand that they are not really special or powerful, but this might not work for everyone or the entire world.
	- Here are five books that touch on [[Rene Girard]]'s idea of [[mimetic theory]] or theory of [[desire]], and are not written by Rene Girard himself:
		- "The Scapegoat" by René Girard, edited and introduced by James G. Williams - In this book, Girard examines the idea of the scapegoat as a mechanism for resolving [[social conflict]]. He argues that the scapegoat is a figure that is collectively blamed for the problems of a community, thus providing a means for people to release their pent-up anger and frustration.
		  
		  category:: #books
		- "The Girard Reader" edited by James G. Williams - This book collects a number of Girard's essays and other writings on mimetic theory, including "Deceit, Desire, and the Novel." It provides a comprehensive overview of Girard's ideas on the role of imitation in human desire and violence.
		  
		  category:: books
		- "Imitation and Society: The Persistence of Mimesis in the Aesthetics of Burke, Hogarth, and Kant" by Tom Stern - This book examines the idea of imitation in the work of several major figures in the history of aesthetics, including Edmund Burke, William Hogarth, and Immanuel Kant. Stern argues that Girard's mimetic theory is a useful tool for understanding the role of imitation in the development of these thinkers' theories of the arts.
		  
		  category:: books
		- "The Cry of Tamar: Violence Against Women and the Church's Response" edited by Pamela Cooper-White - This book explores the idea of the scapegoat as it relates to violence against women, drawing on Girard's ideas to provide a theological response to this important issue.
		  
		  category:: books
		- "The Origin of Satan" by Elaine Pagels - In this book, Pagels examines the idea of Satan as a scapegoat figure, drawing on Girard's mimetic theory to provide a new perspective on the evolution of this complex and powerful symbol. She argues that Satan has served as a means of projecting human fears and desires onto an external figure, thus resolving [[social conflict]] and preserving the stability of communities.
