- A discussion between a "[[product manager]]" and a "[[project manager]]" about [[dependencies]] and [[product features]]
	- Project Manager:
	  
	  We need to be sure that all of our dependencies are accounted for before we can release this product. Are there any outstanding dependencies that need to be addressed?
	  
	  Product Manager:
	  
	  There are a few dependencies that we are still working on, but we believe they will be resolved before the product is released. However, there are a few features that are dependent on these dependencies being resolved. If they are not resolved in time, we may need to remove or change these features.
