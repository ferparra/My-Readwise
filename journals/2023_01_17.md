	- The Socratic Paradoxes
		- The Socratic paradoxes were a set of questions and statements used by Socrates to challenge his students and examine the true nature of knowledge. They focused on the idea of what can be known and how it is known, as well as the relationship between #knowledge, #opinion, and #belief. Some of the most famous Socratic paradoxes include the following: “I know nothing except the fact of my ignorance”, “The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing”, and “The unexamined life is not worth living”. These paradoxes have had a lasting impact on philosophy and have been used to guide and inform philosophical discussions for centuries.
	- Socratic Ethics
		- Socratic ethics were largely based on the notion that one should seek wisdom and virtue. He taught that the only true wisdom was moral knowledge and that knowledge could only be achieved through #self-reflection and understanding of one's own #beliefs and #values. He believed that one should strive to do what is right and that no one should act immorally. He also believed in the importance of living a balanced life, with moderation in all things, and that one should always be willing to admit one's mistakes.
	- [[Will Durant]], in his book [[The Story of Philosophy]], wrote that [[Socrates]] was "the first moralist of the #West, the first thinker to see that ethical principles could not be based on #mythology or the #supernatural, but must be firmly grounded in human #nature and human experience." He further argued that [[Socrates]]' #influence on #philosophy was immense, and that his ideas and teachings have had a profound effect on the development of Western thought.
