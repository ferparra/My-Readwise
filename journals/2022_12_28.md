	- [[Bond yields]] and central bank [[interest rates]] are related, but they are not the same thing. Bond yields refer to the return that investors receive on their investments in bonds, which are essentially loans that are made to governments or companies. The yield on a bond is determined by the market and reflects the perceived risk of the bond, as well as the level of competition among investors to buy it.
	- Central bank [[interest rates]], on the other hand, refer to the rates at which central banks lend money to commercial banks. Central banks can use their interest rates as a tool to influence the cost of borrowing money and the level of economic activity in an economy.
	- In general, when central banks raise their [[interest rates]], it can lead to an increase in bond yields. This is because higher central bank interest rates can make it more expensive for commercial banks to borrow money, which can lead to an increase in the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers. This, in turn, can lead to an increase in the #yields on bonds, as investors demand a higher return to compensate for the increased risk of lending money in a higher interest rate environment.
	- However, it's important to note that there can be other factors that influence bond #yields, such as the perceived creditworthiness of the borrower, the overall level of demand for bonds, and the supply of bonds in the market. As a result, the relationship between bond yields and central bank [[interest rates]] can be complex and can vary depending on the specific circumstances
