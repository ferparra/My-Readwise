	- How to search and install for a reasonably stable but recent [[python]] version using the [[pyenv]] command.
		- To search for a stable and recent version of Python using `pyenv`, you can use the `pyenv install --list` command. This will list all available versions of Python that you can install using `pyenv`. To install a specific version, use the `pyenv install` command followed by the version number you want to install. For example, to install the latest stable version of Python 3.9, you would use the following command:
		  `pyenv install 3.9.0`
		- You can also use the `pyenv install` command with the `--latest` flag to install the latest version of Python. For example:
		  `pyenv install --latest`
		- Once you have installed a version of Python using `pyenv`, you can set it as the global version for all of your projects by using the `pyenv global` command followed by the version number. For example:
		  `pyenv global 3.9.0`
		  This will set the global version of Python to the version you specified, and it will be used by default when you run Python commands in your terminal.
		- If you want to install a specific version of Python for a specific project, you can use the `pyenv local` command followed by the version number. This will set the local version of Python for the current project, and it will be used whenever you run Python commands within the project directory.
