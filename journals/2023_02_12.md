	- The Nakedness of [[Death]]
		- The idea that death strips us of all [[material possessions]] and worldly [[power]] is one that has been used throughout the centuries in various philosophical contexts. It is often expressed as the image of [[death]] as a return to nakedness, which serves as a reminder of the ultimate [[insignificance]] of material [[wealth]] and worldly [[power]]. This idea is present in the [[Bible]], in Michel de [[Montaigne]]'s Essays, and in the works of [[Epicurus]]. In this article, we will explore this idea further, discussing how it has been used and why it is still relevant today.
		- One of the most famous references to this idea is in Ecclesiastes 5:15 in the Bible, which states: "As he came from his mother's womb, naked shall he return, to go as he came, and shall take nothing for his labour, which he may carry away in his hand." #quotes This passage reflects the idea that death strips us of all material possessions and worldly power, and that all that remains is our nakedness and vulnerability. [The Bible: Ecclesiastes 5:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+5%3A15&version=NIV)
		- Another philosopher who has used this idea is Michel de [[Montaigne]], who in his Essays writes that death leaves us "naked and bare of all, of our clothes and our riches." #quotes He uses this image to argue that [[death]] should not be feared, since it is inevitable and it is through death that we return to the state in which we were born. [Michel de Montaigne: Essays](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3600/3600-h/3600-h.htm)
		- Similarly, the ancient Greek philosopher [[Epicurus]], who was one of the earliest proponents of the philosophy of [[hedonism]], argued that death should not be feared because it is not something that can be experienced, as the soul ceases to exist at the moment of death. He wrote, "When we exist, death is not; and when death exists, we are not." [Epicurus: On Death](https://www.iep.utm.edu/epideath/)
		- Examples
			- [[Julius Caesar]]: "Even Julius Caesar, the mighty Roman Emperor, was famously assassinated and died a mortal death, despite his immense power and influence. The famous quote, "Et tu, Brute?" (And you, Brutus?) spoken by Caesar as he was being stabbed, underscores the reality that even the most powerful individuals are not immune to death and that their power is ultimately fleeting.
			- [[Alexander the Great]]: "Alexander the Great, who conquered much of the known world and established a vast empire, is said to have died at a young age from a mysterious illness. Despite his military prowess and political power, he was unable to escape death and the impermanence of life.
			- [[Genghis Khan]]: "Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire, was one of the most powerful conquerors in history. Yet, despite his military prowess and political influence, he died from a minor injury sustained during a battle, a reminder that even the most powerful leaders are subject to death and impermanence.
		- In all these cases, the image of death as a return to nakedness is used as a reminder of the ultimate insignificance of material wealth and worldly power, and as a way to encourage people to focus on what is truly important in life. The underlying thesis is that life is transitory and that we should not waste our time pursuing things that will be stripped from us at the moment of death, but instead focus on what is truly meaningful and valuable.
	- [[Impermanence]]: A Path to [[Tranquility]]
		- The idea of [[impermanence]] is a central theme in many philosophical and religious traditions. From [[Buddhist]] teachings to the [[Stoic philosophy]], the notion that everything is subject to change and [[decay]] is a common thread that is present throughout many of these traditions. We will explore how this concept of [[impermanence]] is reflected in the writings of famous writers and philosophers, as well as in the teachings of the ancient Stoics.
		  
		  One of the most famous references to this idea in Buddhist literature can be found in the [[Heart Sutra]], which states: "[[Form]] is [[emptiness]], [[emptiness]] is [[form]]. [[Emptiness]] is not other than [[form]], [[form]] is not other than [[emptiness]]. What is [[form]], that is [[emptiness]], what is [[emptiness]], that is [[form]]." This passage is meant to convey the idea that everything is impermanent and subject to change, and that one must cultivate a sense of detachment from the [[material]] world in order to achieve [[enlightenment]].
		  
		  Another Buddhist text, the [[Diamond Sutra]], also reflects this idea, stating: "All things are like a dream, a phantom, a drop of dew, a flash of lightning. That is how to meditate on them, that is how to observe them." #quotes This passage is meant to encourage individuals to cultivate a sense of detachment from the material world and to recognize the transitory nature of life.
		  
		  Similarly, the ancient Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]] is famous for his doctrine of change, which is often referred to as "the river doctrine." He is quoted as saying, "You cannot step into the same river twice." This statement reflects the idea that change is a constant in the world, and that nothing remains the same for long.
		  
		  These teachings and quotes from famous writers and philosophers all point to the fact that one cannot control outcomes, and that everything is subject to change and impermanence. The underlying message is that one must cultivate a sense of [[detachment]] from the material world and recognize the transitory nature of life in order to find [[peace]] and [[contentment]].
		  
		  The [[Stoics]] were a school of ancient Greek philosophers who believed in the philosophy of stoicism. They taught that the universe is governed by natural law and that everything is subject to change and decay.
		  
		  One of the most famous Stoic philosophers, [[Marcus Aurelius]], wrote in his [[Meditations]], "All things are changing and are bound to change. It is no more possible that one should stop change than that one should stop time." #quotes This passage reflects the Stoic belief in the impermanence of all things and that everything is subject to change and decay.
		  
		  Similarly, the Stoic philosopher Epictetus wrote, "Remember that all things are only of a momentary nature, and have no existence except in the present time." This statement emphasizes the transitory nature of life and the idea that everything is subject to change and decay.
		  
		  The Stoics believed that accepting the impermanence of all things was a necessary step in achieving peace of mind and tranquility. They taught that individuals should strive to be indifferent to external events, and focus instead on cultivating inner virtue and wisdom. By recognizing the transitory nature of life and the inevitability of change, the Stoics believed that individuals could achieve a sense of peace and contentment, even in the face of difficult and challenging circumstances.
		- Examples
			- [[Siddhartha]] (Buddha): Buddha's teachings emphasized the importance of embracing impermanence and accepting the inevitability of change and suffering.
			- [[Marcus Aurelius]]: The Roman Emperor and Stoic philosopher is known for his writings in Meditations, where he reflects on the transitory nature of life and the importance of accepting change and impermanence.
			- [[Yoda]] (Star Wars): The Jedi master in the Star Wars franchise is known for his wise counsel and acceptance of the transience of life, famously saying, "[[Death]] is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force."
		- The teachings of Buddhist literature, ancient Greek philosophers, and the Stoics all point to the same conclusion: life is impermanent and subject to change. Accepting this fact and recognizing the transitory nature of life can help us to cultivate a sense of detachment from the material world, and to find peace and contentment even in the midst of difficult times. What lessons can we learn from these ancient wisdom traditions about how to live a life of purpose and contentment?
