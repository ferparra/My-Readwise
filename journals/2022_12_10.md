	- Philosophers have made many important contributions to the development of modern logic, which has had significant practical applications in fields such as mathematics and computer science. Some of the major contributions of philosophers to the development of modern logic include the following:
		- The development of [[Symbolic Logic]], which is a formal #system for representing logical statements and arguments using symbolic notation. This was first developed by philosophers such as [[George Boole]] and [[Gottlob Frege]], and has been widely used in fields such as mathematics and computer science.
		- The development of formal proof systems, which are methods for formally demonstrating the validity of logical arguments. This was first developed by philosophers such as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and has been widely used in fields such as #mathematics and [[Computer Science]].
		- The development of modal logic, which is a type of logic that deals with concepts such as necessity and possibility. This was first developed by philosophers such as [[Saul Kripke]] and [[David Lewis]], and has been widely used in fields such as computer science and artificial intelligence.
		- The development of [[Decision Theory]], which is a branch of #logic that deals with the formal modeling of decision-making processes. This was first developed by philosophers such as [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]], and has been widely used in fields such as #economics and [[Game Theory]].
		  
		  Overall, the contributions of philosophers to the development of modern logic have had a significant impact on practical applications in fields such as mathematics and computer science.
