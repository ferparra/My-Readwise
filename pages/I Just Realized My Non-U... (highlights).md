	- I just realized my non-US friends probably don't know how US insurance works. 
	  
	  So lets say your employer offers insurance. They pay a portion and then you pay a portion. For a family, the employee pays on average about $400 per pay cycle, or $10,400 per year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/status/1513179369325436935))

	- This does not mean all your medical care is then covered by insurance. Nope, not even close. 
	  
	  Most doctors visits have a co-pay, meaning you pay this to even be seen. It's anywhere from $20 to $200 depending on emergencies. 
	  
	  Insurance also requires you to pay a deductible... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/status/1513179371707711488))
	- before they kick in. So let's say your deductible is $1000. That means for each visit, you owe $1000 before they start covering. 
	  
	  But they "negotiate" with hospitals, so an MRI out of pocket might cost $5000, but through insurance only costs $400, so you pay $400. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/status/1513179374090170368))
	- After awhile, there is a "max out of pocket" which means you pay $20,000 out of pocket for all these little visits and then insurance will cover anything further 100% for the year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/status/1513179377307197453))
	- Oh, but insurance doesn't cover EVERYTHING. They agree to certain exclusions... like maybe they don't cover an ambulance ride or only partially cover major dental. Oh and they typically don't cover regular dental or eye care at all (that's a different insurance you buy). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/status/1513179381077790720))
	- And the insurance only negotiates with certain doctors and clinics... so if you don't use them they only cover your care 50% instead of 80% and the deductibles are higher. 
	  
	  But, if you get hospitalized, the insurance might cover the facility and nurses, but the doctors can be... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/status/1513179382541606913))
	- out of network, so you have to pay more without any say in the matter. And medical facilties, even ERs, can just choose not to take any insurance. It isn't a requirement they take it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/status/1513179384739418116))
	- Now for prescriptions and treatments. So, let's say you do everything right. You use all in-network doctors and facilities, pay your money, so you should be good?
	  
	  Nope. 
	  
	  Insurance companies can step in and dictate your care. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/status/1513179387172114437))
	- So let's say you bang up your knee and need an MRI plus surgery. The doctor agrees and you agree, but the insurance company says "No, you need physical therapy first." So in order to have the MRI plus surgery covered, you now need to go through months of physical therapy... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/status/1513179388422012933))
	- before it will be approved. You could always just pay outside of insurance, but now you are paying $12k of your money instead of $3k and months of pain. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/status/1513179389789450241))
	- There are plenty of other caveats too that I didn't even cover. 
	  
	  So basically, you can have medical insurance, get into a major accident, and still go bankrupt because I don't know many people with $40k just lying around. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/status/1513179391160901634))
	- But politicians and insurance lobbyists keep telling us we should be GRATEFUL to only have to pay that $40k instead of hundreds of thousands of dollars!
	  
	  And remember, even if you are perfectly healthy and need just a checkup, you are paying $10,400 every year anyway. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/status/1513179392972926985))
	- Medical insurance in the US is a BILLION DOLLAR PROFIT INDUSTRY.  It is also complete and utter garbage. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/status/1513179394289905669))
	- Oh and keep in mind.... NONE of this is taught in schools or anywhere. This is knowledge I've gained completely on my own. And this barely scratches the surface of how complicated this system is. 
	  
	  You think the majority of Americans understand how insurance works? https://t.co/Eo3J9IGYjC ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/status/1513183572861014017))
	- I like how there isn't any arguing in this giant thread. Just people coming together with angry and sad resignations that the US health insurance system is a giant trash fire. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/status/1513361956236894214))
