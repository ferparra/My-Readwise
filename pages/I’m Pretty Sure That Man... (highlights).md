	- I’m pretty sure that many (most?) people who think React’s programming model is simpler than signals has not built anything serious with modern signals.
	  
	  In my experience, the more you use them, esp as your app scales, the more their DX shines
	  
	  Signals are not just about perf

	- I know none of us are rich on time - but I’d really encourage anyone who is debating the philosophical merits of both to just try both
	  
	  Or at least pay attention to the POV of those who have actually used both, esp in non trivial applications, like @thdxr

	- This is a good thread for those who want to dig in more on the tradeoffs between @reactjs vs @solid_js from someone who has used both in depth
	  
	  Read the replies to see them asked some gold and relevant questions and giving (imo) very balanced answers
