	- Fun question from my investments class: the efficient markets hypothesis says (roughly) that stock prices can't be predictable. But short-term interest rates are very predictable. Why does efficient markets make stock prices unpredictable, but not interest rates? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnthonyLeeZhang/status/1625575241803259904))

	- I'd disagree with all answers so far. Here's a hint. Which of the following commodities have more predictable prices, and why?
	- There is a very sharp answer to this question, which everyone is missing so far! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnthonyLeeZhang/status/1625579820955607040))
	- This is it!
	  
	  Slightly longer version: stock prices are not predictable because of intertemporal arbitrage. If you think a stock is going to be more expensive tomorrow, you buy it, hold it, and sell it. This costs you essentially nothing.

	- Intertemporal arbitrage works for durable goods that are not costly to store (or short). Gold is the closest physical example. Gold costs nearly nothing to store relative to its value, so gold prices can't be systematically predictable, or people would do the storage arb ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnthonyLeeZhang/status/1625581304451588096))
	- Oil is somewhat more expensive to store, so oil prices are somewhat more predictable than gold. Electricity is in principle storable but in practice extremely costly - thus, electricity prices are higher in daytime than nighttime, and there's nothing you can do about it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnthonyLeeZhang/status/1625581460236402688))
	- The extreme case is rental contracts, like hotel reservations, which by definition are impossible to store! A hotel reservation for tonight and for tomorrow night are different goods - one is not a substitute for the other (especially on Valentine's day...) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnthonyLeeZhang/status/1625581625550708736))
	- So hotel reservations can be predictably higher on Feb 14 than feb 13, and there's nothing you can do about it on Feb 12. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnthonyLeeZhang/status/1625581699810856960))
	- How does this relate to interest rates? Short-term interest rates are just rental contracts for money! Money can be predictably cheaper to rent a year later than today, and since renting money today can't be turned into renting money tomorrow, there's nothing you can do about it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnthonyLeeZhang/status/1625581842945687552))
