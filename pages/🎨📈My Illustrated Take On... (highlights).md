	- 2/ Choosing your metrics 
	  
	  You‚Äôll want to consider a few different categories that cover multiple granularities and perspectives that will help you make rigorous product decisions. https://t.co/s2kKvM3aJq ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewcyu/status/1384122579015770114))
	- 3/ Health metrics 
	  
	  It‚Äôs vital that your team understands how well the product is performing, and is aware of potential issues. https://t.co/lRIhpq6xXh ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewcyu/status/1384122585844125696))
	- 4/ Usage metrics
	  
	  The success of a product largely depends on how users engage with it, as well as how often (and if) they come back for more. Usage metrics should almost always be among the most vital inputs for product decisions. https://t.co/r7hXzW2RUd ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewcyu/status/1384122591426736138))
	- 5/ Adoption metrics
	  
	  Gives you a view into the user experience, but from a different perspective than usage metrics. They focus on how your users adopt the product and how they react to a new feature or service. https://t.co/Lf9LAKhV9A ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewcyu/status/1384122597604950020))

	- 6/ Satisfaction metrics
	  
	  Satisfied customers are most likely to spread the word about your product. Customer satisfaction impacts not only your other key metrics but also your company‚Äôs brand. https://t.co/kdtl3w9vjY ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewcyu/status/1384122603229433857))

	- 7/ Ecosystem metrics
	  
	  A product doesn‚Äôt operate in isolation. Tracking a product‚Äôs position within its macro-environment can help teams keep their eyes on bigger opportunities and long-term planning. https://t.co/mKzdjPvhQe ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewcyu/status/1384122608807923718))
	- 8/ Outcome metrics
	  
	  For some companies, the product is the business. For others, it delivers business results. https://t.co/ILkVBMV4xF ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewcyu/status/1384122614457651202))
	- 9/ Refining your metrics 
	  
	  After choosing your suite of metrics, focus on a small set, your key metrics (KMs) and leading indicator metrics (LMs). https://t.co/cRyJgns7nM ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewcyu/status/1384122620149309449))

	- 10/ Key metrics
	  
	  At the highest level, a company typically chooses a north star metric that‚Äôs responsive to product changes, and is a holistic representation of the product‚Äôs value for users. https://t.co/q0RaYruUeL ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewcyu/status/1384122626621141004))

	- 11/ Leading metrics
	  
	  KMs can often be lagging indicators of work done, that‚Äôs why you also need a small set of leading indicator metrics. Leading Metrics (LMs) might change more frequently than KMs. https://t.co/tL7xnBrbAv ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewcyu/status/1384122632841293825))

	- 12/ Tracking your metrics
	  
	  1. Treat your metrics dashboard like a product
	  2. Actually track its usage (meta!)
	  3. Set a Chrome pinned tab for the dash
	  4. Review pinned tab every N days (e.g. every morning)
	  5. Set a weekly email report (some folks love emailed metrics e.g. execs) https://t.co/witmlQ6R1t ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewcyu/status/1384122638545526792))
