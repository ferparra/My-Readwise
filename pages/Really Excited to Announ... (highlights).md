	- Really excited to announce a big update for the @logseq @openai #gpt3 plugin!
	  
	  A UI popup that lets you use "prompt templates" or write freeform text as the prompt.
	  
	  You can ask the AI to perform any task on the current block, use a built-in command, or define your own templates https://t.co/fpU2CcCGyg ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Bsunter/status/1614022906866176001))

	- You can write any command in the popup, and it will run that command using text in the current block. 
	  
	  For example, to create flash cards for studying, you could write "create flash cards based on the following text:" https://t.co/BHpr7vVXdE ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Bsunter/status/1614022910775275520))
	- There are also a bunch of built-in prompts for common tasks like summarization, creating outlines, asking follow-up questions, and identifying common objections to an idea. https://t.co/x7nDXG5aBk ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Bsunter/status/1614022914332033024))
	- You can also define custom prompts templates anywhere in your notes, similar to the built-in @logseq templates
	  
	  Just make a header with a "prompt-template:: Prompt Name" property, and a 
	  ```prompt 
	  My custom prompt:
	  ```
	  code block under it. 
	  It will appear in the popup dropdown https://t.co/SpibEVCA1q ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Bsunter/status/1614022917909794816))
	- The popup shows you a preview of the output before you insert it into your notes. 
	  
	  Sometimes the first try doesn't generate optimal results, so you can click "Regenerate" to re-run the prompt until you get something good. https://t.co/sK6SQ69oSO ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Bsunter/status/1614022921504305154))
	- You can click "Insert" or hit enter to add the output underneath the current block
	  
	  You can also click "Replace" to replace the current block with the output. This is useful for improving the tone of existing writing, fixing grammar/spelling, and translation. https://t.co/6jWRi79PfN ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Bsunter/status/1614022925333729280))
	- Do you have a prompt that the community would find useful? Contribute it to the built-in prompts list 
	  
	  There's a TOML text file in the repo where you can add them. I encourage you to be creative and I'm especially interested in @logseq - specific prompts
