	- @OpenAI 2/ In this short, 1.5 hour course, @isafulf and I teach how you can build applications quickly using large language models (LLMs), and best practices for doing so. Thank you Isa and the @OpenAI team for collaborating on this exciting course. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg/status/1651605901781110785))
	- @OpenAI @isafulf 3/ Until now, there has been relatively little material on best practices for developers wanting to build applications using API access to LLMs (as opposed to how to prompt the web UI). Weâ€™re excited to change that. I hope you enjoy the course! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg/status/1651606376161103872))
