	- Meaningful value accrual - if our protocol creates and captures value, it needs to be directed to those token holders, who are actively participating to the success of the protocol (no freeriders)
	- Main advantages of LBPs over the Uniswap listing is a choice of various ratios that do not restrain us to 50:50. It also offers additional programmability e.g. falling initial price with continuous sell pressure from smart contracts that prevents furious front-running by bots and whales leading to insane price pumps and suboptimal distribution.
