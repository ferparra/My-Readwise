	- I'm not aware of anyone with an authoritative voice in #DDDesign who sells it as "the only way." Even so, there are at least two vital considerations for determining a problem-solving approach to software design:

	- 1. Software developers are notoriously weak at recognizing complexity. How many times have we heard, "That's so simple"? Engineers tend to make judgments by surveying candidate using cases that are common, already well understood, and that are indeed simple, in order to
