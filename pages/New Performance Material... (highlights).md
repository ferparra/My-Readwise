	- Performance focused biomaterials like spider silk protein are scaling up at historic speeds, yet are not being talked about.
	  
	  Since 2008, spider silk protein production has almost doubled every six months‚ÄºÔ∏è 
	  
	  Spiber‚Äôs 20 mg in three months in 2008 and today‚Äôs pilot-scale plant:

	- This growth is not slowing.
	  
	  Leading producers AMSilk and Spiber can‚Äôt make enough spider silk protein to serve soaring demand. 
	  
	  In the coming years, they are aggressively scaling production to over ten thousand tons per year combined. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322851636355072))
	- In comparison, the global production volume of 3D printed polymers is projected to be 27,000 tons in 2023. 
	  
	  Spider silk protein volume could surpass this in a few years, while scaling more than an order of magnitude faster. 
	  
	  Five years ago, who would have predicted this? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322852819238913))
	- Mycelium is another biomaterial that‚Äôs rapidly scaling production. 
	  
	  2007: @ebenbayer made pound-scale biscuit-sized pieces.
	  
	  2021: Ecovative produced 45 tons that year.
	  
	  2024: New AirMycelium farm aims for 13,000 tons of mycelium bacon capacity.

	- The synbio ‚Äústack‚Äù is enabling startups to be faster, better and cheaper.
	  
	  DNA sequencing and synthesis costs have tumbled orders of magnitude. See @rob_carlson‚Äôs curves below. 
	  
	  Improvements have also happened at all levels of the synbio stack.

	- Strain engineering allows thousands of variants to be tested in days. 
	  
	  Metabolic engineering has helped enable dramatic improvements in molecule titers. 
	  
	  Software, cloud services, automation and robotics are making it faster and cheaper to run experiments. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322861702795269))
	- The improving stack helped reduce development times for Amyris and Geno‚Äôs molecules several fold.
	  
	  Meanwhile Lanzatech‚Äôs first-generation ethanol is cost competitive today. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322862965264384))
	- Performance biomaterials have novel properties that surpass existing materials, even in this first generation.
	  
	  What are some examples of these materials? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322864059883520))
	- Spider silk protein made by AMSilk or Spiber is lightweight, very tough and elastic and has high tensile strength.
	  
	  It‚Äôs already commercialized in apparel, watch straps and medtech. Airbus is testing it to replace carbon fiber in airplane composite parts.

	- @Checkerspot makes algal oil polyurethanes with excellent damping and low-temperature tensile strength. This is perfect in skis and snowboards from their own WNDR Alpine brand.
	  
	  They are also exploring partnerships with automotive, apparel and cosmetics companies.

	- Squid-inspired protein can heal to full strength in seconds, orders of magnitude better than state of the art materials. Demo in video below is from a Nature paper. 
	  
	  The paper also demonstrated it can even be used as a soft pneumatic actuator for robots. https://t.co/Sh0cajuLPj ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322918162219012))
	- The startup Tandem Repeat is commercializing a squid-inspired protein for textile adhesives and fabrics, with more markets to come. 
	  
	  Over time, performance biomaterials will become even better. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322920565653505))
	- Fermentation and material fabrication processes can be tuned. 
	  
	  Better strains will be developed. Better suited microbial chassis engineered. Gas feedstocks made viable. Cell-free catalysis pathways will mature. 
	  
	  Outside of synbio, there‚Äôs other notable emerging materials. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322921580662784))
	- One is graphene, which has been quietly finding uses in more niche markets. Global production soared to 12,000 tons last year, at a speedy 61% CAGR over three years. 
	  
	  Like spider silk protein, it might overtake the volume of 3D printed polymers in the next few years. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322922700464128))
	- What about costs? 
	  
	  Rapid scale-up will allow biomaterials like spider silk protein to continue coming down the cost curve. 
	  
	  As volume scales, spider silk protein may become more cost effective than premium textiles and existing functional materials. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322923883257858))
	- As spider silk protein approaches thousands of tons per year, it can reach price points of cashmere, then silk and even premium wools.
	  
	  At $80-$90/kg (less than cashmere but more than silk), it hits cost parity with aerospace-grade carbon fiber. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322925091299330))
	- How will startups use these materials?
	  
	  Today, most performance biomaterials producers partner with incumbent brands.
	  
	  That‚Äôs fine. But I think to get people more excited about products with these novel materials, I think consumer product startups will play a key role. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322926257209345))
	- Incumbents did not build the iPhone, the Tesla Roadster, the original Fitbit or even the Allbirds Wool Runners. 
	  
	  The upstarts will push the boundaries more than any established players. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322927406555136))
	- Consumer product startups can offer more differentiated products, free of incumbent constraints. 
	  
	  They can move faster and develop deep expertise in materials science and integration. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322928555696133))
	- They can see beyond existing product categories into new form factors and designs that do not exist today. Designs that would not be viable for incumbents.
	  
	  Performance materials will free up product design constraints. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322929604370438))
	- Over time, I see these next-gen materials being integrated into more complex products. 
	  
	  They could one day become common in self-repairing smart clothing, biocompatible human-computer interfaces, electric aircraft and other vehicles and humanoid robots. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1565322930875252736))
	- Materials innovation at scale is happening for the first time in many decades. It‚Äôs an exciting time to build.
