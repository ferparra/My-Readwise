	- I added the @sama episode to Lex-GPT (a Q+A assistant w/ ChatGPT over all 367 episodes of the @lexfridman podcast). It uses @OpenAI whisper for audio -> text, @pinecone for text embeddings, and @LangChainAI.

	- @sama makes an interesting point in the pod: "I suspect that too much of the processing power during training goes into using the model as a database rather than a reasoning engine." ... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RLanceMartin/status/1640025309650227200))
	- ... a lot of cool work in the open source world has focused on using these models as reasoning engines over *only* your data (e.g., papers) or a specific pod / blog. @andrewwhite01 paper-qa and @mckaywrigley's great work inspired me on this theme:  https://t.co/DYueZn4uRY ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RLanceMartin/status/1640025311030173696))
	- ... relatedly, @mayowaoshin has a great tutorial on chat Q+A over any PDF, showing you can chat w/ a famous supreme court case (Morse v. Frederick):

	- ... it's awesome to now see @OpenAI retrieval plug-in enabling this use case c/o @isafulf: https://t.co/yDh28zjc9o ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RLanceMartin/status/1640025315752935431))
	- ... we'll probably see this general theme grow to encompass most content (text, audio, visual) w/ many domain-specific applications: https://t.co/OEdbru8ZhW ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RLanceMartin/status/1640025317900419073))
	- I'm working on cataloging pain points (feedback welcome) and testing on larger datasets, such as the > 600 episodes corpus of @tferriss pods. https://t.co/0StdDTkUBq ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RLanceMartin/status/1640025320043745280))
