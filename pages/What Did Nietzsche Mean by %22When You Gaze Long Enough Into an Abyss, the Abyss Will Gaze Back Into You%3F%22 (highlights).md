- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Jan 26th, 2023]]
	- Nietzsche is cautioning us to understand the relationship between ourselves and our pursuits ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp3z587penrqs1v8czwsm04))
	- we may accidentally become like the thing we seek to destroy in one way or another ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp3zgam1c40f2h4y0vyj1y3))
	- The bit about the abyss is different in two respects. First, that it is about *gazing* rather than *fighting*. So, Nietzsche is maybe here trying to remind us (as he does frequently) that contemplating is just as active and transformative as "fighting." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp416q2d9qvvtn2v12c2k09))
	- There is a dialectic in *Zarathurstra* about going down (into / toward the abyss) in order to go up/over (to the summit). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp41t7tzwtqv8dwbypsr6xm))
	- in *Gay Science* 284 about, speculatively, what a person would glimpse if they saw into the bottom of themselves. The implication there seems to be that it would not be something that one would want to see. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp42mwhjmmwhm9arpt0g4pq))
	- 'Fighting with a monster' contrasts 'gazing into an abyss,' where the former suggests an activity *with others* and the latter an activity *by yourself*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp44ggmatasjt0962a9hcth))
