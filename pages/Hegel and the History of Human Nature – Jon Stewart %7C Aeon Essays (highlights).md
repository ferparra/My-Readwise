	- associated with the German philosopher G W F Hegel (1770-1831). He rejects the claim of the first view, that of the essentialists, since he doesn’t think that human nature is something given or created once and for all
	- at the beginning of human history, people didn’t conceive of themselves as individuals in the same way that we do today
	- the ancients conceived of themselves primarily as belonging to a larger group: the family, the tribe, the state, etc
	- Today, most of us feel strongly that we have the right to make the important decisions concerning our lives as individual
	- While this idea is entirely intuitive to us today, it’s not absolute but rather socially and historically conditioned
	- Socrates is thought to have initiated a revolution in thinking with regard to the subjectivity of the individual
	- nothing should be accepted merely because it has been passed down by tradition
	- individuals have the obligation to examine any truth claim with their own critical reason, and only when it passes that test can it be accepted
	- not the action in the world but the inward disposition of the individual
	- here is a harmony of the individual in his or her role as family member, citizen and so on. In this picture, individuals are like children who aren’t yet fully mature or able to make rational decisions on their own. They aren’t yet fully free. Modernity is characterised by a sense of alienation that leads to rebellion and disharmony. The individual feels compelled to assert him- or herself against the family, the school, the state or other larger institutions. This is the mindset of the Romantics in Hegel’s day – and of our own times.
