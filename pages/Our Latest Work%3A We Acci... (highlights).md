	- Our latest work: We accidentally found a way to elongate lysosomes into filamentous tubules! “Lysosomes can look like mitochondria?”, you may ask. Yup, stick with me and let me surprise you…. 1/n

	- @BhavyaJay  wanted to send DNA devices to the ER. She used an aptamer that, according to lit, was supposed to localize in the ER. 1 year in, she found that instead of marking tubular ER regions as she initially surmised, it was actually in highly tubular lysosomes!  2/n ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KrishnanYamuna/status/1441507943610994688))
	- Lysosomes are generally spherical, but become tubular when cells are either inflamed or starved. They get stretched along microtubules: a process conserved across phyla. But why use this tubular form? How does tubulation change the lysosomal milieu?  3/n

	- Briefly: although enzymatic content b/w both forms are similar, tubular lysosomes are less degradative. We know that when you activate immune cells, proteolysis increases. We found that this increase happens only in vesicular lysosomes. 4/n

	- Intrigued, @anandsami999  and @BhavyaJay  mapped Ca2+ and pH in both kinds of lysosomes. While overall pH and Ca2+ in tubular and vesicular lysosomes were similar, they found something very cool! 5/n ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KrishnanYamuna/status/1441507953073442817))
	- There was a Ca2+ gradient all along tubular lysosomes – every tubule had a high Ca2+ end and a low Ca2+ end. There was even a pH gradient in the opposite direction. Regions of high Ca2+ also had high pH and those with low Ca2+ had low pH. 6/n

	- Both ion gradients were dynamic, changing as tubules grew and retracted. Given the players involved in tubulation @Botelho_Lab  had earlier predicted that, there must be a Ca2+ gradient inside tubules – but there was no proof. Till now. 7/n

	- When @BhavyaJay  first showed me these gradients I assumed it was an imaging artifact. @anandsami999  and she did some beautiful experiments showing that the gradients were real. We later dug up @Botelho_Lab 's prediction and became all excited! 8/n ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KrishnanYamuna/status/1441507968034369538))
	- We found 2 or 3 other new things using Tudor: our DNA-based tubular-lysosome-inducer. MMP9 was a new player in the signaling pathway, tubulation aided the early stages of phagocytosis and helped phagosome-lysosome fusion. 9/n ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KrishnanYamuna/status/1441507969389273090))
	- Tudor does not activate either autophagy or inflammation. So you can now study tubular lysosomes in resting cells without activating the transcription programs for inflammation or autophagy, which change lysosomal gene expression. 10/n ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KrishnanYamuna/status/1441507970613796864))
	- @deeyakc  set up key assays, @PurrChangC of the incredible @LevBecker lab isolated every imaginable kind of macrophage, @matttzajac swooped in and hauled the story across the finish line with MMP9 assays when COVID tragedies took @BhavyaJay back to India. 11/n ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KrishnanYamuna/status/1441507972266430472))
	- This was one of my favorite papers from our lab. So I was disheartened when it was rejected same day as submitted to @eLife - editor stated 3 reasons: 2 were wrong and 1 showed they hadn’t read the paper. 12/n

	- Felt sad, quickly recovered, didn’t appeal (bias was clear, so no point wasting time). We submitted elsewhere, were lucky that a more accomplished lysosome biologist found it interesting, and we got uplifting reviews! 13/n

	- What I learnt: if editor is unlikely to consider a 180 viewpoint, move on fast. Time and energy are more valuable. Your message needs to get out, doesn’t matter where. The end.
