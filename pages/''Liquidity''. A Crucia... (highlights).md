	- ''Liquidity''.
	  
	  A crucial and widely misunderstood driver of financial markets.
	  
	  Let's explain what liquidity really means, and where it's headed next.
	  
	  A thread.

	- The Fed intends to drain ‘’liquidity’’ at a rapid pace in 2023.
	  
	  And while the pace might be more friendly for the next months, don’t get distracted.
	  
	  Banks, the repo market and Wall Street will soon start feeling the heat.

	- Let's first explain what ‘‘liquidity’’ really is in plain English
	  
	  Let’s start with the basics: ‘’liquidity’’ = bank reserves
	  
	  It’s one line item you can easily track on the FRED database (Fed balance sheet - liabilities), and you don’t need any fancy formula to calculate it

	- Bank reserves are money for banks.
	  
	  Banks use reserves to transact with each other and with the Fed: to settle transactions, buy bonds (!) from each other, and lubricate the biggest funding mechanism in the world – the repo market.
	  
	  Why does ''liquidity'' matter?

	- No, I will not draw a line chart of ‘’liquidity’’ versus the S&P500 and tell you that is the magic formula.
	  
	  Because that’s macro gaslighting, or aka bull…. :)
	  
	  Banks don’t use reserves to buy stocks because equities are not a regulatory well-treated asset (HQLA).

	- But yes, the amount and the rate of change of bank reserves matter for repo markets and risk appetite.
	  
	  A regime of ample reserves helps banks in providing liquidity to financial markets.
	  
	  Here is how it works.
	  
	  6/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1618313568264548352))
	- In that regime, banks will facilitate a smooth functioning of the repo market and have appetite for absorbing high-quality bonds (Treasuries, high-rated corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities etc).
	  
	  As repo markets work smoothly and banks bid high-quality bonds...

	- ...investors tend to take more risks.
	  
	  In 2023 though, we are looking at the exact opposite.
	  
	  The Fed is draining ''liquidity'' from markets and over time that leads investors’ risk appetite to fade.
	  
	  Less reserves => wider credit spreads.

	- And in 2023, a lot will be going on with bank reserves.
	  
	  How?
	  
	  Let’s start with the elephant in the room: Quantitative Tightening.

	- In its simplest form, QT shrinks the balance sheet of the Fed on the asset side (bonds not reinvested) and on the liability side – here, the standard is that bank reserves are destroyed.
	  
	  As the government keeps issuing bonds over time, it’s up to the private sector...
	  
	  10/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1618313577420705792))
	- ...to absorb bond issuance.
	  
	  Reserves are destroyed, and private investors have less room to allocate towards riskier assets.
	  
	  The Fed will be running QT at a yearly pace of > $1 trillion.
	  
	  So, does this mean reserves are going to linearly shrink by $95 billion per month?

	- Not really
	  
	  Other factors like the Treasury General Account (TGA) or the Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) impact US liquidity
	  
	  Understanding ‘‘liquidity’’ is crucial to navigate markets
	  
	  I just released a piece on The Macro Compass that helps you digesting these monetary dynamics
