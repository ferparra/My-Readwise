	- Bounded Context is a central pattern in Domain-Driven Design. It
	  is the focus of DDD's strategic design section which is all about
	  dealing with large models and teams.
	- A model acts as a UbiquitousLanguage to help communication
	  between software developers and domain experts.
	- design of the software itself - how
	  it's broken down into objects or functions.
	- Bounded Contexts have both unrelated concepts (such as a support
	  ticket only existing in a customer support context) but also share
	  concepts (such as products and customers).

	- find multiple contexts within the same domain context, such
