	- Bootstrapping a software company is the best way to build wealth.
	  
	  Jason Cohen has bootstrapped 4 software companies from 0 to $1+ million in revenue.
	  
	  Two are now worth $1+ billion.
	  
	  Here's his exact plan to self-fund startups: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ColinKeeley/status/1624816328174628864))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- The Goal
	  
	  Build a self-funded business that predictably gives you $10,000 per month.
	  
	  We aren't trying to change the world.
	  
	  Just build a business that funds your lifestyle and is fun to work on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ColinKeeley/status/1624816330825428993))
	- Three areas to focus on to hit our goal:
	- Revenue
	  
	  To hit $10,000 per month you need 150 customers paying you ~$67 each per month.
	  
	  Recurring revenue is the only reliable way to hit this target. Then you only have a acquire a customer once.
	  
	  Acquiring customers doesn't get easier. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ColinKeeley/status/1624816335921479682))
	- First 50 Customers: Scratch & Claw
	  
	  For WPEngine he reached out to WordPress consultants (his target customers) on Linkedin and offered to pay whatever they wanted to look at his product and tell him what they think.
	  
	  No one asked to be paid. Many put money down pre-product. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ColinKeeley/status/1624816338496790530))
	- Next 100 Customers
	  
	  Ignore social media and blogging. Focus on ads.
	  
	  Jason's blog had 40k readers. He tried to sell his blogging software to them and got 2 customers from it.
	  
	  Ads are repeatable: Spend X dollars on ads. Get Y dollars in revenue. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ColinKeeley/status/1624816341155975174))
	- Be a Boutique
	  
	  You aren't a huge company. Lean into that.
	- Cash is King
	  
	  Do annual prepay for two months free so you can spend that money right now on growing your business.
	  
	  You can make annual prepay even more enticing by upping the monthly costs and giving 50% off for annual.
	  
	  Give bloggers coupons for three months off to grow. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ColinKeeley/status/1624816346428219394))
	- Charge More
	  
	  ARPU (average revenue per user) is the most important metric for small SaaS businesses.
	  
	  Basic 3 pricing tiers: $49 / $99 / $249 and highlight the middle one. Call the most expensive one the “Business” tier.
	  
	  Raise prices. Do it again. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ColinKeeley/status/1624816349024522240))
	- No Free Trial
	  
	  Do a 60-day money-back guarantee instead of a free trial.
	  
	  Converts better. No one uses it and you get the money upfront.
	  
	  Here's a graph of the number of customers after WP Engine changed from a 14-day free trial to a 60-day money-back guarantee.

	- Bad Markets
	  
	  Never sell to consumers. They don’t spend money. Hard to get someone to pay $1 for a mobile app.
	  
	  Avoid temporary pain / point-in-time. Ex weddings, events. Not recurring.
	  
	  Avoid marketplaces - You have to build two businesses. Need sellers and consumers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ColinKeeley/status/1624816364346298369))
	- Good Markets
	  
	  Naturally recurring. Ex: anything tied to financial cycles (invoicing, taxes, reporting, admin, HR). They have to pay for it.
	  
	  Pain that changes over time: Ex: SEO, PPC, email marketing, support ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ColinKeeley/status/1624816366955163648))
	- Good Markets (cont)
	  
	  Not real-time. Ex: analytics, metrics, finance (ex invoicing), project management, content.
	  
	  Something that can be finished. Avoid competing on features.
	  
	  Add-ons. Anything attached to an established product such as Shopify or WordPress. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ColinKeeley/status/1624816369584988160))
	- Good Markets (cont)
	  
	  Go for big markets with multiple niches.
	  
	  This means that people actually want the product already. Demand is validated.
	  
	  Find your niche and then expand. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ColinKeeley/status/1624816372202233857))
	- TLDR on a Self-Funded Business
	  
	  Revenue: get 150 customers paying $67+ per month
	  
	  Market: choose a big market. Build a product that people need and is naturally recurring.
	  
	  Customer Acquisition: Focus on ads over content. With annual pre-pay it creates a cash machine. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ColinKeeley/status/1624816374844653568))
