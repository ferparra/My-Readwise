		- **Note**: Thread
	- With this integration you can now use this model as you would any other
	  
	  Per @gdb the ChatGPT model is 10% the cost of GPT3 and is highly performant at most tasks, not just chat
	  
	  In addition to a similar interface as existing OpenAI wrapper, you can also specify "prefix messages"

	- Of course, with this being a chat model there's lots of additional chat functionality to explore
	  
	  More integrations to take full advantage of the chat based api coming soon ðŸ‘€
