	- You want to avoid burying knowledge in large notes as it makes it hard to glance at and link to other notes in a concise way.
	- Notes are linked to other notes which support your ideas. This also help the discovery of new ideas.
	- You use your slip box to help you do your thinking. You want to ask it questions, find the related notes that support/oppose the arguments and find gaps or newly related information.
	- You can create index notes that help you find your way around.
	- Part of the process is to help your understanding by writing. With a well maintained slip box, you'll never be starting from a blank sheet. You decide what insight/question/knowledge you want to explore, and pull together the notes that give you the body of research to get you started. You shouldn't need to start a new blog post by researching, that happens prior by taking smart notes as you naturally read what you're interested in.
