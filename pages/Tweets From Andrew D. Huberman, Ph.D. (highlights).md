	- Heart Rate Variability• 
	  _
	  Inhale= diaphragm moves down= heart volume increases= sinoatrialnode signals brain = brain signals heart to speed up. 
	  _
	  Exhale= diaphragm moves up= heart volume decreases= sinoatrialnode signals brain= brain signals heart to slow down. ...Basically. https://t.co/nk7ByR3wjn ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1367675030373425152))
	- One of the best things to happen to neuroscience in the last 10 years is the influx of people not only from biology, physiology and psychology but also physics, engineering, computer science, nutrition, animal behavior, economics... and on and on. The field is evolving fast. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1401328930431275009))
	- The hallmark of a (good) scientist is that, when they see something that excites them, they slow down. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1402764967770673152))
	- That vagus nerve stimulation can trigger increased alertness and anxiety, not just calming (as is commonly believed) should not surprise anyone. Gut feelings are often that of fear, anxiety, or nausea and less often of pleasure. Vagus nerve controls “yum”, “yuck” & “meh”.

	- Understanding (even a small bit about) mechanism adds power and flexibility to a health-related protocol. When one understands a bit about why something works, they can adjust timing, dose etc in a meaningful & impactful  way. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1416868589898895362))
	- Understand “reward prediction error” & you will never reply to a negative comment again. Negative comments open a dopamine anticipation loop (in the commenter). Respond and the circuit closes; they get rewarded. Don’t respond & their dopamine will eventually drop below baseline. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1423710313103253505))
	- The data are clear: for brain & body health we should all get ~150-180min of zone 2 (mellow-ish) cardio, & 5-10 sets of resistance exercise per muscle group, per week. Intensity level of sets adjusts that +/- 4 sets. Sleep, nutrition & hormone status impact recovery. #basics ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1426203489890226186))
	- Getting sleep right:
	  1.Sunlight exposure w/in 30m of waking for 10-30m
	  2. Avoid bright light (all colors) 10pm-4am
	  3. *If safe for you*: Mg Threonate (~140mg), Theanine (100-300mg), Apigenin (50mg) 30-45m prior to sleep
	  4. Keep the room cool
	  5. No caffeine post 2pm
	  6. No alcohol ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1428823974184636429))
	- Dopamine increase* above baseline 
	  by substance/activity:
	  Chocolate 55%
	  Nicotine 100%
	  Sex 100%
	  Cocaine 225%
	  Amphetamine 1000%
	  Adderall 1000%
	  *This scales with addictive potential & amount of decreased pleasure to other 
	  substances/activities.  Learn more:

	- Whether dopamine triggers or reflects the appetite to mate has been unclear. Until now. Turns out that dopamine triggers desire to mate. Suppression of the same dopamine neurons triggers abstinence. Powerful stuff (dopamine). https://t.co/tvPMPwqgBk ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1442584687675940868))
	- Diminished brown fat (& not microbiome) linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) in humans (Ahmed et al., Cell Reports Medicine 2021). Cold exposure 3-10min, 2-4X weekly increases: baseline dopamine 2.5X, brown fat density (& thus may offset nafld) & mental resilience. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1444346882747092994))
	- You can have stress without fear but you can’t have fear without stress. 
	  
	  You can have fear and/or stress without trauma but you can’t have trauma without fear and/or stress. 
	  
	  (Anxiety still awaits a clean operational definition). 
	  
	  Stress is foundational. 
	  Learn to control it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1445510786202226692))
	- We value sleep and dreaming. 
	  Most of us, however, quash the immensely valuable brain state that is the *first 90m post waking*. Regardless of alertness, we are primed at that time for “downloading” learning & insights, unless we firehose-gulp sensory information via our phone. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1446857966011838472))
	- @ardemp Hubel and Wiesel's remains a teaching tool. 
	  Their pioneering spirit comes through in every line. 
	  And... what a wonderful challenge to face writing such a lecture! So happy for you Ardem! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1451284491608092694))
	- @tferriss @lexfridman The interviews with @RayDalio @elonmusk (#2) @EricRWeinstein (Episode 163) & @LFeldmanBarrett ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1453747236513353734))
	- Pleasure is not a problem. Dopamine is not a problem. Too much pleasure experienced too often without a prior requirement for effort in order to achieve that pleasure/dopamine is terrible for us however. It lowers our baseline level of dopamine & the potency of all experiences. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1454906728286330882))
	- Cold Exposure Tools:
	  Resilience: 1X weekly, 1-3min 
	  Metabolism: 2X weekly/11min total 
	  Recovery: 3-6min after training
	  *Cold within 4 hours post-hypertrophy training may be counterproductive. (Showers fine).
	  How cold? “I really want to get out but can stay in safely”. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1457916698208595973))
	- Get cold easily? Exposure to cold water (shower, ice bath, cold plunge etc) for 11min per week (divided into 2-3 sessions), adjusts brown fat (around the heart mainly) which in turn heats the body more robustly and raises comfort in cold environments. Burns body fat as well. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1458773171386023936))
	- The Soeberg Principle: 
	  When using deliberate cold exposure to increase your metabolism, minimize hot showers & sauna after the last cold exposure. Forcing your body to re-warm on its own is a major component of the metabolism & brown fat (healthy, thermogenic fat) stimulation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1462541653621678082))
	- I get a lot of requests for neuroscience book recommendations. Liqun Luo’s Principles of Neurobiology is the best textbook out there. (Liqun is a Professor @Stanford & @HHMINEWS). 
	  (Note: I have no financial affiliation to it, but I did edit a few chapters). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1464373740557377544))
	- A lot of people get snagged on thoughts & feelings in their mind. 
	  It weighs them down. 
	  Remember: your nervous system, indeed you, leave no fossil record except your speech and actions. 
	  Thoughts & feelings matter (to varying degrees) but actions are your only legacy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1467155561091317766))
	- NEW HUBERMAN LAB PODCAST: ERASING FEAR & TRAUMA 
	  • Brain-Body Circuits of Fear
	  • Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
	  • EMDR & Somatics
	  • How Triggers Help Heal/Rewire 
	  • Ketamine, MDMA, Kava, Inositol

	- 4 useful points: 
	  1) Deliberate cold exposure has solid science to support its positive effects on metabolism & dopamine. 
	  2) Dopamine is a powerful internal resource to regulate. 
	  3) Testosterone makes effort feel good.
	  4) Sleep is the foundation of all mental & physical health. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1468316704610480132))
	- Most are adept at cycles of focus followed by rest in the form of weekends, vacation, etc.
	  Learning how to engage work-rest cycles on shorter time scales (daily hourly, etc) creates an outsized effect on productivity & health. 
	  The takeaway: learn to toggle between focus & rest. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1468949909000765440))
	- Predictions for 2022:
	  • Salt (proper use, amount & timing) is the new mental/physical performance tool.
	  • “Easily triggered” is understood as poor autonomic regulation/regressed.
	  • Zero-cost health information replaces pay-walled and pay-to-play seminars & programs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1471902275979251714))
	- A few key takeaways from the new HLP on Breathing & the Brain
	  
	  1) Learning & memory improves with nasal breathing. 
	  
	  2) We sigh deeply every ~5min to refill our lungs completely and offload C02.
	  
	  3) Alertness & reaction time improve during inhales & w/inhale-emphasized breathing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1481337447908737024))

	- These science supported protocols truly help (mind & body):
	  
	  1) For every 45 min of screen viewing, view a distant horizon for 5min (offsets myopia, headache, & fatigue). 
	  
	  2) Get into self generated optic flow (ideally outdoors) for 30min, 2X daily. [Treadmill wont do it]. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1484671459788210176))
	- Tend to lose focus & fatigue from desk work? Science says: 
	  
	  1) set screen height at or above nose level. 
	  
	  2) light the room from above throughout the day, light from the side or below from 4pm onwards. 
	  
	  3) alternate sitting & standing 1:1 ratio
	  
	  4) try 40Hz binaural beats ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1488265122690727936))
	- @hasib89542845 Lipids, hormones and a few other markers are enough for most people. I’ll do a post on this. Maybe a whole podcast. I will have a MD join me for balance and their additional expertise. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1488671299987656705))
	- Among the best things about our nervous system are that (in contrast to other organs of our body): 
	  
	  1) It controls our thoughts, feelings and actions.
	  
	  2) It can rewire & learn — indeed for the better, if the desire to do so is strong enough.

	- Grit, resilience & mental strength are not about avoiding your stress response to stressors. They stem from using tools to modulate your autonomic responses in real time & after bouts of non-negotiable stress to truly reset. These tools exist: https://t.co/9UgkQ7DepY ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1490053135049506816))
	- In science:
	  
	  Opposing data = “a field”
	  
	  Opposing opinions = “ongoing debate”
	  
	  Absence of an answer = “opportunity”
	  
	  Changing stance based on new information  = “integrity” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1490445131765272579))
	- HLP guest takeaways:
	  
	  1) Testosterone increases competitiveness in altruistic (e.g., charity auctions) & non altruistic (contact sport) competitions. 
	  Dr. R. Sapolsky
	  
	  2) Nutrient knowledge impacts satiety, even if false. 
	  Dr. Alia Crum
	  
	  Both discussions: https://t.co/TphgkozQyg ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1492658641622560769))
	- Areas of science not long ago considered fringe that now have federal (& other) support & 100s of labs at top institutions working to define mechanism/uses:
	  
	  1) Gut microbes (& Diet)
	  2) Psychedelics 
	  3) Deliberate Breathing 
	  
	  Makes you ask: what’s fringe now soon to be a focus? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1494021189215260674))
	- The scientific study of mindsets does not say that you can delude yourself into thinking/making stress feel good. It does reveal that if you adopt the “stress grows me & improves my performance over time” that it will do just that. See the amazing work of @AliaCrum @StanfordMed ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1490364282399125506))
	- Deliberate breath (regardless of the pattern) makes the mind visible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1496254710369886208))
	- “The total effect of anything is a combined product of what you´re doing and what you think about what you´re doing.”  Dr Alia Crum @AliaCrum @Stanford, expert on the science of #mindset

	- Takeaways from The Huberman Lab Podcast on Hormone Optimization
	  & Ep w/Dr Robert Sapolsky:
	  
	  1) Testosterone makes effort feel good
	  
	  2) Testosterone increases the amplitude of existing traits in the domain of competition
	  
	  3) Testosterone adjusts autonomic tone to reduce passivity ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1500274044792279040))
	- Key takeaways from Huberman Lab Podcasts on gut microbiome:
	  
	  1) daily consumption of low-sugar fermented foods is paramount
	  
	  2) fiber is recommended*
	  
	  3) highly processed (preservative filled) foods= bad
	  
	  4) extended fasts (>24hrs) deplete microbiome

	- @Breath_Guy @PeterAttiaMD I do. Or at least I try to. It takes 1-2 weeks to get used to but did allow me to tap into previously unrecognized endurance. One way to learn: do it with a mouth full of water… or a mouth guard. Or tape your mouth. Or just commit to no mouth breathing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1502288662049869827))
	- Statistical analyses of learning in different scenarios (physical or mental) indicate that setting the level of difficulty of what you’re trying to learn to where ~15% of attempts are fails (& thus, ~85% are successful), is optimal. 
	  Remember: fails = increased focus. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1504828837007294468))
	- One of the rarest and most admirable human traits is: self regulation of autonomic arousal. 
	  
	  (Reflects top-down prefrontal-to-limbic control). 
	  
	  Equates to: enhanced focus, accuracy of speech & actions & staying power in all endeavors. 
	  
	  It’s obvious when present, or absent. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1510308666095906821))
	- A simple, sure fire way too build strength, power and speed: 
	  “The Galpin 3 by 5 Concept”
	  Professor of Kinesiology @DrAndyGalpin on the latest Huberman Lab Podcast (full episode found at https://t.co/TphgkozQyg) 
	  #Biology #Fitness https://t.co/uEDD8xV4Fk ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1509891574238384133))
	- The best times of day to do deliberate cold or deliberate heat exposure (based on the post-exposure core body temperature changes they cause). Details & sources in full length podcast (timestamped) out now & found at https://t.co/TphgkozQyg https://t.co/6cx1X2uxTj ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1512216208799514628))
	- Deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure & cyclic hyperventilation each have been shown to cause: 
	  
	  1) increases in dopamine release
	  2) cortisol reduction
	  3) mitochondrial activation 
	  
	  These are all triggered by the same event: acute increases in adrenaline.

	- A Psychiatrist colleague defined narcissism well:
	  
	  “A person who holds no authority higher than their opinion of themself”. 
	  
	  (& then explained the developmental failures leading to this stance.)
	  
	  HLP with expert guest on #narcissism forthcoming. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1517162423043592192))
	- In this episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Associate Chair of Psychiatry @StanfordMed Dr David Spiegel MD, explains self hypnosis, its peer-reviewed applications for health & and anxiety & pain, why it works and the @reveri_health hypnosis app. #Science 
	  https://t.co/rvLgv4lnj9 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1525569590897479680))
	- Dopamine:
	  
	  1) is not about pleasure.
	  
	  2) drives motivation.
	  
	  3) mediates reward driven learning.
	  
	  4) is non-infinite but renewable.
	  
	  5) is also involved in movement.
	  
	  6) plays a role in vision. 
	  
	  7) can be controlled. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1536747795540938752))
	- First steps to fix messed up sleep-wake cycles, or afternoon crashing:
	  
	  1) Maximize morning sunlight viewing. 
	  
	  [Not through a window or windshield, no sunglasses, eyeglasses/contacts fine. Never stare at the sun of course]. 
	  
	  2) delay caffeine intake until 90min after waking. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1537905275398631426))
	- 25+ quality papers & reviews converge on the fact that increasing natural light exposure (especially in first 1-3 hrs of the day) + limiting bright artificial light 10pm-4am can improve mood, offset myopia, improve glucose tolerance, testosterone, estrogen and melatonin profiles. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1540054616963878912))
	- To ensure a terrible nights sleep: 
	  
	  1) nap more than 90min in the afternoon
	  
	  2) >100mg caffeine after 4pm 
	  
	  3) eat right before bed time (I confess I do this now and again, as I can’t fall asleep hungry)
	  
	  4) Sleep in on weekends more than 1hr longer than usual duration ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1549526083292147713))
	- You can tell who gets consistent time morning sunlight viewing & who doesn’t by simply asking them if they sleep well 80%+ of nights. Setting your circadian rhythm this way is zero cost, grounded in countless studies & while not the only variable for sleep, it is the top one. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1552793375379709956))
	- A simple but powerful exercise protocol to increase speed, power & strength:
	  
	  Choose 3-5 exercises
	  Do 3-5 reps
	  Do 3-5 sets
	  Take 3-5 min rest
	  Repeat 3-5 times per week
	  
	  "The 3 to 5 Concept" by @DrAndyGalpin as discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast https://t.co/13icCz1V0h ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1553501345084166144))
	- This @richroll podcast with @PeterAttiaMD as a guest is a must listen. The segment on Zone2 cardio is a gem. From now on I’m thinking Z2 max not V02 max (only). Listen to it; you’ll be smarter & better informed for health and performance by the end. So good! @Stanford https://t.co/JCh814y8k8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1555095468224327681))
	- We work harder when the end is in sight. It’s not about the end after all, it’s about narrow visual focus. We can leverage this to experience more motivation at any stage of effort. @EBalcetis of @nyuniversity explains on the Huberman Lab Podcast out now: https://t.co/Ib7KmIIxW6 https://t.co/qcWKxbwqWP ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1555569776793047041))
	- It is not surprising that low serotonin is not associated with depression & yet, SSRIs & other serotonergic agents (including psylocibin) have been shown in clinical trials to relieve depression. Serotonin does many things & has been shown to  be permissive for neuroplasticity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1556131886681837578))
	- One way to get better at nasal breathing in sleep (which is far healthier than being a mouth breather; apnea is really bad; see Jaws By Ehrlich & Kahn of @StanfordMed) is to restrict yourself to nasal breathing during zone 2 cardio.  (Which we should all be doing 180-200min/wk.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1556489802492456960))
	- New Huberman Lab Podcast Out Now:
	  TOOLS FOR OPTIMIZING SLEEP & SLEEP-WAKE TIMING

	- Dopamine does many things but one of the more important things dopamine does is set the threshold for us to pursue specific goals. In that sense dopamine is like a currency; all actions (and procrastination too) “spend” dopamine. Choose your actions wisely & toggle action & rest. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1567181142180401153))
	- Two science-supported & potent tools for increasing focus, concentration & memory:
	  
	  1) Daily 13 minute meditation*
	  
	  2) 300mg Alpha-GPC*
	  
	  * Don’t do within 4 hours of bedtime 
	  
	  ** To offset increased TMAO take 600mg garlic capsule 
	  
	  Details & Refs.: https://t.co/TphgkoRZMo ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1568652746567610370))
	- If you stay up late on Saturday and/or sleep in on Sunday, this is a synergistic circadian reset for the work week:
	  
	  Monday: wake 30min *earlier* than typical, 1-3min cold shower or bath, workout (if no time, then 10min any cardio), 10-15min sunlight viewing. Eat/fast per usual. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1571633800232439808))
	- Peer reviewed studies support that each of these has distinct benefits:
	  
	  Meditation: improves focus, insight.
	  
	  Yoga Nidra/NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest): replenishes dopamine, reduces cortisol, reduces total sleep need.
	  
	  (Clinical) hypnosis: can help solve specific problems. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1579673837134049280))
	- It’s OK to get the majority of your Zone 2 cardio quota (180-200min a week) with a long slow jog or hike (weight vested for the fitter folks out there) or swim or ride 1 day/week. I explain a complete schedule for endurance & strength & the rationale here: https://t.co/OZ7JLb3xbW ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1582405958197575685))
	- The @VirtusanApp has a zero cost 10min NSDR (Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest) protocol by @hubermanlab and a lot more including special resources for students.
