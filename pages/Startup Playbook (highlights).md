	- The way to test an idea is to either launch it and see what happens or try to sell it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz7n87xd6apec8qteqczp1re))
	- Finally, we ask about the market. We ask how big it is today, how fast it’s growing, and why it’s going to be big in ten years. We try to understand why the market is going to grow quickly, and why it’s a good market for a startup to go after. We like it when major technological shifts are just starting that most people haven’t realized yet—big companies are bad at addressing those. And somewhat counterintuitively, the best answer is going after a large part of a small market. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz7n92n2f59hkvjje8xj1ymd))
		- **Note**: Go after large part of small market.
	- he faster you can develop self-belief and not get dragged down too much by haters, the better off you’ll be. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz7n9x5gagydvg6v5jyecb8f))
	- So it’s better not to try too actively to force yourself to come up with startup ideas. Instead, learn about a lot of different things. Practice noticing problems, things that seem inefficient, and major technological shifts. [Work on projects you find interesting](http://blog.samaltman.com/projects-and-companies). Go out of your way to hang around smart, interesting people. At some point, ideas will emerge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz7nac4fnfgwy1k1byk6wp75))
		- **Note**: Learn, notice, practice, hang around smart people.
	- The best founders are unusually responsive. This is an indicator of decisiveness, focus, intensity, and the ability to get things done. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz7nb0veygdf8bf75cwmp749))
	- You want to build a “product improvement engine” in your company. You should talk to your users and watch them use your product, figure out what parts are sub-par, and then make your product better. Then do it again. This cycle should be the number one focus of the company, and it should drive everything else. If you improve your product 5% every week, it will really compound. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz7nbdx7y7q1vhxayh8w0ax3))
		- **Note**: Improve product 5% weekly; drives everything else.
	- “Do things that don’t scale” has rightfully become a mantra for startups. You usually need to recruit initial users one at a time (Ben Silbermann used to approach strangers in coffee shops in Palo Alto and ask them to try Pinterest) and then build things they ask for. Many founders hate this part, and just want to announce their product in the press. But that almost never works. Recruit users manually, and make the product so good the users you recruit tell their friends. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz7nc4d0vbkwvct90617e0d1))
		- **Note**: Recruit users manually, then make product great.
	- Founders and employees that are burn out nearly always work at startups without momentum. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz7ncyervr1yx29kn0ng05wz))
	- Extreme internal transparency around metrics (and financials) is a good thing to do. For some reason, founders are always really scared of this. But it’s great for keeping the whole company focused on growth. There seems to be a direct correlation between how focused on metrics employees at a company are and how well they’re doing. If you hide the metrics, it’s hard for people to focus on them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz7ndf55pqrwfphhwgk8b2yr))
		- **Note**: Founders should focus on metrics transparency.
	- Some of the biggest traps are the things that founders believe will deliver growth but in practice almost never work and suck up a huge amount of time. Common examples are deals with other companies and the “big press launch”. Beware of these and understand that they effectively never work. Instead get growth the same way all great companies have—by building a product users love, recruiting users manually first, and then testing lots of growth strategies (ads, referral programs, sales and marketing, etc.) and doing more of what works. Ask your customers where you can find more people like them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz7neaw331j0bc0kadcmwqma))
		- **Note**: Build product users love, test growth strategies, ask customers.
