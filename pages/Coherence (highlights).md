	- Physiological coherence leads to emotional coherence leads to cognitive coherence leads to behavioral coherence ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshzdzs3whh24x7w4a4b0c9k))
		- **Note**: The way our body works affects how we feel, which affects how we think, which affects how we act.
	- **2 key stages in human development** - waking up (lose dualism of power and control) and growing up (maturity) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshzehcj9cjjfz2eg8ek7c80))
	- **6 dimensions of EQ** - self-awareness, resilience, attention (internal motivation), social intuition (empathy), sensitivity to context, outlook (optimism/pessimism) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshzedczqzxkjz80qy98yn93))
	- **12 aspects of breath** - rhythmicity (steady in and out); smoothness; focus on heart; speed of breaths; pattern (ratio of in/out); volume; depth; entrainment; resistance; mechanics; flow patterns (air around body); special techniques (vipassana, [buteyko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteyko_method)) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshzers5f7fb5wbwsc90jvtv))
	- Emotion is integration of all physiological signals; feeling is the awareness and recognition that signal comes from the body (observation of emotion) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshzez6cqgc3tbm05h0qna78))
	- Huge number of our decisions are based on emotion, not reason. Emotional awareness therefore greatly improves decision-making ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshzf21k2jwqxt16qzc3zd1w))
	- Happiness is a habit ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshzf75a71q54xz77rcvezde))
	- **Intelligence is simply awareness**
	  
	  1.  Only 2 opposing emotional states - love and fear
	  2.  **Most people's emotional lexicon / palette very limited (becoming better versed and more nuanced in how you define each feeling allows you to become more self-aware**
	  3.  Must be aware but also be able to label individual emotions (access and then action) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshzfbxb4t0e6rpbx08rk90b))
		- **Note**: Coherence is the ability to be aware of one's emotions and to be able to label them. This can be accomplished by having a more nuanced understanding of different emotions and expanding one's emotional lexicon, rather than only recognizing two opposing states of love and fear. Once one is aware of an emotion, they can then take action and use it to become more self-aware.
	- cease to be a victim, don't let others control your emotions, complete ownership of all aspects of self ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshzgbrh6903h14trhttdgx7))
	- **9 internal phenomena which influence thinking, behavior, etc**
	  
	  1.  Values - feeling defined by a principle
	  2.  Belief - thought powered by emotion
	  3.  Attitude - collection of values / beliefs and which influences thoughts, behavior, perspective
	  4.  Culture - collective attitude of the group ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshzgkv16hgadad4kn40he6z))
		- **Note**: Coherence refers to the relationship between internal phenomena such as values, beliefs, attitudes, and culture, and how they influence thinking and behavior. Values are feelings defined by a principle, beliefs are thoughts powered by emotion, attitudes are collections of values and beliefs that influence thoughts, behavior, and perspective, and culture is the collective attitude of a group.
