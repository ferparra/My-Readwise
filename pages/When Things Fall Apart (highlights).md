	- Nontheism is relaxing with the ambiguity and uncertainty of the present moment without reaching for anything to protect ourselves. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BBXJH2C&location=663))
	- As human beings, not only do we seek resolution, but we also feel that we deserve resolution. However, not only do we not deserve resolution, we suffer from resolution. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BBXJH2C&location=852))
	- Less desire is the willingness to be lonely without resolution when everything in us yearns for something to cheer us up and change our mood. ([Location 874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BBXJH2C&location=874))
	- When we draw a line down the center of a page, we know who we are if we’re on the right side and who we are if we’re on the left side. But we don’t know who we are when we don’t put ourselves on either side. ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BBXJH2C&location=885))
	- Cool loneliness doesn’t provide any resolution or give us ground under our feet. It challenges us to step into a world of no reference point without polarizing or solidifying. This is called the middle way, or the sacred path of the warrior. ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BBXJH2C&location=922))

	- Pain is not a punishment; pleasure is not a reward. ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BBXJH2C&location=951))

	- Feeling inspired cheers us up, makes us realize how vast and wonderful our world is. Feeling wretched humbles us. The gloriousness of our inspiration connects us with the sacredness of the world. But when the tables are turned and we feel wretched, that softens us up. It ripens our hearts. It becomes the ground for understanding others. Both the inspiration and the wretchedness can be celebrated. We can be big and small at the same time. ([Location 954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BBXJH2C&location=954))
	- Instead of trying to avoid our uneasiness and offcenteredness by running away, we could begin to open our hearts to the human dilemma that causes so much misery in this world. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BBXJH2C&location=1042))
	- Having compassion starts and ends with having compassion for all those unwanted parts of ourselves, all those imperfections that we don’t even want to look at. ([Location 1203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BBXJH2C&location=1203))
	- That attitude leads to more appreciation and less burnout, because we do the job wholeheartedly and we care. On the other hand, each day is a new day; we’re not too future oriented. ([Location 1626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BBXJH2C&location=1626))
	- It’s not a matter of the right choice or the wrong choice, but simply that we are often presented with a dilemma about bringing together the inspiration of the teachings with what they mean to us on the spot. There is a perplexing tension between our aspirations and the reality of feeling tired, hungry, stressed-out, afraid, bored, angry, or whatever we experience in any given moment of our life. ([Location 1654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BBXJH2C&location=1654))
	- One can be grateful that a long lineage of teachers has worked with holding their seats with the big squeeze. They were tested and failed and still kept exploring how to just stay there, not seeking solid ground. They trained again and again throughout their lives not to give up on themselves and not to run away when the bottom fell out of their concepts and their noble ideals. From their own experience they have passed along to us the encouragement not to jump over the big squeeze, but to look at it just as it is, not just out of the corner of an eye. They showed us how to experience it fully, not as good or bad, but simply as unconditioned and ordinary. ([Location 1713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BBXJH2C&location=1713))
	- We don’t experience the world fully unless we are willing to give everything away. Samaya means not holding anything back, not preparing our escape route, not looking for alternatives, not thinking that there is ample time to do things later. ([Location 1910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BBXJH2C&location=1910))
	- We can use a difficult situation to encourage ourselves to take a leap, to step out into that ambiguity. ([Location 2076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BBXJH2C&location=2076))
