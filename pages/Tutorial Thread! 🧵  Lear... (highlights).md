	- Create a new artboard and add a nice background gradient - feel free to choose your own colors!

	- Cut out a model you want to use and add it to the artboard. For fast cutouts you can use https://t.co/Ppng7gS4y5

	- Now do the same in the foreground, but set the blending modes to ‚Äúexclusion‚Äù

	- Now we‚Äôre getting somewhere! Add a nice picture of some clouds on top of the backdrop and play around with the blending modes to find a fit that works for your composition. 
	  
	  Tip: Change the photos‚Äô saturation and tint to match your gradients!

	- Almost there‚Ä¶ Find another cool picture of a cloud and use a clipping mask on the model layer. 
	  
	  Play around with the blending modes again to find a nice fit. For this one I used ‚Äúhard light‚Äù

	- Add some noise as a top layer and make sure to include your logo/site so people can see who made this masterpiece

	- Fill in the areas that feel a little bit empty with some elements in the same color as your logo/website. 
	  
	  Think of lines, icons or nice typography ‚Äî anything goes! 
	  
	  For copy inspiration, I usually look at lyrics of tracks that I like (This one is Flume - The Difference)
