	- Change happens fast. 
	  
	  The most resilient and successful aren‚Äôt the ones reacting and trying to keep pace to change, they‚Äôre creating it. To be a changemaker in a constant state of change is difficult, but simple: always be learning. https://t.co/HzCLGJBJsJ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/notablyai/status/1618277985773301763))

	- We‚Äôre excited to introduce our comprehensive guide on the emerging role of Research Enablement to the world ü•πüåé 
	  
	  This guide is broken up into a framework called the 5 C‚Äôs of Research Enablement, which we‚Äôll publish & share in parts over the next weeks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/notablyai/status/1618277987375513602))
	- Highlights from Part One: Continuous Research  üëÄ
	  
	  If utilitarianism is what distinguishes design from art, then we need to constantly be validating that it is doing its job. To know If a solution is useful, research needs to be a continuous effort alongside design & development.

	- With ‚Äúalways-on‚Äù research,¬†asking questions and¬†finding answers becomes a regular habit. 
	  
	  Research excellence is not achieved in one single study. Rather, it's about analyzing habitual acts of research and using those findings to improve the experience over time.

	- Continuous research is a habit of:
	  
	  -speed: pivoting faster while the solution is malleable
	  -knowledge: making better, more informed decisions
	  -empathy: building better relationships w customers
	  -curiosity: asking q's & finding answers instead of best-guesses & intuitive leaps

	- Just like the world we‚Äôre in, the people we research and their wants and needs are in a constant state of change. As soon as research concludes, change begins again. A combination of dedicated  and ongoing research give us the best opportunity to react to that change.

	- Some ideas to implement a continuous research process in your org:
	- In the next part of our guide we dive deeper into the topic of involving others in research: Collaborative Research.
	  
	  Reducing the distance between research and those using it will result in a healthy, functioning continuous research machine. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/notablyai/status/1618278003162873860))
