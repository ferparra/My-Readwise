document_note:: The author claims that regular note-taking does not work because notes remain separate, and connections between ideas are not made by default. Through building a Zettelkasten, the author emphasizes actively connecting ideas during note-taking and encourages noting down each idea on a card, linking idea cards to other relevant idea cards and sorting cards into broader topic boxes. By putting more effort upfront, during note-taking, the process makes it easier to review and synthesize content when writing. The author uses Roam to implement the note-taking approach based on the Zettelkasten and makes each idea note into a permanent note. Therefore, finding related notes and writing become much more manageable.

	- Zettelkasten is German for “slip-box”. It originates from German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy3z17dy4rrzbngbr69f44r8))
	- Here’s how a Zettelkasten works:
	  
	  •   Write each idea you come across on a card.
	  •   Link idea cards to other relevant idea cards (idea -> idea link).
	  •   Sort cards into broader topic boxes (idea -> topic link). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy3z15ee0w6add4pbs3rxrnj))
	- Writing a permanent note takes effort. More effort than say… highlighting. You need to make connections with other notes and explain how they are related. You need to summarise the idea and knowledge in *your own words*, ensuring you *really understood*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy3z0vyznt2xecjz1gbyxaf2))
