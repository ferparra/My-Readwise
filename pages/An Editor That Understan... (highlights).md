	- Before we started Zed, we created Tree-sitter, an open-source parsing framework designed for editors: https://t.co/4amqnxbxwP
	  
	  Tree-sitter can re-parse a document quickly as it changes. Its built-in query engine lets you efficiently search for structural patterns in syntax trees. https://t.co/jsQn8FQFUK ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/zeddotdev/status/1641169195500212224))
