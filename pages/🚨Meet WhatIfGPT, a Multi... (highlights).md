	- 🚨Meet WhatIfGPT, a multi-generative agent simulation using @LangChainAI, @streamlit, @OpenAI GPT, and @elevenlabsio voice cloning!
	  
	  Name was inspired by Marvel's #WhatIf series.  What If? Harry, Ron, Hermione ended up in a wild multiverse?🤯Sound ON 🔊(1/5) https://t.co/8PKognSKIW ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/minchoi/status/1653134699038908438))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 💡This project was sparked by the paper on Simulacra on Generative Agents, and evolved over time with LangChain's experimental Generative Agent implementation with TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever for memory and @mmmbchang's awesome D&D simulation🐉(2/5)

	- 💡In this App, there's Storyteller Agent whose sole purpose is to narrate the story to the agents. Multiple modified generative agents play along, each with summarized memory to keep track of the story's progress 
	  
	  This is to ensure Agents doesn't lose focus (and they do!) (3/5) https://t.co/7Qu3avUX8x ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/minchoi/status/1653134702050418694))
	- 🤖Each Generative Agents uses their TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever with series of memories impacting their thinking and decision making.
	  
	  Story can be set manually or go wild with a random one! The Storyteller Agent leads the Agents to a cliffhanger ending with a twist!🍿(4/5) https://t.co/krrn0E1B3p ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/minchoi/status/1653134703497453577))
	- 🎙️I used Eleven Labs Voice Cloning for the Storyteller and the 3 Main characters, which turned out pretty good!
	  
	  Perhaps next step is to make this into Autonomous Generative Agents game! 🎲🎮Stay tuned!😉(5/5) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/minchoi/status/1653134704856506372))
	- I will be cleaning up the code a bit and put it up on my GitHub soon!
