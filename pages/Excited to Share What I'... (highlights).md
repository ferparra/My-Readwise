	- Excited to share what I've been up to at @RewindAI ‚ú®
	  
	  Rewind is a macOS app that fully utilizes the capabilities of Apple Silicon + Ventura to record everything you see, analyze it and make it searchable in real-time.

	- Can't find that tweet you know you saw once? Or wish you could go back 15 seconds to recover that long performance review you were writing before your browser crashed?
	  
	  You can search or rewind time. Once you've found what you're looking for you can even copy text from it.

	- One of the main reasons I joined Rewind was for all the unique design challenges.
	  
	  It's a full-screen, native macOS app (where I'm extensively using my Swift/SwiftUI skills ü•∞) that has no peer.
	  
	  There's lots of privacy considerations as well: the app is entirely local.

	- When enabled, Rewind can also record and automatically transcribe your meetings. Making it easy for you to search for something you or anyone has said in a meeting.
	  
	  Didn't catch what someone just shared in a meeting? Just rewind a few seconds.
