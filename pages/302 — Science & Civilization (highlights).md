	- The Lone Genius in the Scientific Wilderness
	  
	  Summary:
	  I feel like what we're living through is a, an instance where trust in scientific authority and consensus has been dialed way down. The institutions have also heaped shame upon their heads by being obviously politicized on various points. And yet it's also true that the lone voice in the scientific wilderness can completely upend the scientific consensus based on better arguments and better evidence.

	  And yet it's also true that the lone voice in the scientific wilderness is occasionally right and can completely upend the scientific consensus based on better arguments and better evidence. And it's in the presence of any given minority voice, you know, the one epidemiologist who says that, you know, these new mRNA vaccines are going to kill millions of people unless you really understand the field or even sometimes even if you do understand the field, it might not be immediately obvious if you're in the presence of a crank or a lone genius, right? And there's, and there's work to do to figure that out. And I feel like what we're living through now is a, an instance where trust in scientific authority and consensus has been dialed way down, right? The institutions have, and for understandable reasons and for obviously spurious ones. I mean, the institutions have also heaped shame upon their heads by being, you know, obviously politicized on various points, you know, in debates about, you know, gender and race. And I mean, it's just been some crazy stuff happening even in our best scientific journals. You've got epidemiologists by the thousands castigating right-wing people for their public demonstrations, but then supporting left-wing people for their public demonstrations all within the same pandemic. And so people have grown quite cynical, but I'm just wondering if you can speak to this core tension between trusting scientific authority and the progress of science being more or less anonymous with overturning authority, at least on certain points. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So there is a caricature of science which has understandable and obvious origins, but doesn't represent the typical scientific advance. The caricature is everyone believes one thing, and then there's some lone genius who comes up with an alternative idea that would negate or otherwise render wrong the prevailing view, and then they're suppressed, and then they finally rise up, and then it becomes the new paradigm. And that is not how most of this works. All right, so for example, take the discovery of the double helix. We did not have a prior paradigm before the double helix.
	  
	  Speaker 4
	  It's like, we just didn't know.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Right. Okay, it was, we don't know how it is.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  We're looking up comes the double helix. Oh, that's a good one.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  That works. And arguably one of the greatest discoveries in science was not the act of overthrowing a previously held idea. So, and I just want to make it clear that most discoveries in science are of that nature, not of the nature of overthrowing a previously held idea. That my first point, second, a previously held idea used the word consensus and authority often in those few moments. And I don't like the word authority because that implies you should do it because they have some position of power. ([Time 0:22:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c2f20f3a-1e4c-4d1d-bb3f-468410b5a933))
	- What Is the [[Scientific Consensus]]?
	  
	  Summary:
	  The most biased period of any field ever would be like 19th century anthropologist creating the races of man and ranking them. Just because an entire scientific community does not agree with you, it doesn't mean you're correct. We will call that a consensus, but has nothing to do with their opinions.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 3
	  And plus consensus, the way most people hear that word, it would be opinions, the gathering of opinions and you look at what the majority opinion is.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  We also use that word in science, but not to reference opinions, which creates some of this, this disconnect, communication disconnect. We use it for what is the scientific consensus and what that typically refers to is the research papers on this topic. What do they show? And the research paper is not a scientist's opinion. It is the scientist displaying data and provided they're not themselves biased. Like I said, there's always that risk, especially in the scientific fields that involve the measurement and the analysis of other human beings. They tend to be particularly susceptible to bias. This would include all the fields of psychology and the most biased period of any field ever would be like 19th century anthropologist creating the races of man and ranking them and judging them and making that the foundation of the science of eugenics, right? There's a whole thing. You have to like look really carefully when people start ranking other people. What is their field? What is their motive? What is their funders and the like? In the physical sciences, which is a little more distant from the social sciences and the biological sciences, more distant from human beings, we're a little bit less susceptible to that. And so you look at what is the body of research show. We will call that a consensus, but has nothing to do with their opinions. When I assert that if you have 97 research papers saying one thing because the data shows it and one person says no, you should bet on that consensus because that's how it goes. The one person that says, do you have data? Do you have, well, I don't think it's that way.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  Go check it out.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  People find out that they will cherry pick things to fit their needs or their beliefs or their worldview. And just because an entire scientific community does not agree with you, it doesn't mean you're correct.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  Okay.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So, and the point with Newton becoming Einstein, this is a fascinating chapter. Here's the towering achievements of classical physics. And we have Newtonian gravity and Newtonian motion. Oh my gosh. It's explaining everything.
	  
	  Speaker 5
	  But then, wait a minute, there's some things that doesn't explain.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  Ooh. Okay. Well, there's Mercury's orbit and there's weirdnesses and Einstein comes along. ([Time 0:25:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/44b12569-ac15-414b-b322-e249d2e1f76e))
