	- A week before he died, Musashi wrote the Dokkōdō, or The Way of Walking Alone.
	  
	  It consisted of 21 rules and provided a roadmap to live life by.
	  
	  The rules are strict and harsh, but honest and powerful.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1. Accept everything just the way it is.
	  
	  For generations, men have been known for dominance and control.
	  
	  However, not everything can be controlled.
	  
	  Flexibility is a key aspect in an even-tempered man. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560282906832900))
	- 2. Do not seek pleasure for its own sake.
	  
	  The search for pleasure is a dangerous adventure.
	  
	  Along the way, many men have gotten lost in pleasure.
	  
	  Alcohol
	  Drugs
	  Sex
	  
	  Go into pleasure with you mind aware
	  
	  Because on the other side of pleasure is pain. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560285092024327))
	- 3. Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling.
	  
	  Go into everything whole-heartedly and non-apologetic.
	  
	  Mindless actions are typically stupid ones.
	  
	  Mindless experiences are typically forgettable ones. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560286916497409))
	- 4. Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.
	  
	  Ego blinds and ego destroys.
	  
	  Go into any experience humble and respectful of your fellow man. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560290351722496))
	- 5. Be detached from desire your whole life long.
	  
	  I've discussed attachment many times.
	  
	  The two strongest fears that men typically face is fear of death and fear of missing out. Both are born from attachment.
	  
	  If you do not control yourself, you will be controlled. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560293187035152))
	- 6. Do not regret what you have done.
	  
	  Regret and guilt are both useless emotions.
	  
	  The past cannot be changed and the future cannot be determined.
	  
	  Focus on the present.
	  
	  You can't move forward while looking behind. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560295271555076))
	- 7. Never be jealous.
	  
	  Envy is a bottomless pit of suffering.
	  
	  There will never be enough and you will never feel like you are enough.
	  
	  Don't seek to be the best.
	  
	  Seek to be the best version of yourself. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560297792385031))
	- 8. Never let yourself be saddened by a separation.
	  
	  We circle back to attachment.
	  
	  Attachment leads to fear and fear results in pain.
	  
	  Live fully in the moment because you can't control the future. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560300892004353))
	- 9. Resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself or others.
	  
	  Resentment is typically born from jealousy and greed.
	  
	  Seek to be the best version of yourself and complain about nothing.
	  
	  Don't waste energy complain, spend energy doing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560302942990341))
	- 10. Do not let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust or love.
	  
	  Lust is a dangerous emotion and many men have sacrificed everything and been ruined by it.
	  
	  Love is a pure emotion, but a man can be blinded by it.
	  
	  Maintain awareness. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560304801067009))
	- 11. In all things have no preferences.
	  
	  Remaining open minded relates to the flexibility we talked about in the first rule.
	  
	  Bias can be a waste of opportunity in business, love, and learning. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560306805833730))
	- 12. Be indifferent to where you live.
	  
	  Blind patriotism is antiquated.
	  
	  Find a region you like with weather that you enjoy and people you get along with.
	  
	  Plus, all you need is an internet connection to make money these days. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560308714385418))
	- 13. Do not pursue the taste of good food.
	  
	  Food should be consumed for nutrition.
	  
	  Taste is secondary.
	  
	  Man cannot live on ice cream alone. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560310752780288))
	- 14. Do not hold on to possessions you no longer need.
	  
	  You will never realize how much useless stuff you own and never use until you are packing to move.
	  
	  Actively declutter.
	  
	  This goes hand-in-hand with rule 12. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560312229126144))
	- 15. Do not act following customary beliefs.
	  
	  Learn to think for yourself.
	  
	  Find your own traditions and rituals.
	  
	  The majority of people are NPCs so you should take pride in being different. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560314041110529))
	- 16. Do not collect weapons or practice with weapons beyond what is useful.
	  
	  Every man should learn to fight and defend himself and those around him.
	  
	  However, do not be consumed by it.
	  
	  And remember, no plan survives the first point of contact. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560316029157379))
	- 17. Do not fear death.
	  
	  Attachment again, noticing a pattern?
	  
	  The greatest irony is that those most afraid of death are also afraid to live. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560317748924422))
	- 18. Do not seek to possess either goods or fiefs for your old age.
	  
	  This is the one that may be more contextual for the time and Musashi's occupation as a wandering samurai.
	  
	  However, it is still a good point to mention the danger of greed.
	  
	  There is such thing as too much. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560319661424649))
	- 19. Respect Buddha and the gods without counting on their help.
	  
	  Regardless of your faith (or lack thereof), respect your fellow man and depend on nothing but yourself.
	  
	  Men lie and gods don't answer every prayer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560321108561921))
	- 20. You may abandon your own body but you must preserve your honour.
	  
	  While it is important to never be apologetic, a man must follow his own ethics and values.
	  
	  To betray one's own ethics is to compromise one's soul. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560323214090241))
	- 21. Never stray from the Way.
	  
	  Go into everything whole-heartedly and do not stray from your own way.
	  
	  A man who lies to himself loses the ability to understand the truth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560324753362946))
	- As you can see, Musashi's 21 rules were strict and ascetic.
	  
	  However, through these rules a man can attain mastery of themself.
	  
	  "If you wish to control others you must first control yourself"
	  
	  -Miyamoto Musashi ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Debtlifts/status/1426560326401671168))
