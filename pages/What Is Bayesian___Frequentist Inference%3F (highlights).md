	  Bayesian Inference is Great For Doing Bayesian Inference.**
	  
	  **Frequentist inference and Bayesian Inference are defined by their goals, not their methods.**

	  **Confidence Intervals Do Not Represent Degrees of Belief.**  
	  **Posterior Intervals Do Not (In General) Have Frequency Coverage Properties.**
	  
	  **Saying That Confidence Intervals Do Not Represent Degrees of Belief Is Not a Criticism of Frequentist Inference.**

	  **Some Scientists Misinterpret Confidence Intervals as Degrees of Belief.**  
	  **They Also Misinterpret Bayesian Intervals as Confidence Intervals.**
