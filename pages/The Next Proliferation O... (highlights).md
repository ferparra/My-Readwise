- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Apr 16th, 2023]]
	- The next proliferation of AutoGPT demos will clearly be about writing code, including building out entire websites w/ backend & iOS/Android apps.
	  
	  It makes sense â€” spin up individual agents to build out parts of a project: views, logic, model code, etc â€” and then have an agentâ€¦ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanwchan/status/1647306441651519491))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- @mckaywrigley got this demo trend going with his own AI agent â€” deploying an entire web app, with a backend and auth, uploading it to GitHub and then deploying it to Vercel. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanwchan/status/1647306741426835461))
	- @SullyOmarr got a simple React website built using @SigGravitasâ€™s Auto-GPT in only a few minutes, and spending only about $1 on OpenAI GPT calls.
	  
	  Getting the AutoGPT prompting right was the challenge here, as itâ€™s still prone to get stuck in loops and not do what you want it to. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanwchan/status/1647306809240346624))
	- Fun fact: Auto-GPTâ€™s first pull request was by: itself!

	  @SigGravitas (creator of Auto-GPT) also mentioned in the discord that it wrote other parts of the code as well.

	- @SigGravitas has a gaming background so I certainly expect some AutoGPT design considerations for that use-case.
	  
	  Some remarks on this in the AutoGPT discord:

	- I have yet to see any attempt in using AutoGPT to write native iOS or Android apps.
	  
	  Oh wait, Iâ€™m an iOS developer â€” I might give it a try! ðŸ˜‰
	  
	  Would be a cool thing to put on my resume â€” using an AI agent to put myself out of job ðŸ¤£ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanwchan/status/1647306828202790913))
	- But seriously, will AutoGPTs *replace* developers? @chamath seems to think so (ahem, heâ€™s not a developer).
	  
	  Where I think heâ€™s wrong is that these agents just flat out donâ€™t have any judgementâ€¦ yet.
	  
	  Even if they can spit out code at a faster pace than any expert developer,â€¦ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanwchan/status/1647306830144749568))
	- I imagine a ton of developers are tinkering with AutoGPT at this very moment trying to get it to build entire projects â€” taking this whole GPT-copilot concept to the next level.
	  
	  For now, Iâ€™m excited to see where this is all headed and will continue to post on what I find.
	  
	  Iâ€™llâ€¦ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanwchan/status/1647306832258670595))
