	- 1/ Personal update: I‚Äôll be joining @AaveAave as a Product Manager, leading Web3 experiments!
	  
	  Excited to build the future with @StaniKulechov @RebeccaRettig1 @The3D_ @jessica_sit @Nogoodtwts @coconidodev @digitlartifacts @A_BertoG @davidesilverman and the rest of the Aave fam üëª ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1450131974547443716))

	- 2/ You can read the whole story here in on @viamirror
	- 3/ Why am I building experiments?
	  
	  The future to me is clear: Web3 is an inevitability. But no one is exactly sure how it will manifest itself
	  
	  It takes a team with a strong vision and a high appetite for experimentation to map out the new Internet

	- 4/ Web3 supercharges the experimentation that we‚Äôre seeing ‚Äî thanks to the open, permissionless building blocks we‚Äôve created
	  
	  DeFi Summer was the direct result of open experimentation ‚Äî what happens if we apply this for all of Web3?

	- 5/ The best minds in Web3 are tackling that question
	  
	  They‚Äôre experimenters, not only building PoCs but also getting the community to build on their ideas‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää to create something greater than the original architect could ever imagine

	- 6/ I love experimenting & being a builder
	  
	  But I also love creating communities in Web3
	  
	  I‚Äôve always been at odds with those 2 ends: how can I ship technical products if my passion is in growing communities of people?

	- 7/ @stani made me realize that this isn‚Äôt a dichotomy but rather a brand-new way of building products in a Web3-native way
	  
	  The new problem space is: ‚ÄúHow do we inspire a community to co-build with us?‚Äù
	  
	  Product + Community = the new Web3 builder toolkit

	- 8/ Aave has never been shy about experimentation: liquidity pools, multi-chain deployment, multi-chain governance
	  
	  So it was no surprise to me (ok maybe a little) when Stani tweeted about building a social media protocol

	- 9/ I personally won‚Äôt be too involved in this initiative, but the announcement spoke volumes about the vision and the culture of Aave
	  
	  The social media protocol and Aave‚Äôs dedication to further experimentation marks a brand new chapter for the team ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1450132129824784389))
	- 10/ As they chart the course to be a stronghold in the Web3 space, I want to be at the tip of the spear‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcreating the future as a new breed of PM.
	  
	  One that builds in public, not in a black box
	  
	  One that doesn't see 'community' as a buzzword, but foundational for innovation ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1450132134237192200))
	- 10/ I can‚Äôt do this alone. I need your help.
	  
	  If you have any ideas, DM me or reply to this thread!
	  
	  Let‚Äôs embark on this insane journey to the forefront of crypto together ü§ù
	  
	  h/t to @chaserchapman, @0xKirkusMaximus & @RebeccaRettig1 for your help refining my thoughts ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1450132135831035905))
