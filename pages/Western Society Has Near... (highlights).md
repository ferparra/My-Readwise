- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 18th, 2022]]
	- Western society has nearly completely lost the infrastructure that could support complex thinking. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamoBurja/status/1368298391235682304))
	- To dig into the relevant infrastructure:
	  
	  1. A culture open to voicing accurate observations about itself. Every capable thinker voices these early in life before they learn better, if this disqualifies them, the culture cannot support original thinkers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamoBurja/status/1368300219117535234))
	- 2. Viable economic niches. Academia is much too contested. Silicon Valley allows for some original thinking, but the thinking isn't what provides returns. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamoBurja/status/1368300221017567240))
	- 3. Viable social niches. Trust fund kids don't have a leisured class that values thought they could join. The role of public intellectual is extinct, it is possible to be a popularizer. Comparable to say Polybius. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamoBurja/status/1368300223165005830))
	- 4. Viable knowledge succession. Deep mentoring is considered unfair, threatening or cult-like. The assumption is always that the most recent experts have the best information in a field. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamoBurja/status/1368300224754688004))
	- The socioeconomic structure of society was intelligence proofed long before the internet educated showed up. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamoBurja/status/1368314532809093127))
	- There was significant variation in among past societies. 
	  
	  Some intellectual golden ages: Classical Greece, Hellenistic Greece (Science), Abbasid Golden Age, Italian Renaissance
	  etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamoBurja/status/1368530703785201672))
