	- I've worked with two types of teams in my career:
		- **Note**: Thread
	- I much prefer teams of makers.
	  
	  Teams that execute, I've mostly seen at big companies. Employees are only informed of what they need to know to do their job. They can't find solutions to problems they don't know about, they rarely learn new skills and tend to lose some over time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/syswarren/status/1433839915352174597))
	- Teams of makers usually know what the mission of the company is. They are involved and can contribute to it. They can learn new skills and expand their responsibilities if they want to.
	  They tend to stick around longer too.
