	- Birthrates are falling in the rich world and elsewhere. Women and men in these places on average want 2 children but have far fewer. Why? I think we‚Äôve been missing something  üßµ

		- **Note**: Thread
	- We tend to blame this (in the UK) on problems like lack of housing, income, and childcare

	- But this can‚Äôt be right. Today‚Äôs millennials live in greater luxury in these respects than their fertile contemporaries in poorer countries and of course most of their fertile ancestors. And it is upper class millennials among whom birth rates are falling most

	- It‚Äôs not about the money. We‚Äôve been increasing birth incentives since the 90s but birth rates have fallen

	- Ok so it‚Äôs about social structures then: available childcare and career penalties for mothers
	  
	  Well, not really. In our fertile recent past, remember, women suffered even larger career penalties. And even in Nordic childcare utopias, birthdates are too low and in general decline

	- These policies are of course good on their own terms. But they don‚Äôt shift birthrates all that much

	- In fact falling birthrates are tied firmly to one metric: rising female empowerment
	  
	  Contraception, abortion, richer life choices mean women can choose to have fewer kids
	  
	  But that DOESN‚ÄôT explain why women are having fewer children than THEY THEMSELVES would like
	  
	  Why is that?

	- Here‚Äôs a suggestion: surveys suggest THE TOP reason for women not having as many children as they would like is not finance or childcare or lifestyle related.
	  
	  These women just have not found the right man

	- Hang on, why do only modern women have this problem? 
	  
	  Well, ‚Äújust not finding the right man‚Äù is a MODERN LUXURY. 
	  
	  In the past, women who didn‚Äôt find Mr Right would likely at some point have to pair with Mr Wrong: single life was just too miserable and poverty stricken

	- Women may not ideally want to be single and childless but they can now afford to be IF the right man doesn‚Äôt come along
	  
	  That solves our paradox: why women who have more choice end up with fewer children than they would like

	- Their first choice might still be ‚Äúmarriage and babies with Mr Right‚Äù. But their SECOND CHOICE is staying single. 
	  
	  Their grandmother‚Äôs and mother‚Äôs second choice would more likely have been ‚Äúmarriage and babies with Mr Wrong‚Äù ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Martha_Gill/status/1624697040457416707))
	- But if our theory is correct, what should policy makers do? They can‚Äôt just demand women - or men - pair up with Mr and Miss Wrong.
	  
	  Women (and many men) have freely decided they would rather pay the price of not doing so and have no spouse or children at all

	- Well here‚Äôs a radical solution: target single parents. Policy makers could make it a lot easier to have a child alone. Single mother numbers are already bucking the birthrate trends. If we really want to tackle the birthrate problem: that‚Äôs where they should start
