	- I think the two biggest problems in product management are...
	  
	  1. Far too much Work in Progress.
	  
	  2. An infinite backlog. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1622992061828853761))

	- The first problem basically means that instead of making one or two huge product leaps every quarter, you're advancing on dozens of different fronts, but finishihg almost none of them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1622992650839244800))
	- The second problem is basically that it's so much easier to add something to a backlog than deliver it from the backlog. As such the backlog continually grows much faster than you can service it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1622992894503137281))
	- I think the best way round this is to create product management processes (i.e. governance) that limits a) how many things you can be working on concurrently and b) prevents the backlog from growing out of control. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1623001272776269824))
