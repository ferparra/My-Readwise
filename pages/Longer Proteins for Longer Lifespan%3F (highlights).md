	- For those of us who believe that aging is programmed into the life cycle, [gene expression](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363855760_The_epigenetics_of_aging) seems the most likely transmission of information about age through the body. Different genes are turned on and off at different stages of development and through the lifetime ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhaqpt8e655ygy24barr17g))

	- Human engineering is based on understanding and isolating causes. One mechanism is designed for each desired effect. Biochemistry doesn’t work that way. Every molecule has multiple functions and every function requires many chemical components to make it work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmharg02zdvdvtvr20j98bda))
	- The advantage of nature’s way is robustness. When a component fails, alternative pathways open up to take up the slack. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmharwvzcrncxgty4tw3sw5q))
	- Both Katcher and the Northwestern authors mention the possibility that mRNA splicing might be impaired with age. In all eukaryotes (that’s everything larger than bacteria), genes are not stored contiguously in our chromosomes, but rather in segments that code for modules, or pieces of a protein. The mRNA is copied from the chromosome, and then various pieces of mRNA are spliced together to form a full, functional gene before the reconstituted mRNA is delivered to a ribosome to be read and translated into a protein. Presumably, longer proteins require more splicing, so impaired RNA splicing could account for a deficit of longer proteins as we age.
