	- ⭐ PPV ⭐
	  My current Life Operating System
	  
	  PPV stands for Pillars, Pipelines, and Views.
	  
	  It is an incredible productivity system created by @augustbradley.
	  
	  I have been using it for about a year now. Let's look at the basics.

	- /1 The Goal
	  The whole PPV system is about integrating systems to gain better focus and alignment, with knowledge resurfacing at the right time.
	  
	  With PPV I tie my tasks to my goals, habits, and values and track my overall progress regularly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cctechwiz/status/1439197518760333321))
	- /2 Pillars
	  Organize by Cross-Cutting Life Segments
	  
	  This is where you define what categories your life involves.
	  
	  For me this includes;
	  * Mind Expansion
	  * Health, Fitness & Sleep
	  * Husband, Father & Family
	  * Finances & Admin
	  * Hobbies & Entertainment
	  * Job & Career ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cctechwiz/status/1439197519997636610))
	- /3 Pipelines
	  Action & Process Flow
	  
	  This is where things happen.
	  
	  Pipelines have multiple stages and each stage can be different depending on the pipeline.
	  
	  Some pipelines I have include;
	  * Action Items
	  * Projects
	  * Content Creation
	  * Goals
	  * Dungeons and Dragons Prep ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cctechwiz/status/1439197521155223565))
	- /4 Vaults
	  Knowledge Management & Information Resurfacing
	  
	  This is where you store things that are important to you. You assign each item a tag so they can resurface in the right contexts.
	  
	  Some of my vaults include;
	  * Media Vault
	  * Trainings & Courses
	  * Quotes
	  * Notes & Ideas ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cctechwiz/status/1439197522321293324))
	- /5 Cycles
	  Review & Maintain
	  
	  The key to maintaining any useful system is to review it regularly.
	  
	  With PPV you review different levels of your system at intervals appropriate for you.
	  
	  Action Items -> Daily
	  Projects & Goal Outcomes -> Weekly
	  Goal Outcomes & Value Goals -> Monthly ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cctechwiz/status/1439197523512479751))
	- /6 My Key Takeaway
	  
	  Over the last year implementing PPV I've learned that a key part of my productivity hinges on being able to see EVERYTHING that is important to me (goals & projects) and that is currently in flight (other pipelines) and then plan my weeks and days accordingly.

	- /7 Where to learn more
