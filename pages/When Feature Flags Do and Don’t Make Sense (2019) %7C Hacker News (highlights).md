	- Windows (what ships inbox, that is), as of last week (Sep 14) [2], has roughly 2500 feature flags. Some are permanently jammed into the on position, some off position, and the rest are configurable by its experimentation frameworks and hackers. (Apps are a separate beast, have their own experimentation tooling, their own flags, etc.)
	- If a flag hasn't changed state in a period of time, or hasn't been queried in a period of time, then an issue is filed against the relevant repositories.
