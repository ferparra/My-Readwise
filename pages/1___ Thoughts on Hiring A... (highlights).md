	- 1/ Thoughts on hiring a great Product leader
	  
	  *Disclaimer*: this is a founder perspective, based on my experience at Auth0.

	- 2/ First, the definition of a great Product leader depends on the stage of the company. 
	  
	  Before Series A, if founders have a strong product culture you don't need one. You can survive to Series B and C even. But... the more you wait the bigger the org tax will be. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/woloski/status/1369426190679834633))
	- 3/ So... sooner rather than later you will find yourself needing a Product organization because there is so much going on :). So I think about two different types of product leader:
	  
	  üîπ Growth and Chaos (post-Series A)
	  üîπ At Scale (post-Series C/D) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/woloski/status/1369426191942352902))
	- 4/ Growth and Chaos (post-Series A) üí£
	  
	  At this stage, the most important things a great VP Product can help founders with is: *prioritization, process and stakeholder mgmt*. 
	  
	  After Series A, Engineering starts getting flooded with requests: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/woloski/status/1369426193188020235))

	- 5/ üîπ sales needs a feature to close a big prospect
	  üîπ support escalate things they can‚Äôt handle
	  üîπ security needs vulnerabilities closed
	  üîπ engineers want to solve tech debt/scalability issues.
	  üîπ And you also have the roadmap. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/woloski/status/1369426194563801089))
	- 6/ It is tough. As much as you want to make progress on all fronts, you can‚Äôt. There are not enough people, and hiring more is not the solution either (not in the short/mid-term).
	  
	  So the perfect VP of Product for that stage is someone who can manage stakeholders. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/woloski/status/1369426195595550723))

	- 7/ They will need to manage everyone‚Äôs anxiety and expectations. They need a proven operational model. Something that worked in the past for them. "Having done it before" helps in establishing trust and educating stakeholders. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/woloski/status/1369426196606423047))
	- 8/ If they haven‚Äôt done it before, they will be questioned. Because things will go wrong and it‚Äôs then when you need to bring confidence.
	  A VP of Engineering will help a lot as well (providing input and rationale on the all-things engineering). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/woloski/status/1369426197919174656))
	- 9/ Of course, that person will also have to hire the first Product Managers to help them. So their network will be important to bring those initial PMs. A strong PM will make a huge difference on the teams they work with. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/woloski/status/1369426199131414536))
	- 10/ Bringing Product Management into an Engineering org is disruptive. Priorities will be questioned, data will be asked, plans will be changed‚Ä¶ Be prepared for friction :) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/woloski/status/1369426200402272260))
	- 11/ At Scale (Post-Series C/D) üöÄ
	  
	  Once you are past that stage (could take 2/3 years after Series A), the shape of a great VP of Product changes. At that point, the machinery should be more or less working and there is more people/structure (e.g. VP/Director/Manager). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/woloski/status/1369426201379495947))
	- 12/ A great VP of Product's main job will be to help landing the broader vision/mission and strategy of the Product. Typically, is also the time when you start thinking about ‚Äúwhat markets & adjacencies we can get into‚Äù. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/woloski/status/1369426202423869441))
	- 13/ To land vision/strategy, they need to learn about the domain, understand what customers are asking, tag team with founders and Head of Sales/CS.... and then synthesize all that in a format that can be used with customers, partners and employees. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/woloski/status/1369426203615109123))
	- 14/ From an operational perspective, they need to be good at setting the pace, hiring (especially Director-level people), budgeting, reorgs, etc. They can work with Chief of Staff to help with the administrative aspect of the role. Again, experience doing all this is critical. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/woloski/status/1369426204600786951))
	- 15/ Last but not least, this person needs to dive into things at any time. Knowing the pulse of the organization, what‚Äôs going on, the ‚Äúreal‚Äù health of the teams. Executives who stay high level can be very damaging. This is one of the most difficult things to find in executives. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/woloski/status/1369426205838094346))
	- 16/ We were lucky to find @thinkshiv who has all these traits.
	  
	  He is doing a talk tomorrow at @saastr Build "What To Expect From a (Great) VP+ of Product" where he will talk about a lot of these things. Don't miss it! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/woloski/status/1369426206907596800))
