document_note:: In this episode of EconTalk, Michael Easter and Russ Roberts discuss the consequences of comfort and how Misogi experiences can be a solution. Boredom can be seen as an opportunity to look inward, not outward. Marcus Elliot's modern Misogi interpretation is to identify a challenging task with a 50/50 chance of completion and recognize the certainty of death. This helps one rebalance their view on comfort and challenge and can be a transformative experience.
