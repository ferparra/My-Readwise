	- Classical thinkers, who assess objects in the world in terms of their functions ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/19cd8b68-ec1e-41d8-9930-bc02991851c8))
	- Romantic thinkers, who assess objects in the world in terms of their appearance. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/7853ae5a-f993-4ef8-80ef-3ed4331cac6f))
	- Pirsig’s Chautauquas on technology aim to show that technological work is creative (or, at least, can be). It’s all a matter of the mindset we bring to it. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/afa40da2-3b46-4238-ab46-58bd9226e237))
	- Pirsig urges us to experiment, to try something that hasn’t been vetted by the experts, to innovate. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/4438a9aa-06a3-443a-ae32-48863e47b429))
	- Although Quality has a highly technical philosophical significance (more just below), it also means “value” or “goodness.” (The subtitle of ZAMM is “An Inquiry Into Values.”) ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/c419ae2e-457d-40f4-aa79-ceb995342460))
	- Phaedrus’s concept of Quality placed it at the very beginning of human knowledge and experience—in fact, Phaedrus believed that Quality was the source of that knowledge and experience. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/c8b1139c-30bb-47ce-9864-64ffcf28dc6e))
	- The Tao is a mystical entity impossible to name or adequately express, yet it generates and directs the universe. One can “know” the Tao not through words but through outlook and experience. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/54b365ac-7623-4fa4-a510-66cbb85956d6))
	- to be attuned to Quality, we must cultivate a “beginner’s mindset”—we must forget what we know (or think we know) and simply meditate on the task in front of us. This is why it’s Pirsig’s firm belief that to be “stuck”—on a work or creative project, on making a life decision—is actually, counter-intuitively, the best place to be. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/1cc936ab-27e9-4f34-9376-31b2a50b3cba))
	- Pirsig suggests that his and Chris’s road trip isn’t about arriving at any particular destination—rather, it’s about the traveling itself. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/6e8ccdf9-8bd7-4f9e-a08a-ece0c4da4b48))
	- Pirsig’s entire book, which meanders and digresses and takes its time, can be seen as a testament to the principle that “sometimes it’s a little better to travel than to arrive.” ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/0a3efdc5-0bab-44c5-9ca3-7f6922ba503b))

	- No pure truths as they cannot possibly apply to every person in every situation. Need to look through life in a broader way – Quality and Truth are in fact one. The ancient Greeks divorced Quality and Truth and this was an artificial divorce which causes a lot of frustration ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshxyd34c7dmtmz4ack060w0))
	- Values create the objects of the world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshxxx96nz186vqbvhe8wdhh))
	- [Mu questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)) are extremely important – no definite answer, indeterminate state, not applicable, unasking the question, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshxsvj08stqsmmeazbjah13))
		- **Note**: Mu questions are questions that have no definite answer, and involve an indeterminate state, rendering them not applicable. They involve "unasking" the question, rather than searching for an answer.
	- Looking at things dualistically is what causes evil – all is one ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshxrybsszx4cmgpctxp1akd))
	- Aim to make as many quality decisions as this will have a ripple effect and influence others to also make quality decisions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshxrta8r8t10qj2661mm2tt))
