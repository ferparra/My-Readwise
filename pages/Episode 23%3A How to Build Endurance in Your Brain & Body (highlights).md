document_note:: This document outlines the different types of endurance training and their benefits, as well as strategies for improving brain and body endurance. The five main drivers of effort in the body are neurons, muscle, heart, blood, and lungs. Muscular endurance training protocol involves 3-5 sets of 12-100 repetitions with a rest period between 30-180 seconds. Long duration endurance training protocol involves one set of anything longer than 12 minutes. Anaerobic HIIT endurance protocol involves 3-12 sets with a work to rest ratio of 3:1 or 1:5. Aerobic HIIT endurance protocol involves 3-12 sets with a work to rest ratio of 3:1 or 1:1. Dr. Andrew Huberman emphasizes that quitting is mental, not physical, and that proper hydration and rest are essential to improving endurance.

- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Mar 12th, 2023]]
	- The goal of training is to build mitochondrial density to be able to repeat while burning less fuel and becoming more efficient ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv81zcasjnwew6hc0kpjr8he))
	- **Benefits of long duration endurance:** build capillary beds within the muscle, increases mitochondria, increases the delivery of oxygen to muscles ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv81z1s863evpnwtpeegmf34))
	- Takes breathing and system beyond 100% of VO2 max ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv81zk42vhnxc8mfkvkxph4r))
	- **Benefits of anaerobic endurance:** increase capillary beds, increase the ability of neurons to access more energy, build capacity to engage short bursts of intense work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv81zs9n64wtt076nd557p9n))
	- **Aerobic HIIT endurance protocol:** 3-12 sets with a 3:1 ratio (e.g., 30 seconds work: 10 seconds rest) – or 1:1 ratio (e.g., 30 seconds work: 30 seconds rest)
	  
	  •   Work periods should be 8-12 minutes and done 2-3 times per week ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv81zy8mzrhah00qs4hny68f))
	- Remember, neurons need water and electrolytes to fire ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv82067nygjffhkey3hh43je))
	- Take 5-10 minutes after exercise to focus on breathing or lie down and mellow out after training to assist in recovery ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv820hgaa6qnwx49ahf96zkh))
	- [Magnesium malate](https://thor.ne/AUUmc) can reduce soreness ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv820ry7q3wktxja14yvd00b))
	- Beet powder and juices increase vasodilation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv820x87fk36emk3r1cvjzdv))
