document_note:: Monetizing Innovation is a book that teaches how to design a product around the price, instead of the other way around. It provides nine new rules for innovation success, such as having a willingness to pay talk with customers early in the product development process, and asking questions to understand the perceived value the innovation holds for the customer. It also advocates using a maximization, penetration, or skimming pricing strategy, and understanding the customer's irrational sides, as well as providing tips on marketing and sales. It is an extremely practical book with excellent insights on why starting with price rather than product is an ideal way to go.

	- We've found recurring patterns in new product monetization failure. While you might think many types of flaws can cause products to flop in the marketplace, we actually have found that monetizing failures fall into only four categories:
	  
	  1.  Feature shock: cramming too many features into one product—sometimes even unwanted features—creates a product that does not fully resonate with customers and is often overpriced.
	  2.  Minivation: an innovation that, despite being the right product for the right market, is priced too low to achieve its full revenue potential.
	  3.  Hidden gem: a potential blockbuster product that is never properly brought to market, generally because it falls outside of the core business.
	  4.  Undead: an innovation that customers don't want but has nevertheless been brought to market, either because it was the wrong answer to the right question, or an answer to a question no one was asking.
	    1.  How do such undead products make it to market? They happen when their proponents wildly overstate the customer appeal and don't segment the customer base effectively. Had these firms asked customers what they'd be willing to pay for their inventions before drafting the engineering plans, and had they identified the market size by segment and who would be willing to pay the most (and least) for it, they would have reformulated their products to meet an acceptable price. Or, finding there is no acceptable price, or that the market size is too small, they would have scrapped the product altogether before they incurred too much financial damage.

		- **Note**: Monetizing innovation failures can be categorized into four categories: Feature shock, Minivation, Hidden gem, and Undead. Feature shock is when a product is overpriced due to too many features, Minivation is when a product is priced too low, Hidden gem is a potential successful product not brought to market, and Undead is a product with no customer demand. These failures can be avoided by asking customers what they would be willing to pay for a product and identifying the market size before creating the engineering plans.
	- **Have the “willingness to pay” talk with customers early in the product development process.** If you don't do it early, you won't be able to prioritize the product features you develop, and you won't know whether you're building something customers will pay for until it's in the marketplace.
	  
	  1.  The component company failed to ask this question: “What value does this component bring to our customer and its customers, and what portion of that value can we capture?” Instead, it asked, “What does this component cost to make, and what minimum margin do I need to add on top of that?”
	  2.  Understanding if customers are willing to pay for your invention, before you commit too many resources to building and launching it, will dramatically increase your likelihood of success. By designing your product around a price, your innovations will stand a far greater chance of surviving and thriving. Figuring how much customers will pay for your product when it is still in the concept stage will make your innovation process far more reliable. You and your company will be far more likely to succeed.
	  3.  Ask questions like “Do you value these products/features?” and then ask why. Then switch gears to ask questions like “What would you consider an acceptable price?” Switching from value to price is an easier transition to make in determining customer WTP.
	  4.  Avoid the “average trap: ”When you analyze the answers to your WTP questions, look at the distribution, not just the average response. The average response can be misleading. For instance, for two groups of customers, one willing to pay $20 and another willing to pay $100, if you calculated the average price they would pay, it would be $60. But that would leave money on the high side (the group that would pay $100) and make your product unaffordable to the low side (they'll only pay $20). You might be better off building the product to a $100 price point or—even better—making two versions, one at $20 (with different features or materials) and the other at $100. Either way, you must look at the distribution to arrive at the right insight, not just the averages. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrzajz15zc2ecnjyakcpk9v))
		- **Note**: This document outlines the importance of determining customer willingness to pay (WTP) when developing a new product. Companies should have conversations with customers early in the development process to prioritize product features and ensure that customers will pay for the product once it is released. Additionally, companies should ask questions about customer value and acceptable price points in order to gauge WTP. The average response may be misleading, and companies should look at the full distribution of responses when analyzing the data.
	- Don't force a one-size-fits-all solution. Whether you like it or not, your customers are different, so customer segmentation is crucial. But segmentation based on demographics—the primary way companies group their customers—is misleading. You should build segments based on differences in your customers' willingness to pay for your new product.
	  
	  1.  Most businesses do segmentation, but many are ineffective because of these three pitfalls: Segmenting too late.
	  2.  Segmenting only by observable characteristics.
	  3.  Having too many segmentation schemes.
	  4.  If you have more than three, you are headed for organizational confusion.
	  5.  Smart companies start with a few segments—three to four—and then expand gradually until they reach the optimal number.
	  6.  The message here is clear: You need to create segments in order to design highly attractive products for each segment. And you must base your segmentation on customers' needs, value, and WTP. This way, segmentation becomes a driver of product design and development, not an afterthought. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrzjsrbngawep2yf3wf86rf))
		- **Tags**: #[[customer segmentation]]
		- **Note**: Smart companies should not rely on one-size-fits-all solutions and should instead segment their customers based on differences in willingness to pay. This segmentation should focus on customers' needs, value, and willingness to pay (WTP). Companies should start with a few segments—three to four—and expand gradually in order to reach the optimal number, avoiding pitfalls such as segmenting too late, only by observable characteristics, and having too many segmentation schemes. This approach will enable companies to design highly attractive products for each segment.
	- Product configuration and bundling is more science than art. You need to build them carefully and match them with your most meaningful segments.
	  
	  1.  Our definition of product configuration refers to the decision of which features and functionalities will be included in a product. In some industries, like software and tech, product configuration is also referred to by the term packaging. By bundling, we mean combining a product or service with other products and services. Successful innovators get the product configuration and bundling decisions right from the start.
	  2.  Doing product configuration right means you design a product with the right features for a segment—that is, just the features customers are willing to pay for.
	  3.  Bundling helps you determine whether your products and/or services should be sold together or separately. When done right, it can increase total profit because customers end up buying more than they would have if you hadn't bundled. Take an example many are familiar with: McDonald's and its Value Meals.
	  4.  To determine what features you should bake into which product configuration, you should start by separating the must-have features from the nice-to-haves. On their own, nice-to-haves won't convince customers to buy a product. It's equally important to think about which features might turn off customers. Critical features—what we call leaders—are what drive customers to buy a product. Customers have high WTP for such leader features. Fillers are features of moderate importance or nice-to-haves. In contrast, killers are features that will blow the deal if the customer is forced to pay for them.
	  5.  Ideally, no more than a quarter of your customers should opt for the good option, while 70 percent should opt for the better or the best. Why does a well-crafted G/B/B configuration/bundle work? Because you can steer customers to a choice based on whether they are price conscious (good), quality conscious (best), or somewhere in between (better). The core philosophy behind a G/B/B is that a significant portion of people avoid extremes when they are presented a choice; they choose the compromise option.
	  6.  If more than 50 percent of your customers have bought your entry-level product, you most likely have this problem. If so, you should seriously consider removing features from your entry-level product. The ideal distribution of customers for a G/B/B product configuration strategy is 30 percent in good and 70 percent in better and best, with best being at least 10 percent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrzkvr685heh13xn442q494))
		- **Note**: Product configuration and bundling is an important part of innovation for companies to get right. Doing product configuration correctly means including features that customers are willing to pay for, and bundling products and services together can increase total profits. Companies can determine the features to include in a product by separating must-have features from nice-to-haves, and should also consider which features would turn off customers. A G/B/B (good, better, best) configuration/bundle works because it gives customers a choice between price conscious, quality conscious, or something in between. Ideally, the distribution of customers should be 30% in good and 70% in better and best, with best being at least 10%.

	- Building Block #1: Set Clear Goals
	  
	  1.  So which goals are most important for your new products? Revenue? Market share? Total profit? Profit margin? Customer lifetime value? Average revenue per unit? Something else? Whichever goals you choose, you cannot maximize all of them at the same time. In setting goals, you must make trade-offs. Here's an example: Assume you could sell your product at either $10 or $15. Further assume when you sell your product at $10, you get 100 customers, and when you sell it at $15, you get 80 customers. So how should you price your product? Will you take 20 percent fewer customers in return for a 20 percent increase in revenue? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrzn8wtpkypyghtqtrse6fr))
		- **Note**: When creating goals for a new product, you have to decide what you want to focus on. For example, do you want to make more money, get more customers, or have a bigger profit? You can't do all of these things at the same time. For example, if you sell your product for $10, you might get 100 customers, but if you sell for $15, you might only get 80 customers. So, should you make more money even though you get fewer customers? You have to decide.
	- Building Block #2: Pick the Right Type of Pricing Strategy
	  
	  1.  The good news is only three types of pricing strategies matter: maximization, penetration, and skimming. Let's look at each.
	    1.  Maximization: This strategy maximizes your goal (such as profit or revenue) in the short term.
	    2.  Penetration: With this pricing strategy, you intentionally price your product lower than in a maximization strategy to rapidly gain market share. This is also known as a land-and-expand strategy.
	        1.  Facebook has become immensely profitable as well, generating $7 billion in profits in aggregate from 2009 to the first half of 2015. A penetration strategy might be right if you also plan to hike prices in the future.
	    3.  Skimming: Here you first cater to customers with a higher WTP—the early adopters. Then, you systematically decrease price in order to reach other customer segments with lower willingness to pay. Your initial price needs to be higher than the price you would have charged had you chosen a maximization strategy. A skimming strategy is especially appropriate if you have a significant number of customers who are willing to pay a higher price than others for your product. Put another way, your customers' WTP varies greatly between early adopters and late followers. Some prime examples are buyers of movies, music, online games, high-definition TVs, gaming consoles (such as Microsoft's Xbox video game console), smartphones (Apple iPhone, for example), and some automobiles. These customers won't wait for a product to become mainstream. It gives them bragging rights; they want to show it off to their peers. Two other scenarios make skimming the right choice. One is when the product represents a breakthrough—an offering that delivers far superior value. The other scenario is when you have production capacity constraints in the initial launch periods but must mass produce in the future. A classic way to implement skimming is by combining product and pricing actions. Here's how this works: You launch the higher-end product first, skim the market, and then launch lower-end products.

		- **Note**: This document outlines three main types of pricing strategies: maximization, penetration, and skimming. Maximization maximizes short-term goals such as profit or revenue, penetration prices the product lower to rapidly gain market share, and skimming prices the product higher to cater to customers with higher willingness to pay, then systematically decrease the price to reach other segments. Skimming can be combined with product and pricing actions to launch the higher-end product first and then launch lower-end products.
	- Develop Principles for Reaction
	  
	  1.  Price reaction principles come in two varieties: those based on how customers behave (such as promotional reactions due to lower-than-expected demand) and those based on how competitors behave with their prices. Planning your reactions is much like playing chess and thinking a few moves ahead. Companies that don't think ahead react spontaneously and make unintentional yet avoidable mistakes.
	  2.  Or you could skimp on promotions because you've chosen a premium strategy (like Apple). Or you might do something in between. The most important aspect of promotional reactions is to decide early which principles you will base them on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrzsgevg3nzd6pzm6rc2yfx))
		- **Note**: Companies should plan their pricing reactions in advance, like playing chess, to avoid making unintentional mistakes. Deciding which principles to base the reactions on is important, such as whether to focus on customer behavior or competitor behavior. Companies can also choose a premium strategy, like Apple, or something in between.
	- The most important input for optimizing your price is the price elasticity curve (also known as the demand curve and price–demand relationship). It shows how much the sales volume of your product decreases and increases if you move your price up or down: Price Elasticity = Change in Sales (%)/Change in Price (%) To calculate the price elasticity and profit curve for your new product, you need two sources of data: your analysis of what customers are willing to pay (discussed in Chapter 4) and your costs (both variable and fixed). Everything else is simple math. Here's ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gss04y8g49mtrhdrkgjjkcx2))
		- **Note**: The most important part of deciding how much to charge for your product is the price elasticity curve. This shows how much more or less people will buy your product if you change the price. To figure out the price elasticity and the amount of profit your product will make, you need two pieces of data. One is how much people are willing to pay for it. The other is how much it costs to make. You just need to do some simple math to put it all together.
	- •   As management guru Peter Drucker once said: “Customers don't buy products. They buy the benefits that these products and their suppliers offer to them.”
	  •   **How can you maximize your acquisition success? You need to start by articulating benefits—not features—and focus on the most important ones. You need to speak the customer's language, not your language. Finally, you need to get your marketing and sales teams involved early in the product development process.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gss05qdt3e5y5631hfyr6pvj))
		- **Note**: In order to maximize acquisition success, it is important to articulate benefits instead of features, focus on the most important ones, speak the customer's language, and involve the marketing and sales teams early in the product development process. This will ensure that customers are buying the benefits offered by the product and its suppliers.
	- Communicate the value of your offering clearly and compellingly; otherwise you will not get customers to pay full measure.
	  
	  1.  **Features, not benefits**
	  2.  The benefit statements, such as “beautiful design” and “unlimited storage,” were music to many ears. The average customer could now quickly understand what they would get with each product offering. If you wanted only photo storage, you would choose basic. Want personalization? Choose power. Did you want to sell online? Choose portfolio. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gss07cygxajwx4y4zyqqypb7))
		- **Note**: This document outlines the importance of communicating the value of a product offering clearly and compellingly in order to get customers to pay full measure. It suggests that features should be highlighted instead of the benefits, and to provide customers with a clear understanding of what they will get with each product offering. For example, if a customer wanted only photo storage, they could choose the "basic" product, while if they wanted personalization they could choose "power" and if they wanted to sell online, they could choose "portfolio".
	- The Three Steps to Create Great Value Communications
	  
	  1.  Step 1: Develop Crystal-Clear Benefit Statements—Not Feature Descriptions
	    1.  Value is a measure of the benefit to the customer. Communicate benefits, not features. Take each feature and ask yourself this: What does the customer achieve because of this feature? If you are still unsure about how to phrase your product's benefits, probe your customers about their pain points and how your product would solve them. Ideally, you should understand how customers measure their performance—and how your offering would affect those measures. Once you know that, you can tailor your messages to the customers' priorities. You should also quantify the relative value of your product: the value it would deliver compared to the value your customer gets today from other offerings. To
	    2.  Matrix of Competitive Advantages (MOCA) To create this matrix, you list the relative importance of your innovation's benefits to customers on the y-axis. On the x-axis, you rate your innovation's performance against the competition—not as you see it, but as your customers see it. The benefits your product delivers that are most important to customers and that competitors can't match (top right quadrant) are the ones to emphasize in your sales and marketing messages. But those aren't the only benefits to communicate. For the ones in the lower right quadrant—benefits you are better at delivering than competitors but which are less important to customers—you are trying to convince customers these benefits are more important than they might realize. However, if you can't prove it, don't emphasize them in your value communication. The factors in the top left quadrant represent your competitive disadvantages, and you should prepare arguments to defend them. Using this matrix, creating value communications will become more structured. It will also become easier to get all the innovation team members (R&D,

	  3.  Step 3: Measure the Impact and Refine Your Value Messages ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gss09rmqyjrzwd1834dhc4wj))
		- **Note**: Monetizing innovation involves creating effective value communications which focus on the benefits to the customer. This involves developing crystal-clear benefit statements, making the statements segment-specific, and measuring the impact of the messaging. To do this, companies should focus on the customer's pain points and how the product would solve them. Additionally, companies should create a Matrix of Competitive Advantages to identify the benefits that are most important to customers and that competitors can't match, as well as any competitive disadvantages. Finally, companies should measure the impact of their messaging and refine their value messages accordingly.
	- •   Compromise effect: Make decisions easier for people who can't choose.
	    1.  When given a set of choices, people will avoid extremes.
	  •   Anchoring tactics: Set the context for value. We illustrated two examples of anchoring—the movie theater concessions and the Internet start-up company. Anchors make the other options look attractive.
	    1.  Make sure you have an anchor product in your new product offering portfolio, and start every B2B sales negotiation for new products with a high anchor price.
	  •   Using price to signal quality: If it costs more, it reinforces the customer's perception of quality.
	  •   Razor/razor blades: Get a foot in the door. Customers are influenced by costs that are immediately in front of them. Even if they calculate their total cost of ownership of a product over time, they will be swayed by the initial costs.
	    1.  The customer's upfront cost has a much bigger psychological impact than the total cost of ownership. Your pricing strategy should be to land a customer by showcasing the lower upfront costs and then expanding on a higher variable amount.
	  •   Pennies-a-day pricing: Reduce sticker shock and build loyalty.
	    1.  Instead of displaying prices in the hundreds or thousands of dollars per server, EC2 shows prices in dollars or even fractions of a penny for hourly prices. Aside from fundamentally changing your business model to be like Amazon's, are there easier ways to use pennies-a-day pricing? Absolutely. And the simplest is breaking up time.
	  •   Psychological price thresholds: Avoid falling off the price cliffs. You might wonder why you rarely see prices like $101 in retail; you almost always see $99 or $99.99. The reason is that customers typically have price thresholds in mind.
	    1.  Recommendation: Identify the price thresholds for your products and stay on the cliff.
	  •   For online offers, controlled A/B tests let you assess click-through and conversion rates on different behavioral pricing tactics. They give you statistically significant data on the options with the best outcomes. But you must set up these tests correctly, which includes clearly defining your control and test cases. You must also divide the sample in each group so the customer populations are similar. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gss0byx568r55798yyt7671b))
		- **Note**: Monetizing Innovation is a strategy of designing a product around its price. This includes using the compromise effect, anchoring tactics, using price to signal quality, razor/razor blades, pennies-a-day pricing, and psychological price thresholds. Online offers can be tested through A/B testing to assess click-through and conversion rates. It is important to clearly define the control and test cases, and to divide the sample in each group so the customer populations are similar.
	- Paid pilots: Instead of giving the product to beta-testers for free, LinkedIn typically goes to market and sells the beta version of the product. Why? It provides another layer of validation for the monetizing potential of the new service based on the value delivered. In the words of Josh Gold, “Our beta users have skin in the game by actually paying for the pilot tests.” And there is a clear impact of having skin in the game: It generates better concept-testing feedback from the testers. It also allows LinkedIn to fine-tune the price levels prior to a full go-to-market launch. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gss0djztptk5sxtgtthxnx17))
	- “By doing such voice-of-the-customer research, you can ‘test-sell’ your product even though you haven't even started the product development process yet,” Drews says. “Then, when the customer asks when he can have it, you know you created a very powerful product idea.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gss0e0rs9wkcy5brj9kge033))
