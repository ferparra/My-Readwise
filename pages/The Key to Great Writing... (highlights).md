		- **Note**: Thread
	- Language is a free way to be strategic.
	  
	  The right words can make you warmer, more authoritative, and more effective.
	  
	  The wrong words can make you seem negative, passive, or confrontational.
	  
	  These are 7 words to start deleting today: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1462105956091846662))
	- 1. Fine
	  
	  Saying fine sounds like you’re not fine. When writing, you only have cold hard text--you can’t use facial expressions to show warmth.
	  
	  You need to amp up the positivity to compensate.
	  
	  🚫 “I’m fine with that.”
	  
	  ✅ “Great, I’m on board.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1462105962240786441))
	- 2. However
	  
	  ‘However’ is a melodramatic way to say ‘but.’ It’s too formal and bureaucratic.
	  
	  🚫 “It should take an hour each day. However, you can do your work on your own schedule.”
	  
	  ✅ “It should take an hour each day. You can do most of your work on your own schedule.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1462105964199530498))
	- 3. Unfortunately
	  
	  Don’t make bad news seem heavier than it needs to be.
	  
	  🚫 “Unfortunately we only offer the event on X dates, but recordings are sent the next day.”
	  
	  ✅ “Absolutely. Events are only scheduled on X dates & recordings are sent the next day.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1462105971002683417))
	- 4. Double negatives
	  
	  When you say “not,” your reader has to think of what is--then think of the opposite. 
	  
	  Make it easier for people to understand you: state things in the affirmative as your default.
	  
	  🚫 “I could not be more proud to...”
	  
	  ✅ “I am incredibly proud to...” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1462105973359788033))
	- 5. Can’t until
	  
	  Don’t state what you can’t do. State what you CAN do.
	  
	  🚫 “I can’t meet until 2pm.”
	  
	  ✅ “I can meet at 2pm and anytime after.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1462105975993909249))
	- 6. Honestly
	  
	  Let’s assume your default is to tell the truth.
	  
	  🚫 “To be honest, I don’t think that’s a good idea.”
	  
	  ✅ “I don’t think that’s a good idea.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1462105977835114503))
	- 7. Very, truly, and really
	  
	  These can sound generic. You’ll come across just as sincere (if not more so) without them.
	  
	  🚫 “I really appreciate you and am truly glad to be part of the team.”
	  
	  ✅ “I appreciate you and am honored to be part of the team.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1462105979839995919))
	- “Writing is more like a sculpture where you remove, you eliminate in order to make the work visible.” - Elie Wiesel
	  
	  Keep an eye out for these words--they’ll subconsciously creep into your writing. Luckily they’re easy to delete & will make your writing stronger right away. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1462105986009903104))
