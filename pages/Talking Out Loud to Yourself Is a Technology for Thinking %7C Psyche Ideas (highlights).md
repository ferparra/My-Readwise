	- Speaking out loud, by contrast, allows the retrieval of our thoughts in full, using rhythm and intonation that emphasise their pragmatic and argumentative meaning, and encourages the creation of developed, complex ideas
	- triggers new mental and linguistic connections
	- speaking to ourselves encourages us to actively construct an image of an addressee and activate one’s ‘theory of mind’
	- By forcing us to articulate ourselves more fully, self-talk summons up the image of an imagined listener or interrogator more vividly
	- evidence shows that movement enhances thinking and learning, and both are activated in the same centre of motor control in the brain
	- playing a musical instrument, writing, speaking or dancing don’t start in the brain and then emanate out to the body as actions; rather, they entail the mind and body working in concert as a creative, integrated whole, unfolding and influencing each other in turn
