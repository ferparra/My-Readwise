	- Step 1. Create Notes Of Topics You're Thinking About
	  
	  It's important to be intentional about what you're tackling so start by making notes/nodes of things that are top of mind so you can have a place to compile ideas you uncover around those ideas. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jevy/status/1483767559283482624))

	- Story: After a few meetings, I had gold nuggets of context on that tech support issue with some really good ideas for tackling it. All generated from other people, in meetings where this was a side topic.
	  
	  Go forth and crush strategically! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jevy/status/1483767569618194435))
