document_note:: This text explains why the world appears to be so boring. It is suggested that people act in a boring manner in public because they are vulnerable to social predators who look for chances to gain social credit by taking them down. It is also argued that it takes unusual art, allies and energy to survive while choosing to be lively in public. As a result, most people opt to either act boring in order to avoid being attacked, or act in an outraged manner and become a social bandit themselves.

	- The degree of this danger is made clear, I think by the reaction of the “gods” among us. The public tone of huge powerful firms and other orgs is consistently “officious”, i.e., mild boring supplication. They don’t dare act lively or passionate or opinionated, for fear of suffering devastating criticism from those predatory social bandits.
