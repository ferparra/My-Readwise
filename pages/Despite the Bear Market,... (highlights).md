	- Despite the bear market, product salaries are the highest I‚Äôve ever seenüî•üî•üî•
	  
	  PM: $170K*
	  Sr PM: $207K*
	  Principal PM: $274K*
	  
	  Here are 5 things I did when breaking into Product: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1546939914045906944))

	- * Data is from the @pavecomp team who shared comp numbers on Linkedin during their recent fundraising announcement a few weeks back. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1546939916076072960))
	- 1/ Networking
	  
	  Tech is annoyingly network-based. Warm intros & referrals help ensure you at least get a phone screen. If you don‚Äôt know anyone, cold reach out to employees to learn more. They‚Äôre incentivized to reply bc they get a referral bonus too. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1546939917711732737))
	- 2/ Partner w Product
	  
	  Most functions have a need to aggregate & surface data back to Product. Look through insights, pain points and feature requests and synthesize what‚Äôs most important. Set up a bi-weekly to meet with the PM, be their ‚Äúeyes and ears‚Äù & learn from them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1546939918982688768))
	- 3/ Interview Prep
	  
	  PM interviews are their own kind of beast. There are specific Qs asked, frameworks used and ways to answer Qs that show PM-potential.
	  
	  Drop a comment if a thread on answering common product questions would be helpful. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1546939920068947969))
	- 4a/ Internal Transfer
	  
	  When I hired an APM, I supported an internal transfer from Ops. She was sharp, eager, had high PM potential & already knew the business/product. 
	  
	  Onboarding & hiring is expensive. Companies should be incentivized to keep strong talent. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1546939921151078405))
	- 4b/ Internal Transfer
	  
	  Ofc, in practice many managers & companies aren‚Äôt supportive of internal transfers. They want to keep you in your current position otherwise they need to backfill you (instead of support you in your career). 
	  
	  In which case, see point 5. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1546939923294404608))
	- 5/ Consider a Startup
	  
	  Big companies usually req product experience. Smaller startups usually look for product-minded, high potential ppl who can wear many hats. 
	  
	  Picking the right startup is key. The good & bad experiences are magnified in a small, fast-paced setting. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1546939924410118145))
