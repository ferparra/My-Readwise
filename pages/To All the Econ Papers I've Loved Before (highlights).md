	- How to Make the Best Choices
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Context is important when making choices, and different contexts can lead to different choices., * Belinda's experience of moving to the US and becoming low-income showed her how important context is to the way we make choices.)

	  So this is what they did. They got 800 churchgoers and randomly divided them into groups. And in one of those groups, they were given real insurance. The insurance was for funeral costs, which are quite expensive in Ghana. And the authors found that the people who got free funeral insurance, they would spend less money, less money on God, on things like church donations and charities than the people who weren't given the insurance.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So the paper says insurance premiums and church donations. There may be both ways of trying to buy protection from risk. The fancy way to say this is that they are economic substitutes.
	  
	  Speaker 5
	  It's a substitution away from giving to the church and towards formal insurance when you have this market available. So anyway, I love this paper. It's a brilliant paper. I think it's brilliantly done from beginning to end.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  Belinda loves this paper not just because it's clever and interesting, but because it shows how important context is to the way that we make choices. She says, if you look at the world through the lens of economics, people will start to look really similar.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  We're all just economic actors trying to make the best decisions we can.
	  
	  Speaker 5
	  It's not that people are necessarily strange or weird or somehow culturally, you know, unknowable. People are acting in ways that are actually very rational, given their constraints and given their environment and given their context.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  And if you change that context, the kinds of choices we might make are going to change too.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Belinda has experienced this personally. When she was 12, her family moved from Nigeria to the US, and in Nigeria, they had been middle class. Her mom was a lawyer, but when they moved here, her mom couldn't use her law degree anymore.
	  
	  Speaker 5
	  We were quite low-income in the US, quite struggling financially. And 12 of you all mean this makes no sense. Belinda and her family were still the same people.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  They hadn't changed, but all of a sudden, they were in a different place with totally different lives.
	  
	  Speaker 5
	  It really drove home to me just the strangeness of the way in which just arbitrary things about you, you know, that you don't control. You feel like you don't control where you're born, you know, what parents you're born to, your ethnicity or race. Like, these kind of things that you did not choose about you can affect significantly your outcome. ([TimeÂ 0:08:41](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5f0f4104-015e-4226-a931-5a3478039880))
