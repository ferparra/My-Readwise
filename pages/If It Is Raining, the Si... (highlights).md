	- If it is raining, the sidewalk is wet.
	  
	  If the sidewalk is wet, is it raining? Not necessarily. Yet, we are inclined to think so. This is a preposterously common logical fallacy called "affirming the consequent".
	  
	  However, it is not totally wrong. Why? Enter the Bayes theorem.

	- Propositions of the form "if A, then B" are called implications.
	  
	  They are written as "A → B", and they form the bulk of our scientific knowledge.
	  
	  Say, "if X is a closed system, then the entropy of X cannot decrease" is the 2nd law of thermodynamics. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TivadarDanka/status/1598298385185841153))
	- In the implication A → B, the proposition A is called "premise", while B is called the "conclusion".
	  
	  The premise implies the conclusion, but not the other way around.
	  
	  If you observe a wet sidewalk, it is not necessarily raining. Someone might have spilled a barrel of water. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TivadarDanka/status/1598298387740127232))
	- Let's talk about probability!
	  
	  Probability is an extension of classical logic, where the analogue of implication is the conditional probability.

	- The closer P(B | A) to 1, the more likely B (the conclusion) becomes when observing A (the premise).

	- The Bayes theorem expresses P(A | B),  the likelihood of the premise given that the conclusion is observed.
	  
	  What's best: it relates P(A | B) to P(B | A). That is, it tells us if we can "affirm the consequent" or not!

	- Suppose that the conclusion B undoubtedly follows from the premise A. (That is, P(B |A) = 1.)
	  
	  How likely is the other way around? The Bayes theorem gives us an answer.

	- Thus, when we take a glimpse at the sidewalk outside and see that it is soaking wet, it is safe to assume that it's raining.
	  
	  The other explanations are fairly rare.
