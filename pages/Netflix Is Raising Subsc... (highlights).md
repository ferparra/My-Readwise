- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- Netflix is raising subscription pricing by 13% to 18%. The most popular subscription will be $13 per month (up from $11 per month). Price increases will roll out to existing subscribers over the next three months. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/neilcybart/status/1085184091962724352))

	- [[Netflix]] gradually increasing subscription [[pricing]] is not surprising. The company has no choice but to raise prices. The additional cash flow is needed to fund original content. Simply growing the number of users isn't enough. https://t.co/NiTDyTaIIf

	- I don't think pricing / user growth is Netflix's problem. Instead, the largest risk is found w/ subscriber engagement. If engagement falls due to competition (Disney being the big one, but Amazon, WarnerMedia, Apple as well), the Netflix feedback loop breaks apart.

	- Why did Netflix increase prices just before major competition enters the scene? They have no other choice. Netflix needs more content.
