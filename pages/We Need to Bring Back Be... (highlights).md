	  This is one of the cleanest, most flavorful, and most versatile cooking oils out there. 
	  
	  Here's what you need to know to source it and cook with it.

	- What is tallow? 
	  
	  Tallow is beef fat that has been rendered. 
	  
	  Bits of fat are slowly cooked until they melt, the solids are filtered out, and you're left with a beautiful, fatty golden oil that's full of nutrients and perfect for cooking.

	- Sourcing:
	  
	  Whenever possible, you should strive for tallow from grass-fed, grass-finished animals. 
	  
	  Ask around at your local farmer's market or butcher, and buy locally if you can. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/myles_cooks/status/1595504586361475072))
	- The best tallow comes from the fat around the kidneys of the animal. This is called suet. 
	  
	  Sometimes it will be labeled as rendered suet or beef kidney fat. 
	  
	  Tallow can be made from fat from other parts of the animal and is still good. But kidney fat is the most nutritious. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/myles_cooks/status/1595504588349911040))
	- There are some great options to buy online, as well. 
	  
	  I buy my tallow (and other animal fats) from Fatworks. Their sourcing is great and the product is fantastic. 
	  
	  You can also find them on Amazon (both links below)

	- What can you cook with tallow? 
	  
	  Basically anything. 
	  
	  Most tallow has a pretty neutral flavor, especially when heated. 
	  
	  Almost any time a recipe calls for vegetable oil, you can replace it with tallow. 
	  
	  Think of it as an everyday kitchen staple, along with your olive oil. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/myles_cooks/status/1595504592548429824))
	- It also adds a subtle richness and delicious flavor to foods. This makes it great for roasting potatoes and other vegetables. 
	  
	  A simple recipe: Melted tallow + vegetables + salt + aromatics. Roast at high heat until cooked. Extremely versatile and delicious. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/myles_cooks/status/1595504594880057345))
	- Tallow has a high smoke point, so you can use it for high-heat cooking. 
	  
	  Any time I want to sear meat or deep-fry something, I use tallow. 
	  
	  Tallow is great as an everyday cooking oil, but it's especially useful for searing, roasting, and frying. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/myles_cooks/status/1595504596293537792))
	- Some fun ways to use it:
	- Storage: 
	  
	  I like to keep tallow in a sealed glass jar. It will keep at room temp for about a year. I always go through it well before then. 
	  
	  This keeps the tallow soft and easy to use. But if you prefer you can store it in the fridge. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/myles_cooks/status/1595504600554999808))
	- Tallow is solid at room temp and melts when heated. 
	  
	  If I need it melted I'll just add a few spoonfuls to a small saucepan like this and melt it down to a liquid before I use it.

	- Some cool things I've cooked with tallow recently:
	- stuffed poblano chiles fried in tallow
	- As you can see, tallow is extremely versatile. 
	  
	  Not only will it make your food taste delicious, but you'll FEEL great after eating it. 
	  
	  Give it a try in your own kitchen, and let me know if you have any questions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/myles_cooks/status/1595504607471362051))
