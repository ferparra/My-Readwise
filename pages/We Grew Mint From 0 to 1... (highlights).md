	- We grew Mint from 0 to 1 million users in 6 months.
	  
	  2 years later, Mint sold for $170 million. 
	  
	  Here's how we got those first million usersðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/noahkagan/status/1407332945166221314))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- But before I get there, here's the quick background:
	  
	  â€¢ I joined as employee #4
	  â€¢ #1 personal finance tracker
	  â€¢ Mint sold to Intuit for $170M in 2009 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/noahkagan/status/1407332945950658564))
	- I found Mint and was like...
	  
	  "HEY this is dope!"
	  
	  So I pitched the founder on why I should be his Director of Marketing. 
	  
	  He laughed at me. 
	  
	  "You've never even worked in marketing."
	  
	  Good point. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/noahkagan/status/1407332948798590976))
	- But I wrote out a 6-month Mint marketing plan and launch strategy.
	  
	  He hired me on the spot.
	  
	  If you want a job, show don't tell. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/noahkagan/status/1407332949725437952))
	- We had a problem though. 
	  
	  We had no product and 0 users.
	  
	  My 1st job?
	  
	  Get 100,000 users in 6 months. 
	  
	  Here's how we did it: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/noahkagan/status/1407332950560194562))
	- Step 1: Deadlines are everything
	  
	  Yes, your 5th grade Math teacher was right.
	  
	  I also learned this from Zuckerberg. 
	  
	  â†’ Always set measurable deadlines
	  
	  For Mint: 100K users in 6 months
	  
	  Then you can reverse engineer how to get there. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/noahkagan/status/1407332952455979012))
	- Step 2: Who is the customer? 
	  
	  Ok, you're probably thinking @noahkagan this one is obvious!
	  
	  Everyone is the customer because everyone wants more money. 
	  
	  Wrong. 
	  
	  You need to make this super specific. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/noahkagan/status/1407332953911332877))
	- So I went to a million coffee shops and asked people questions.  
	  
	  Examples: 
	  
	  â€¢ Current financial strategy?
	  â€¢ Need help with most of your finances?
	  â€¢ How would your ideal personal finance tool work? 
	  
	  Our target customer: Young professionals + personal finance nerds ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/noahkagan/status/1407332955048054792))
	- Step 3: Make No Product Look Sexy
	  
	  We didn't even have a product. 
	  
	  But I needed to build hype somehow. 
	  
	  Hype = Collect emails from people that fit our demographic
	  
	  Here's how we did this: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/noahkagan/status/1407332956654424070))
	- 1) Monthly newsletter with financial tips
	  
	  2) Content marketing aka Blogging
	  
	  Our target customers loved personal finance blogs.
	  
	  But very few startups were blogging at the time. 
	  
	  So we built a blog with articles they'd love.

	- 3) Can I pay you $1,000? 
	  
	  At the time, no one was sponsoring smaller finance blogs. 
	  
	  So I'd email the writers with sponsorship offers for $1,000.
	  
	  It worked well and drove lots of email sign-ups. 
	  
	  Lesson: Search for undervalued marketing channels ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/noahkagan/status/1407332961331159047))
	- The result? 
	  
	  When we launched we had 100,000 people on our email list. 
	  
	  In 6 months, we crushed our 100K goal to the tune of 1 million users. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/noahkagan/status/1407332962241331212))
	- Retweet the 1st tweet give an internet friend the tools to jumpstart their next biz:

	- To recap: 
	  
	  1) Set measurable deadlines 
	  
	  2) Talk to customers: who are they and what is the problem?
	  
	  3) Build hype (or collect emails) by targeting places where they hang out online 
	  
	  Bonus: Use undervalued marketing channels like niche influencers ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/noahkagan/status/1407333724019171338))
