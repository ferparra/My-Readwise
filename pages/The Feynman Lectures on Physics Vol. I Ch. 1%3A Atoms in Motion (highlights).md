	- The atoms are
	  so small that you cannot see them with a light microscope—in fact, not
	  even with an electron microscope. (With a light microscope you
	  can only see things which are much bigger.) Now if the atoms are always
	  in motion, say in water, and we put a big ball of something in the
	  water, a ball much bigger than the atoms, the ball will jiggle
	  around—much as in a push ball game, where a great big ball is pushed
	  around by a lot of people. The people are pushing in various directions,
	  and the ball moves around the field in an irregular fashion. So, in the
	  same way, the “large ball” will move because of the inequalities of
	  the collisions on one side to the other, from one moment to the next.
	  Therefore, if we look at very tiny particles (colloids) in water through
	  an excellent microscope, we see a perpetual jiggling of the particles,
	  which is the result of the bombardment of the atoms. This is called the
	  Brownian motion.
