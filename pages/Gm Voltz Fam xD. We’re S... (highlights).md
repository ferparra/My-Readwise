	- gm voltz fam xD. Weâ€™re SO excited to announce our $6m Seed round, to bring interest rate swaps to DeFi through a novel AMM thatâ€™s up to 3,000x more capital efficient than alternative models ðŸ’¥.

	- 1/ Voltz is a noncustodial automated market maker for interest rate swaps. Voltz uses a concentrated liquidity virtual AMM (vAMM) for price discovery only, with the management of the underlying assets performed by the Margin Engine.

	- 2/ The combined impact of these modules enables counterparties to create and trade fixed and variable rates through a mechanism that is up to 3,000x more capital efficient than alternative interest rate swap models. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/VoltzProtocol/status/1468585087365230592))
	- 3/ The Voltz Margin Engine defines the leverage available to traders and liquidity providers and manages the collateralization of the protocol. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/VoltzProtocol/status/1468585088820682756))
	- 4/ Voltz IRS pools are synthetic, meaning the underlying yield-bearing positions arenâ€™t required to enter into an IRS contract. This means traders only have to deposit margin to trade rates and can do so with >10x leverage. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/VoltzProtocol/status/1468585090309574665))
	- 5/ This also means Voltz IRS markets can be >10x larger than the TVL in the underlying rates markets, as seen with derivative markets in TradFi. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/VoltzProtocol/status/1468585091731501065))
	- 6/ Significantly, the concentrated liquidity constant product invariant behind the vAMM establishes a market-driven fixed rate that removes the silos between fixed and variable rates. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/VoltzProtocol/status/1468585093082062854))
	- 7/ As another first, LPs are only required to deposit a single asset type (e.g. DAI) to create both sides of the market - since rate payments, whether fixed or variable, are always made in the same underlying asset. Single asset LPing will be a game changer for DeFi. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/VoltzProtocol/status/1468585094562656258))
	- 8/ Due to the synthetic nature of pools, an IRS market can be created on top of any asset with a variable rate of return. Making Voltz a generalisable AMM that can unlock a new wave of innovations and primitives in DeFi. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/VoltzProtocol/status/1468585095967690752))
	- 9/ The synthetic nature also means any asset with a variable rate of return can easily be turned into a fixed rate asset via a Voltz IRS pool. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/VoltzProtocol/status/1468585097339318278))
	- 10/ Traders can get exposure to rates with >10x leverage. And LPs that deposit liquidity into tick ranges, with balanced fixed and variable trading volumes, can generate APYs of >200%. More analysis of this can be found in the Voltz Litepaper. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/VoltzProtocol/status/1468585098736025604))
