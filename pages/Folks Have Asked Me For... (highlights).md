	- Folks have asked me for references on the ML perspective on [[causal inference]]. Here are two good ones:
	  
	  1. @matheusfacure's book "[[Causal Inference]] for the Brave and the True" (Part II) https://t.co/kdNpZLYXuH
	  
	  2. @CasualBrady's lecture notes (Chapter 7) https://t.co/FFmN6NlYau ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor/status/1427653859569115139))

	- Why this is important for working data scientists: Typically in [[causal inference]], researchers try to estimate some quantity of interest one time for a publication. In industry, we must build systems to reliably estimate  quantities, at scale, over time, for a variety of contexts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor/status/1427655093378183170))
	- This move some producing some *estimates* to a *machine that produces estimates* is a large jump in complexity, requirements, and risk. It highlights that applied causal inference is also a data collection and software problem. Lessons that we've learned in other ML research.

	- Why is causal inference different from ML? We've built tools/intuition for lowering MSE of estimates in prediction tasks. My perspective: the main difference for causal inference we need to consider a different source of bias that we can't mitigate in the ways we've been trained.
