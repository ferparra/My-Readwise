	- @MihailoBjelic @dankrad @BTCeurope @Quiveringsphinx @loopringorg Miners/stakers are ONLY responsible for time ordering of transactions *within the bounds of the state transition function*. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1395736225915494405))
	- I'm quite skeptical that this MEV-auction-based design has any chance in the marketplace of rollups. 
	  
	  So you donate all revenue from running the sequencer to public goods? That's a heartwarming story, but as a user, I will always stick with rollups that kick the MEV back to me. https://t.co/zMqNeS3Zw9 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1417502023147266049))
	- Success is a muscle.
	  
	  Every important upgrade that Ethereum has successfully merged (Beacon Chain, now 1559) increases the chance that future important upgrades (The Merge, sharding, block proposer/builder separation) will be also successful. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1423295802705735686))
	- When a UTXO is modified, it is destroyed and created again with new state. So if multiple txns compete to modify the same UTXO (e.g. a Uniswap pool), then only one txn can succeed and all others will fail. https://t.co/D8NHzM3X7q ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1434464436471930884))
