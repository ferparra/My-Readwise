document_note:: Brian Grazer is a successful movie producer who attributes his success to his curiosity. He uses curiosity conversations to learn about the world and stories of others. He initially used his job as a law clerk to ask questions and for advice, but not for anything else. Curiosity can be a powerful tool, but it is often suppressed in society. Grazer recommends meeting one new person a day and speaking to outliers, anomalies, and the best in their field to learn from them. He also advises to not be afraid of asking questions and to not settle for good enough. Curiosity can help people to connect with others, be a good boss, and be intimate with others.
