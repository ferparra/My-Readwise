	- Atlassian published their postmorten on JIRA, Confluence, and other sites down for ~400 companies for up to 2 weeks.
	  
	  I'm not happy with the postmortem, as they are hiding the number of actual impacted seats/users. As per my research, 50,000-800,000 users were impacted.

	- Atlassian offered for me to review the postmortem before publishing, which they then walked back on. I told them ahead of time the one thing I would expect: to publish the number of impacted users/seats.
	  
	  They did not do this. They told me it's more than 50,000 users though. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1520549685144043520))
	- The full postmortem is here: https://t.co/pDv7k4CMyX
	  
	  I can't take a company seriously that is playing hide-and seek with the numbers though.
	  
	  For a more accurate overview of the customer impact, sadly, my writeup during the outage is still much better: https://t.co/K5zt5pIVyt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1520550012710707200))
	- Atlassian uses the term "customer" as it was just one person.
	  
	  Heck not. I talked with closer to a dozen of impacted "customers". Each one a company with 250-2,000 people unable to use JIRA / Confluence and not knowing what is happening. All of them very upset at the time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1520550259247702016))
	- For the bar of what owing up to the outage looks like, take a look at this by @gitlab. All stats are public: https://t.co/P43k4iuE77
	  
	  Atlassian is several levels below GitLab.
	  
	  And yes, I sent them this example ahead of time.
	  
	  My impression of transparency at @Atlassian ðŸ‘Ž ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1520550828368613376))
	- Also, as I could not comment the post-mortem ahead of publishing, Iâ€™m doing it now.
	  
	  The post-mortem does a poor job not calling out the exact systems that were down, nor having no action items to prioritise OpsGenie SLAs. OpsGenie down was unacceptable.
