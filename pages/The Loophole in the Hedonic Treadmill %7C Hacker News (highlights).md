	- If you think in survivalistic terms, the most powerful position to be in is one where others need you (and therefore you have high social capital) but you don't need them (so you could walk away if you wanted). This is actually autonomy, not power, but otherwise the people around you might experience the repercussions of your decisions as power.
	- Another loophole is to always treasure what you have.  I bought a 2009 Hyundai Santa Fe in 2009 because I really enjoyed the car I test drove.  I still drive that car today with 135K miles on it.  At least once a week, when I get in, I try to think "I really like this car."  Even though it's now 7 years old, starting to get creaky and long ago lost the new car smell, I try to remember what it was like to really enjoy the car.  By doing this regularly, I have been able to prevent some of the effects of hedonic accustomization.

	- Capitalism is not the idea that you buy happiness. It's the idea that you freely trade with others to get items you need.It creates abundance - even overabundance for some - and then one can choose what level of consumption they want. Less buying = higher savings = more capital or leisure time so capitalism can actually encourage savings.
