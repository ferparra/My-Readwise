	- This is why we’re here. To fight through the pain and, when possible, to relieve the pain of others. So simple. So hard to see. ([Location 5343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003062GEE&location=5343))
	- No matter where you are in life, there is always more journey ahead. And I think of one of Mandela’s favorite quotes, from the poem Invictus, which sustained him during those moments when he thought his journey had been cut short: I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.

	- Even if it’s not your ideal life, you can always choose it. No matter what your life is, choosing it changes everything. ([Location 7531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003062GEE&location=7531))
	- Four different surfaces. And yet a matching set. Complete. On the eve of my final tournament, I enjoy that sense we all seek, that knowledge we get only a few times in life, that the themes of our life are connected, the seeds of our ending were there in the beginning, and vice versa.

	- Life is a tennis match between polar opposites. Winning and losing, love and hate, open and closed. It helps to recognize that painful fact early. Then recognize the polar opposites within yourself, and if you can’t embrace them, or reconcile them, at least accept them and move on. The only thing you cannot do is ignore them.
