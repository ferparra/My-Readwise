	- Most people think reference checks are useless.
	  
	  Because they're doing it wrong.
	  
	  7 questions to ask a reference — and become a better manager: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandanat/status/1432717817208614916))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- "Where do you see this person in 3 years?"
	  
	  Most people say 5 years. But that's too long. 3 years gets the reference thinking about ideal shorter-term outcomes for the candidate.
	  
	  Focus on getting intel that will help you be an impactful manager. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandanat/status/1432717818936578061))
	- "When was the last time you didn't see eye-to-eye?"
	  
	  It's a softer way to ask how the candidate deals with conflict. 
	  
	  And you'll get a specific example, which will be more helpful than a broad, non-specific description of their conflict resolution skills. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandanat/status/1432717820526309377))
	- "What are some ways you've seen them be helpful to others?"
	  
	  It's a nice way to get tactical examples of how they build relationships. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandanat/status/1432717822413746183))
	- "Tell me about a time you coached them on something."
	  
	  The reference person will relive a memory. You'll get their honest reaction. You may learn how the candidate responds to feedback.
	  
	  This prompt is also framed more collaboratively than: "Where do they need improvement?" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandanat/status/1432717824183709701))
	- “How would you rate the candidate on a scale of 1-10? You can’t say 7!”
	  
	  This pushes them to answer with 6 (just above average) or 8 (very good). It reveals more than you’d think.
	  
	  And if they say 9, they might clue you in on a skill that you can coach your candidate on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandanat/status/1432717825848881164))
	- "What's a skill you've seen them grow?"
	  
	  You'll get a sense of how the candidate learns and how self-directed they are. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandanat/status/1432717827367227408))
	- "What advice do you have for me as a manager to help them be successful in this role?"
	  
	  It’s an opportunity for free people management advice. Take it.
	  
	  Plus, it’s a constructive yet subtle way to learn about potential weaknesses. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandanat/status/1432717829044854793))
	- When I've been someone's reference, I was asked:
	  
	  • Why did you hire them?
	  • What was it like to work with them?
	  
	  These are not bad questions. They're just bland and can be easily answered with a vague: "They're great!" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandanat/status/1432717830638739459))
	- The problem with typical feedback-seeking questions like: 
	  
	  • Where do they need improvement?
	  • What are their strengths & weaknesses?
	  • What challenges did you have managing them?
	  
	  Most likely, they'll be reluctant to sound negative. You may get a non-answer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandanat/status/1432717832500953088))
	- The goal of a reference check is to get genuinely helpful insights. 
	  
	  Not to simply validate your instincts about the candidate. And certainly not to trash talk. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandanat/status/1432717834279440402))
	- Keep these questions in your back pocket for the next time you hire. You'll get an enlightening 20-30 minute conversation.
	  
	  And you'll set yourself up to be a great manager to that person. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandanat/status/1432717835931901961))
