document_note:: This text discusses the logical fallacy of "affirming the consequent," which is when we assume that a certain premise must be true (in this case, that it is raining) based on an observed conclusion (the wet sidewalk). The Bayes theorem is used to calculate the probability of the premise being true given the observed conclusion, and the closer the probability is to 1, the more likely it is that the premise is true. In this case, if the sidewalk is observed to be wet, it is safe to assume that it is raining.
