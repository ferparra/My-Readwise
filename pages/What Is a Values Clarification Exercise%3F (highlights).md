document_note:: A values clarification exercise is a practice often found in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) which helps with decision-making and identity-finding. It involves becoming aware of one's values and making them explicit to others in order to clarify goals and purpose. It is especially helpful during times of life transition, confusion about decisions, or personal and professional burnout. It involves identifying one's goals and values, exploring why they are important, and marrying one's goals to their values. It is a great way to use one's truths to guide decisions and maintain authenticity.
