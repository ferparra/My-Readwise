	- I’ve talked a lot about cognitive task analysis, which is this fairly new (30 yo) technique to extract expertise from the heads of experts.
	  
	  You know how pros can’t tell you how or what they’re doing? e.g. “It just feels right”
	  
	  Yeah, CTA solves for that.

	- “What are some of the biggest challenges in CTA”
	  
	  “One major problem is figuring out who, exactly, has expertise (…) often we get recommended people who are well liked (but just not very good)” https://t.co/asGe3MvANo ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1567009371456151557))
	- Sometimes experts tend to leave out certain decisions that they make. Because it’s so intuitive to them.
	  
	  But this has problems when you’re training students.
	  
	  Clark tells the story of surgeons leaving out a major decision in training, resulting in bad outcomes for patients: https://t.co/Fv21NvMHwo ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1567011892182528005))
	- “We have found similar things in the energy industry, with people making decisions on where to drill wells”
	  
	  In this case, experts who have been doing this for awhile leave out specific decision steps when explicating their knowledge.
	  
	  So: training was bad! https://t.co/WyrH6r7XD8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1567012773560995841))
	- “It’s resulted in the discovery of a lot more successful wells, let’s put it that way.”
	  
	  “And this has happened in almost every case where we’ve done a cognitive task analysis.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1567013278207057921))
	- “We’ve actually done a series of cognitive task analysis on how large orgs train managers (…) and how good managers motivate.”
	  
	  “The findings from those are going to be published in the Harvard Business Review”
	  
	  That article: https://t.co/7pbEY9rcS1 https://t.co/rZ0xNJ3zMh ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1567017663444156418))
	- Why does this happen?
	  
	  Well, experts may see what they’re doing with their actions, but they’re not as good with what goes on in their heads.
	  
	  Clark says that chunking is the heart of expertise, but chunking also means intuition and expert decision making becomes invisible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1567020909302808576))
	- As a result, traditional task analysis misses out on 80% of the instruction necessary for effective training, which CTA solves for.
	  
	  Clark also notes that the 1 cost benefit study he’s seen: 7x up front time costs, but 1/2 training time and save 2.5 person years per trainee. https://t.co/zHhyvliCla ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1567021622934249472))
	- So what *is* CTA? And how do you go about researching or doing it?
	  
	  “There are over 100 CTA methods, but there are really only 4-6 with results, and only 3 with major results”
	  
	  I’m not really sure which meta analysis this is, but probably: https://t.co/ua3ipVmPUu https://t.co/8FeYpbJylz ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1567023220481736705))
