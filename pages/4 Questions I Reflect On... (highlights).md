	- 4 questions I reflect on every Sunday:
	  
	  • What were my biggest wins of the week?
	  • When did I feel most energized and excited?
	  • What weighed on me throughout the week?
	  • When did I feel most drained or unexcited?
	  
	  Helps me identify what to double down on and what to cut. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1482715725374627843))

	- Then at the end of the month, I aggregate these into a: 
	  
	  1. Monthly wins/highlights list 
	  2. Monthly drained/lowlights list
	  
	  And then I'll ask:
	  
	  1. How can I free up time to do more of #1
	  2. How can I set up systems to avoid doing #2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1482716603661828103))
	- The best part about this is at the end of the year I get to see 2 lists:
	  
	  1. A ledger of the best wins of the year to celebrate 
	  
	  2. A ledger of all the things that weighed on me / drained me throughout the year (which when looked at over a longer horizon, seem very trivial) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1482717018071744517))
	- If I started a newsletter that sent you a daily, high-signal reflection question across the areas of your health, wealth, relationships, and business - who would subscribe? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1482872341201924101))
