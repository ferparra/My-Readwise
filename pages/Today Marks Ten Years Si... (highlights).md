	- Today marks ten years since this infographic back page about the Kowloon Walled City was published by South China Morning Post. I explained in a few lectures the ins and outs of this project, and now I will do it here. Long üßµ

		- **Note**: Thread
	- I love to go and sketch outdoors. It is an essential practice for me to learn more and more from observation drawing. I went to a particular park with some @USk_HongKong  friends

	- So here I was, so happy drawing this bucolic pond‚Äîwatercolour and sepia ink marker on Moleskine notebook

	- Here you go; I finished the watercolour sketch

	- This day I learned about the history that contained this park. My urban sketcher friends explained to me the park's origin, once the walled enclave of Kowloon

	- The story impressed me, and I had never heard of it. I was fascinated by everything they told me. The park also has educational sections to understand more about Kowloon Walled City. There is a lot of material to get ideas

	- When I got to the office a few days later, I told my bosses I wanted to do something about this topic. At first, the project went on hold. We decided to go ahead after realising that the anniversary of its demolition was coming up ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adolfux/status/1636026822034096128))
	- I started with research. It wasn‚Äôt too much information ten years ago. Kowloon Walled City was an enclave belonging to China; it left without a garrison after World War II. The place grew exponentially with refugees from China ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adolfux/status/1636026824408055811))
	- I found the magnificent book by Greg Girard and Ian Lambot, ‚ÄúCity of Darkness‚Äù; it was the primary basis for collecting visual information

	- I lived in this area, and finding inspiration in Hong Kong was easy

	- The series of 13 Rue del Percebe by Francisco Ib√°√±ez from my childhood influenced me too

	- Some sketches and compilation of preliminary ideas on a Moleskine sketchbook after research

	- Final rough sketch and layout

	- For the main illustration, I prepared an isometric grid where I would draw the cutaway. An isometric view would be the best way to detail the life inside Kowloon Walled City

	- With @CorelPainter, I started to draw the line with the pencil tool using the grid that served as a guide to project the isometric view

	- I am adding details to the illustration. The days go by fast when drawing with that

	- An advanced process in Adobe Illustrator

	- I start to add the colour; I always work with a layer of neutral colour, so adding colours is easier for me to combine

	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FrRUYusaMAAuaeG.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adolfux/status/1636026857182363649))
	- I don't usually use many layers; in this case, only two, one for the line and another for the colour 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FrRUijCaIAEUHVy.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adolfux/status/1636026860684595200))
	- The result combined both layers

	- The bottom part shows the evolution of this enclave. When it was a walled city in the 19th century, it was part of the Qing Dynasty's China

	- During the Japanese occupation, the wall's stones were used to build the Kai Tak airfield. After World War II, the Hong Kong government abandoned the enclave without jurisdiction; it began to fill with refugees arriving from China. That's how the city was in 1950

	- The ungoverned city grew exponentially. This is how the city was in 1973

	- In 1990, shortly before its demolition, the city looked like this

	- After the demolition, it became a park, the Walled City Park I mentioned at the beginning of this story. That I how it looks now.

	- Combined with this, other evolution with a visualisation based on points; each point is a person living in the City of anarchy. The years highlighted are 1898, with 700 inhabitants; 1940, 1950, 1973, 1980 and 1993, with 50,000. @officeofjane helped to produce these points https://t.co/jy9KHeGlCk ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adolfux/status/1636027218525827072))

	- Some latest reviews by Steve Case, art director at @SCMPNews at that time. These reviews were done at the Navarra University cafeter√≠a when we assisted the @malofiej summit. Luckily this graphic won the gold medal at the Malofiej the following year

	- Thanks for reading. I'm not familiar with doing long threads, and maybe I messed up it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adolfux/status/1636028714420142081))
