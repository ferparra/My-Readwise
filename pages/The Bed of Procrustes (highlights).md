document_note:: The document "The Bed of Procrustes" is a collection of aphorisms about the idea of "Procrustean bed" which is a metaphor for humans adapting to the world by fitting it into prepackaged ideas and reductive categories. This leads to consequences, such as changing the brains of schoolchildren to fit the curriculum instead of the other way around. The writer encourages readers to be selective about their profession and to appreciate the freedom of not having to explain why you do something. Other topics discussed include the importance of understanding the differences between stories and situations, the implications of socializing with the poor or the rich, and the power of knowledge in being able to ignore irrelevant information.
