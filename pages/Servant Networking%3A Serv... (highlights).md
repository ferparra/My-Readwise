	- 2/ Traditional networking goes something like: connect first, serve later. Expectation of delayed value at some future point in time.

	- 4/ A couple of principles: 
	  
	  1) By giving - you've already gained for yourself
	  2) Expect nothing in return
	  3) Most people will recognize genuine generosity and you WILL receive in return even w/o expectation
	  4) Table stakes, you must be proactive and creative
	- 5/ Steps – every new potential connection will comprise of some form of these steps:
	  
	  1) Intent – mindset of "how can I serve?"
	  2) Contribution – creating, writing, designing, whatever it is
	  3) Delivery – getting it to the person/community you're serving
	  4) Outcome – expect none

	- 11/ Servant networking teaches you creativity, generosity, patience, gratitude – whats not to love? Even if you end up meeting zero people, you win for yourself.
