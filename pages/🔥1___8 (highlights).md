document_note:: This document introduces "Task-driven Autonomous Agent", an AI-powered system that can autonomously create and perform tasks based on an objective. It leverages GPT-4, Pinecone vector search, and LangChainAI framework to complete tasks, generate new tasks based on results, and prioritize tasks in real-time. The system has sparked conversations about AI safety measures and has been shared publicly to raise awareness of potential risks.
