	- AI agents can now teach themselves HOW to use tools (ie. any API) in real time, completely automated!

	- When given a task, SLAPA knows to search for the API documentation and learn all the information. Then he create API calls. If they don't work, he learns from his mistake and tries again.

	- SLAPA's knowledge accumulates. He only needs to read documentation if you ask for a new API he's never encountered before; otherwise, he already knows it. As more people use SLAPA, the more comprehensive his knowledge becomes. He also gets better at writing API calls. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DYtweetshere/status/1631349182601760769))
	- Recent work, such as Toolformer, have demonstrated that language models can teach themselves WHEN to use tools. 
	  
	  With SLAPA, we show that language models can also teach themselves HOW to use tools! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DYtweetshere/status/1631349183809716225))
