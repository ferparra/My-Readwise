	- Let's address the 800lb gorilla first...
	  
	  Everything that I'm going to talk about here takes work to:
	  
	  • Build
	  • Refine
	  • Maintain
	  
	  Nothing is purely "set it and forget it"
	  
	  But this is about building leveraged systems that split time from income.
	  
	  Let's begin... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1657022434904616965))
	- 1. Determine your "Intersection of Income"
	  
	  It's not enough to "write what you love"
	  
	  You must write at the intersection of:
	  
	  • Your expertise
	  • What's popular
	  • What's profitable
	  
	  Use tools like quora and answerthepublic to find what's popular. https://t.co/hGnySBdht4 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1657022473701933064))
	- 2. Study the patterns of others
	  
	  Create a list of 5-10 accounts you aspire to.
	  
	  Study their:
	  
	  • Publishing cadence
	  • Content structures
	  • Topic buckets
	  • Networks
	  
	  Anything and everything they're doing (that's working for them). https://t.co/T6zDsLdse8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1657022526780764160))
	- 3. Build an effective bio
	  
	  Your bio should tell your potential audience:
	  
	  • WHAT you write
	  • WHO you write for
	  • WHY the should care
	  
	  And use your featured section to showcase:
	  
	  • Credible expertise
	  • Social proof
	  • Your offer
	  
	  Nail the first impression. https://t.co/xPnLiQORFl ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1657022591289237509))
	- 4. Generate traffic
	  
	  Digital income streams rely on traffic. Full stop.
	  
	  Use:
	  
	  • Posts
	  • Articles
	  • Threads
	  • Carousels
	  
	  Anything you can to (shamelessly) promote your expertise. https://t.co/r8hft4k64h ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1657022629075722241))
	- 5. Redirect the traffic
	  
	  The money is in the list.
	  
	  Use:
	  
	  • CTAs
	  • Opt-ins
	  • Auto-plugs
	  
	  To create an ecosystem that gets your audience off the platform.
	  
	  And onto your list. https://t.co/g3u0P0oH27 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1657022676291006468))
	- 6. Fish for problems
	  
	  Your audience will tell you their:
	  
	  • Pains
	  • Struggles
	  • Obstacles
	  
	  But only if you ask them.
	  
	  Use a welcome email that prompts your new subscriber to share why they joined and what they're working on. https://t.co/RrV0MuSnlt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1657022708993912836))
	- 7. Construct your offer and landing page
	  
	  Create the offer first.
	  
	  To nail a bulletproof offer write out:
	  
	  • The problems
	  • Your solutions
	  • Why it's urgent
	  • Why it's different
	  
	  This will help you build the product. https://t.co/DhqZWz6XXH ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1657022750723043329))
	- 8. Create a content queue
	  
	  We don't want to work on this every day.
	  
	  Here's your blueprint:
	  
	  • Map out a few hours a week
	  • Use tools like Hypefury to build a queue
	  • Create as much content in advance as possible
	  
	  Focus less on content and more on your business. https://t.co/oxrcSquJ0s ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1657022791894327297))
	- 9. Automate everything
	  
	  Now, every time you:
	  
	  • Publish a piece of content
	  • You include a relevant opt-in
	  • That prompts an offer via email
	  
	  This puts your offer right in front of the right person.
	  
	  Every time. https://t.co/TiuEmm5V9D ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio/status/1657022836945420290))
