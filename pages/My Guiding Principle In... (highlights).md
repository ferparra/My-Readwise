	- My guiding principle in hosting Spaces: Cultivating the right panel leads to extraordinary discussions.
	  
	  Twitter allows 10 speaker slots (11 including host). When they fill up, I aim for 8-9 proven panelists, rotating in 1-2 unknowns at a time.

	- Proven panelists are chosen by a mix of these factors: excellent discussion leaders (in current or past Spaces), specialized knowledge, large number of followers, actively participating in the current discussion.

	- Unknowns are rotated in to raise new topics. If you have a hard time interrupting, I can help. But if the panel is going strong on a topic, I'll be inclined to just let them continue. In a larger Space it may be a long wait to come on stage.

	- I actively remove panelists in order to optimize discussion, if you've been quiet for awhile. It's just business, not personal haha. When you're ready to speak again just submit a request and I'll bring you back on stage.

	- I tend not to be a discussion leader, rather focusing on panel optimization, intervening when a topic or speaker becomes unproductive, etc. I occasionally add my 2 sats.
	  
	  These are my thoughts after hosting a dozen or so Spaces. Input is welcome as I'm open to change.

	- P.S. As to topics, anything related to bitcoin is welcome: macroecon, geopolitics, tech of bitcoin, institutions, news, price action, community, etc., etc.... but not drama related to personalities in the bitcoin space.
	  
	  As to altcoins...

	- ...altcoiners are welcome to come onstage to discuss BTC.
	  
	  If altcoins are discussed, it will be (non-toxically) from the standpoint of why only BTC is a truly decentralized and secure network, and what altcoin use cases might have a future if migrated to the BTC network.
