	- A good analogy here is poker. Pre-launch, you have a hand (the team, the idea, the market, etc). When you launch, it's like seeing the flop. That can make or break your hand.
	  
	  9-9 looks good pre-launch. But it looks amazing if the flop is 9-5-2 and terrible if the flop is Q-K-A. https://t.co/vSQMqZrXTv ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lpolovets/status/1485398667838345217))

	- Pre-flop, there's a wide distribution of final outcomes, and you can estimate the strength of your hand. Post-flop, the distribution of outcomes narrows greatly, and the value of your hand can be much lower or higher. 
	  
	  Now replace 'hand' with 'startup', & 'flop' with 'launch'. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lpolovets/status/1485400206988529664))
	- Maybe I should write a blog post about this. Wish I had more time to write! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lpolovets/status/1485400515248803843))
