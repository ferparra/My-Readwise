document_note:: This article discusses a study that used fMRI and EEG to record the brain activity of 20 healthy volunteers before, during, and after taking a dose of DMT, the psychedelic compound found in ayahuasca. The scientists found increased connectivity in the brain, particularly in areas involved in highly evolved functions like imagination and decision-making. They also believe that this increased connectivity may explain the profound psychedelic experience and promising results from early clinical trials using DMT in combination with psychotherapy to treat depression.
