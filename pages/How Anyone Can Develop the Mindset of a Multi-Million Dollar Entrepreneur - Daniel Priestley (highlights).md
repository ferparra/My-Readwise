	  So all of these skills relate to a broader set of skills, which is entrepreneurship. And some of the skills is understanding why people buy. So for example, all people buy things to relieve a psychological tension between what they have and what they want. So that is the underlying reason why anyone buys anything. There is some form of a psychological tension. Something's not right in the world. It should be this way, but it's currently this way. And I want to close that gap. So that's the buying process. Now, sometimes people don't have much psychological tension around something, but it could be widened. Some people have a dormant psychological tension, which they're not consciously aware of, or they're not solution seeking, they're just dealing, they're just holding onto the problem and holding onto the frustration, but they're not in the process. And you can spark a decision-making process. So the more you understand why people buy and what's going on under the surface, and the fact that there are people actively looking for things, and then there are people who are passively dealing with a frustration or problem, but not actively searching. So getting a working understanding of these things is really powerful. The other thing that triggers every single sale is a combination of emotion, logic, and urgency. So some, and I've found that all businesses are only really naturally good at one. So some businesses naturally are good at generating emotion in their customers, but not logic or urgency. Some businesses are really good with the logical side of why you should buy, but they're not very good at the emotion or the urgency. And some businesses are the hard sales business.
