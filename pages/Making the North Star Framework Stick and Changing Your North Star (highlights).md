	- **Activated Organizations:** Activated Organizations (AOs) are organizations that have reached at least five WLUs. We have found that once we reach this threshold, there is a high likelihood that this customer will continue to grow with us.

	- **Broadcasted Learnings:** A chart, dashboard, or [Notebook](https://amplitude.com/blog/feature-release-notebooks) is considered to be a "Broadcasted Learning" (BLs) when it is consumed by two or more people within a seven-day period. By measuring the total number of high-quality learnings, we are able to get great insight into the health of our accounts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbx2ad93vsh53epqaw4rxbh))
	- **Consumption of Learnings:** Consumption of Learnings (CoLs) measures the total reach of all BL. This is our best proxy of how deeply an insight is shared across the organization. CoL measures the total reach of BL in an organization within a seven-day period. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbx2d4464eh1mcc4xa034g0))
	- In our experience working with product teams, many organizations trying to implement the North Star Framework succumb to what product development expert Jabe Bloom describes as *gap thinking*, which causes them to lose momentum and revert to old patterns.

	- The **major problem with gap thinking, as it relates to any change effort, is that teams become vested in a fixed endpoint that never materializes.** They inadvertently devalue the present. There’s a lot of long-term planning and execution and long feedback cycles. When they don’t achieve the future—when they don’t close the gap—they lose steam and give up. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbx3s50y6mhjf1jrv2ne7k2))
	- To make the shift to present thinking, consider Jabe Bloom’s present *thinking* questions:
	  
	  •   "Where are we?"
	  •   "What do I need now?"
	  •   "How do I improve the current way of working?" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbx46y62z3sj5ce9hnz3be1))
