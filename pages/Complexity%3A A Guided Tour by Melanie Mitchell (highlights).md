document_note:: This text is from a book about chaos and complexity titled "Complexity: A Guided Tour" by Melanie Mitchell. It explains how complex behavior can arise from relatively simple rules among many individuals, and provides examples such as ant colonies and brain networks. It explores the concepts of emergence, self-organization, attractors, entropy, dynamical systems, nonlinear systems, statistical mechanics, and information processing. It also explains the ideas of chaos theory, evolutionary economics, network theory, and self-reference in DNA. Finally, it looks at the concept of meaning, the Turing machine, the Von Neumann self-reproducing automaton, genetic algorithms, the Prisoner's Dilemma, and network thinking.

	- **Dynamical systems** – description and prediction of systems that exhibit complex, changing behavior emerging from interaction of many components ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1whhmdjp93c1j3m53sww6))
	- **Nonlinear syste**m – whole is different from the sum of the parts
	  
	  1.  Attractors – fixed point, periodic, chaotic (logistic map) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1wmr324xf45jcw7wg6yrt))
	- **Entropy** – energy which can’t be converted to work and turns to heat
	  
	  1.  The second law of dynamics is said to define the “arrow of time” in that it proves there are processes that cannot be revised in time (heat spontaneously returning after work is done). The “future” is defined as the direction of time in which entropy increases. Why the second law of thermodynamics is different from all other physical laws in that it should distinguish between the past and future while all other laws of nature do not is perhaps the greatest mystery in physics ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1wq5bevqb70nprr5b09wp))
		- **Note**: The second law of thermodynamics defines the "arrow of time" by proving that certain processes cannot be reversed. Entropy, or energy which cannot be converted to work and turns to heat, increases in the direction of the "future". This law is distinct from all other physical laws in that it is the only one to distinguish between the past and future, leading to the greatest mystery in physics.
	- **Statistical mechanics** – proposes that large-scale properties (heat) emerge from microscopic properties (motion of trillions of molecules) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1xp0yhyv7bgszqjezbvjr))
	- **Self-reference in DNA** – complex cellular machinery – mRNA, tRNA, ribosomes, polymerases and so forth – that effect the transcription, translation, and replication of DNA are themselves encoded int that very DNA
	  
	  1.  **It is both information and input!** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1xtyqb22bb4vc2as9yy5p))
	- **Shannon entropy** – one simple measure of complexity is size so Shanon entropy is the average information content or “amount of surprise” a message source has for a receiver
	  
	  1.  The most complex entities don’t have the most order or randomness but fall somewhere in between ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1xx3dnmhs45352ay7fwq3))
	- **Meaning** – the meaning of an event is what tells one how to respond to it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1y3txz82zyz8rb3cm19j3))
	- **Idea Models** – relatively simple models meant to gain insights into a general concept without the necessity of making detailed predictions about any specific system
	  
	  1.  Maxwell’s demon – exploring the concept of entropy
	  2.  Turing machine – defining “definite procedure” and exploring computation
	  3.  Logistic model and logistic map – minimal models for predicting population growth, dynamics and chaos in general
	  4.  Von Neumann’s self-reproducing automaton – exploring the “logic” of self-reproduction
	  5.  Genetic algorithm – exploring the concept of adaptation. Sometimes used as a minimal model of Darwinian evolution
	  6.  Cellular automaton – complex systems in general
	  7.  Koch curve – exploring fractal-like structures such as coastlines and snowflakes
	  8.  Copycat – human analogy making ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1y963m7866kra9y3wwpb0))
		- **Note**: Idea models are relatively simple models used to gain insight into a general concept without making detailed predictions about any specific system. Examples of idea models include Maxwell's demon (entropy), Turing machine (definite procedure), logistic model and logistic map (population growth and dynamics/chaos), Von Neumann's self-reproducing automaton (self-reproduction), genetic algorithm (adaptation/Darwinian evolution), cellular automaton (complex systems), Koch curve (fractal-like structures), and Copycat (analogy making).
	- **Prisoner’s dilemma** – pursuit of self-interest for each leads to poor outcome for all
	  
	  1.  **Tit for Tat is the best strategy with the first being cooperation**
	  2.  Predictability is important for cooperation
	  3.  Close proximity aids cooperation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1ydn4tkx2b31e52k4508r))
	- People have poor intuitive understanding of coincidence ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1ygnhjxgvj1hk2b7bdt8w))
	- Network thinking will permeate through all human activity and inquiry ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1ym12pmc2bs7zksvg6anm))
	- A major discovery to date of network science is that high-clustering, skewed degree distributions and hub structure seem to be characteristic of the vast majority of all the natural, social and technological networks that network scientists have studied
	  
	  1.  Hubs – high-degree nodes and are major conduits for the flow of activity or information in networks (Google)
	  2.  Small-world property – a network with relatively few long distance connections but has a small average path-length relative to the total number of nodes
	    1.  A network with 1,000 nodes, slightly rewired with random links brings down the average path length from 250 to 20…
	    2.  Evolved because information needs to travel quickly within the system and creating and maintaining reliable long-distance connections is very energy expensive. Nature has selected for it – robust, resilient, effective, efficient, energy-cheap…
	    3.  Web is scale-free, small world network (fractal) – relatively small number of very high-degree hubs (Google), nodes with degrees over a very large range of different values (heterogeneity of degree value), self-similarity
	    4.  Scale-free network = power-law degree distribution ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1yv2pt8pn9hy61q9h9z5t))
		- **Note**: Network science has discovered that most natural, social, and technological networks share three common characteristics: hubs, the small-world property, and a scale-free network with a power-law degree distribution. Hubs are high-degree nodes that act as major conduits for the flow of activity or information, and the small-world property is a network with relatively few long-distance connections that has a small average path-length. The scale-free network is characterized by a heterogeneity of degree values and self-similarity, and it has a power-law degree distribution. This structure has evolved because it is robust, resilient, effective, efficient, and energy-cheap.
	- **Scaling** – how one property of a system will change if a related property changes. The scaling mystery in biology concerns the question of how the average energy used by an organism while resting – the basal metabolic rate – scales with the organism’s body mass
	  
	  1.  Metabolic rate proportional to body mass ^3/4
	    1.  Larger animals are more efficient than smaller ones and this leads to heart having to work less hard and the larger animal, on average, to live longer
	  2.  Circulatory system is fractal
	  3.  Metabolism is universal to all life so this touches every aspect of biology ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1zfzs7sp0tbb67thpsszc))
		- **Note**: The scaling mystery in biology concerns how the average energy used by an organism while resting, the basal metabolic rate, is related to the organism's body mass. It has been observed that larger animals are more efficient than smaller ones, leading to the heart having to work less hard and the larger animal, on average, living longer. This is due to the circulatory system being fractal and the metabolism being universal to all life, affecting every aspect of biology.
