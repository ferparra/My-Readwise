document_note:: Travis Stevens is a 2016 Olympic Judo silver medalist and black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. In this episode of the Lex Fridman Podcast, he discusses his Olympic career, how Judo has shaped him into a resilient and proud man, and his strategies for weight cutting and nutrition. He also explains the two principles of Judo, Osoto-gari and Ippon Seoinage, and his horrifying injury history. Travis emphasizes that success is subjective and rarely lives in a narrative, and that the process is often more valuable than the result. He also shares his thoughts on making weight and the importance of maintaining a low center of gravity in Judo.
