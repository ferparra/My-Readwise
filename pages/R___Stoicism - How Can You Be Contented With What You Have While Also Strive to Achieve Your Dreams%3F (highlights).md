	- Imagine you’re an archer of the highest proficiency. Your form is impeccable. You’ve loaded your arrow and are ready for the draw. At this point in time you are entirely in control.You’ve now released the arrow, and have given up control. An unsuspected wind throws off it’s trajectory and you’ve missed your target. However, instead of attaching to the outcome and reacting negatively, you keep your cool and try again.TL;DR:You’ve done all that is within your control and to the best of your ability (action), but don’t let the outcome (fruit), which is not in your control, negatively affect your performance as an archer going forward.
	- Living an "ambitious" life is not in contradiction to the stoic idea of giving up desire for things not in our control. The way I look at it is to desire to be a person that can achieve said goal, not desire the goal itself.
