	- A recently IPO'd company mandated moving over to JIRA because... well, reporting, and lack of options. So they did.
	  
	  As a data-driven company, they ran a survey afterward. The NPS for JIRA among engineers: -83. This means that 83% of devs would recommend *against* JIRA (!!). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1440242068102680595))

	- Now I'm not saying JIRA is terrible... but it requires a long, and painful learning curve that most people don't tolerate. And, let's be honest: they hate.
	  
	  It's also why companies like @linear are capturing the market with startups and places where engineers are decision makers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1440242573516292102))
	- JIRA also increasingly has a perception problem after years of treating decision-makers as their end users, not the engineers forced to use a tool to move things around.
	  
	  Those engineers are now becoming decision-makers. And they want to desperately avoid JIRA, given the options. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1440243164992868354))
	- As another fun fact, people at about 100 different companies shared details on how projects are run at https://t.co/5BBiiDDOHx
	  
	  JIRA was mentioned 13 times. *Only* in a negative context.
	  
	  (Not saying there are teams who don't like it: but no one raved about it) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1440243746730242055))
	- Back to the company. They are engineering-led, (internally) transparent & a tech company. 
	  
	  Results are *so* uncomparably bad, and could indicate eng attrition, that on top of the usual (training, talk w vendor etc) they're also exploring moving off JIRA, at least for engineers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1440245519566065673))
	- This will be a challenge for JIRA.
	  
	  They've captured the [[project management]] market, but piss off engineering users. And it's becoming risky to do so, especially for modern companies that look at data like this.
	  
	  And JIRA can't afford to get locked out of tech/eng organizations. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1440246120563703808))
	- The article is out on [[project management]] approaches after going through data from close to 100 companies. Here's the article, and the section on JIRA: https://t.co/LdEYMQ3Eb1
	  
	  Obviously, this is non-representative, but still, not flattering.
