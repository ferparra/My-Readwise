	- I journal every single morning for at least 30 minutes.
	  
	  I've been doing this since 2010.
	  
	  But over the years, I've learned you can (very easily) overcomplicate the act of journaling.
	  
	  Which is why now I only use 4 prompts:

	- Question #1: "What did I do yesterday?"
	  
	  The very first thing I do is reflect on the past 24 hours:
	  
	  â€¢ What did I do yesterday?
	  â€¢ How did it feel?
	  â€¢ What did I learn?
	  
	  I like this prompt because only the most important things come to mind.
	  
	  Pay attention. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1487563301139615745))
	- Question #2: "What am I working on?"
	  
	  A big part of journaling for me is repeating things I want to internalize:
	  
	  â€¢ Repeating goals
	  â€¢ Repeating mindset patterns
	  â€¢ Repeating feelings & lessons
	  
	  The more I repeat it in my journal, the more I think about it during the day. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1487563302058160140))
	- Question #3: "What's coming up?"
	  
	  Next, I look toward the future.
	  
	  What's around the bend?
	  
	  What can I start proactively processing through now?
	  
	  This helps prepare the mind in advance for feelings, challenges, or obstaclesâ€”and helps you not feel so "caught off guard." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1487563302959927296))
	- Question #4: "What am I grateful for?"
	  
	  I end every journaling session with a Thank You.
	  
	  I thank the path in front of me.
	  
	  I remind myself I am grateful for every opportunity to learn, whether it's difficult or not.
	  
	  And I welcome the day to come with open arms. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1487563303836520448))
	- I started journaling deliberately like this when I was 19 years old.
	  
	  I'd just gotten back from a rehab trip, and felt extremely lost & confused.
	  
	  I didn't know what I wanted out of life, or whether I would amount to much.
	  
	  So I wrote to myself about it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1487563304818003968))
	- This has become my favorite part about journaling over long periods of time:
	  
	  You can literally see the progress in front of you.
	  
	  Things I journaled about when I was 19, I don't journal about anymore. I've grown out of them.
	  
	  Keeping a journal documents your growth as a human. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1487563305707180032))
	- I will keep this habit until the day I die.
	  
	  I attribute a significant portion of my success over the past 5 years to my daily journaling practice.
	  
	  There is no better way to hear yourself, become conscious of your thoughts, and take actionable steps forward. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1487563306638274560))
