		- **Note**: Thread
	- I have been obsessed with heuristics and tests ever since I read NN Taleb's "Fooled By Randomness" in 2011, and later Gary Klein's "Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions"
	  
	  I use these tests and try to teach them to the people I work with
	  
	  Here they are: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1593867110970802176))
	- 1. Picasso’s Bull Principle
	  
	  It calls back to many disciplines
	  In design, we must understand the problem before we design a solution
	  In Jobs-to-be-done, we must understand the tradeoffs people make
	  
	  The principle: you can't draw the full picture until you understand the essence https://t.co/uYxqoKF9Yi ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1593867113114091520))
	- 2. The Happiness Test
	  
	  From Annie Duke's "How To Decide"
	  
	  The PMs role is about making decisions, and often we get stuck in paralysis
	  
	  Many smart people struggle with this. They reach for intense spreadsheets to try to answer the question.
	  
	  This heuristic acts like a razor:

	- 3. The Naive Untangle Test
	  
	  It asks: If you put your best solution vs. a problem, does the story of how it will solve the problem sound naive?
	  
	  E.g. You're creating a text document (X) to improve cross-functional collaboration (Y). Tell the story of solving Y with X. Naive? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1593867132084883457))
	- 4. The CEO Test
	  
	  Learned this from @shreyas 
	  
	  Imagine presenting an ugly compromise to the CEO.
	  
	  What do we think of that argument? Do we believe we can hold our ground on this?
	  
	  We should try to think bigger, question our limits, and gain more conviction preemptively. https://t.co/kZcDQ4z9it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1593867138523095040))
	- 5. The Mom Test
	  
	  Don't believe opinions, hypothetical & general answers.
	  
	  Avoid even asking general/hypothetical questions.
	  
	  Smart people do this all the time. 
	  
	  Dig into the specifics. 
	  
	  When did you do X? vs. Do you usually do X?
	  Where did you go? vs. Where do you usually go? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1593867145150361600))
	- 6. The Only-Option Test
	  
	  Another razor from Annie Duke.
	  
	  BONUS: If you can't decide between 2 options, that means either of them are good.
