	- EVM rollups (both zk and optimistic!) will experience the same issues if they offer anything more than Ethereum's ~15 tps. The only solution is the hard one: scalability requires fundamental improvements to the execution and data model, not just putting the EVM in a rollup. https://t.co/AChU0RYHY2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jadler0/status/1410771222984544257))
	- Just published "Accounts, Strict Access Lists, and UTXOs."
	  
	  TL;DR: UTXOs can do anything accounts can, but possibly better (more opportunities to exploit parallelism). I describe how to design Ethereum-style smart contracts in the UTXO data model.
