document_note:: Steven Sinofsky, former president of the Windows & Office divisions at Microsoft, discusses the lessons he learned while leading Office & Windows, the art of writing well, and effective leadership. He emphasizes stewing with ideas for days and using the five-paragraph essay format. He also reflects on his memo to Bill Gates, which explained why Microsoft had to adopt the “internet thing,” and how Microsoft’s culture of being email-heavy and aggressive was rooted in the personalities of Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. He also shares his thoughts on open source software, dominance, and the Mac vs PC ads which drove him “bonkers.” Lastly, he talks about the state of desktop and laptop computing, and whether we are at the end of the smartphone innovation cycle.
