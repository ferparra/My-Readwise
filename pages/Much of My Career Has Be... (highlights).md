	- Much of my career has been working either as a consultant, in a consulting company, or in consulting roles within non-consulting companies.
	  
	  One of the things I learned over 15+ years: there are only four reasons a consultant is hired.
	  
	  Thread ðŸ‘‰
	- Reason #1: To help the organization do something it perceives as risky without specialist talent
	  
	  Many clients lack in-house expertise in specialty areas. Consultants help.
	  
	  Sometimes they have expertise, but need a consultant for legit reasons (auditors) or dysfunctional ones.

	- Reason #2: To augment its existing staff and talent
	  
	  All you long-term contract engineers, this is you. Butt-in-seat staff augmentation. They just need more people, have trouble staffing FTEs, and you fit the bill.
	- Reason #3: To deliver a message from one part of the organization to another
	  
	  Surprising absolutely no one, large enterprises aren't exactly known for their ability to communicate effectively or efficiently. A surprising amount of effort goes into getting people on the same page.
	- Reason #4: To provide cover for a decision
	  
	  As the old saying goes, "No one got fired for buying IBM."
	  
	  Sometimes the consultant is there to provide a convenient and willing sacrifice for a potentially risky or unpopular decision.
	  
	  It's not fun, but it happens.
