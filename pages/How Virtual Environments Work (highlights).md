	- Virtual environments are different than *conda environments* (in my opinion; some people disagree with me on this view). The key difference is that conda environments allow projects to install arbitrary shell scripts which are run when you activate a conda environment (which is done implicitly when you use `conda run`). This is why you are always expected to activate a conda environment, as some conda packages require those those shell scripts run. I won't be covering conda environments in this post.
