- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 18th, 2022]]
	- After listening to 100 Nathan Latka Podcasts, observing 200 Indiehacker podcasts and watching 50 Microconf talks AND recording 80 episodes myself
	  
	  Here's what I've observed
	  ðŸ§µ
	- SEO
	  
	  Over 70% of founders credited SEO for being their best source of growth. Invest into ASAP and build up that MOAT
	- FB / Social Media
	  
	  Its a hit or miss. Don't waste time curating the perfect Ad or post. Tim Doyle of Eucalyptus shared that his most profitable Ad was not some high quality video but rather a Doge meme
	- Velocity is everything
	  
	  When building companies you NEED to move fast, there is no alternative to it
	- Product
	  
	  Product led growth is the BEST type, its natural and doesn't feel forced
	- SLC
	  
	  NO ONE wants to use an MVP - stop using that mindset. Literally no one other than your Mum will use a "minimum viable" thing. Its 2020, the whole patchy product cycle doesn't exist.
	  
	  Aim for Simple, Loveable and Complete 
	  
	  Introduce simple features that meet your north star
	- Cold Email
	  
	  Learn to master this, its a great skillset to have in building a company and distributing content
	- Feature Validation
	  
	  Before you build a feature, literally build a simple landing page, run some GAds to it for lifetime deals (this doesn't work always, but for some apps)
	- Communicate
	  
	  Build every channel possible to communicate with your user as often as possible for as long as possible
	- No CC No Bueno
	  
	  UNTIL someone gives you their Credit Card, you don't have validation. Do not take anything else as validation other than their Credit Card
	- Timeframe
	  
	  Before you start, set a goal to hit, if you don't hit that goal, be quick to reflect. Build more or move on
	  
	  Last but the MOST important
	- Audience
	  
	  Almost 90% of all the "Super successful" founders attributed having a previous built audience as their reason for success. They built this audience through, podcasts, blogs, Youtube, Tiktok or even Newsletters. Easiest way I've seen is through mini-pdf courses.
	- BUILD. AN. AUDIENCE
	  
	  You have a higher chance of succeeding with a shit product and a large audience than vice versa
