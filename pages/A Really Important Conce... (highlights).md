	- A really important concept to understand in work & life: the Antithesis Principle.
	  
	  It is best explained through some examples, so thatâ€™s where I will start this thread.

	- First example.
	  
	  Observation:
	  
	  Most people learn better when the content / teaching is entertaining. 
	  
	  Many people *only* learn if the content is entertaining. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1622844467370946562))
	- As a smart & ambitious person, if you think *deeply* about what you should take away from this observation, you have to conclude the 2 things:
	  
	  1) If you want to help people learn something, look into making it engaging / entertaining
	  
	  This is the easier, more obvious conclusion. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1622844468549529600))
	- 2) It is actually not in *your* best interest to be the kind of person who can *only* learn from entertaining content. Nor to be the kind of person that needs any sort of entertainment as a prerequisite for learning.
	  
	  90% of smart people will never consider this conclusion. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1622844469690368002))
