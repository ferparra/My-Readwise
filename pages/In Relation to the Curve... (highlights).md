	- This thread covers:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Curve and its importance to stablecoins.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ The partnership between $UST and $FRAX, and the formation of the Curve 4pool.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ The effects on the stablecoin economy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244230123433994))
	- If you don‚Äôt already know, @CurveFinance is a the largest DEX in DeFi accounting for more than $20bn in TVL. 
	  
	  Due to having such substantial liquidity it has become an essential DEX for stablecoins if they're aiming to become a prominent player within the DeFi stablecoin space. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244233260806151))
	- So, how can a protocol attain this liquidity?
	  
	  1. They can provide it themselves.
	  
	  2. They can buy and stake CRV/CVX to increase CRV incentives to their stablecoin pool.
	  
	  3. They can ‚Äúbribe‚Äù other CRV/CVX stakers to increase CRV incentives to their stablecoin pool. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244236943368197))
	- But these mechanics are expensive and have resulted in the Curve wars, where different stablecoin protocols such as @terra_money and @fraxfinance compete with one another for liquidity incentives. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244240009351170))
	- Currently, Curves largest stablecoin pool Is the 3pool (consisting of $USDT, $USDC and $DAI), despite the fact that none of them pay for liquidity incentives.
	  
	  So why do people provide liquidity to this pool if it‚Äôs not incentivised? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244243973021702))
	- Simple, it‚Äôs the central liquidity pool. All stablecoins achieve liquidity through pairing with this pool. For example:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ $UST is paired with the 3pool
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ $FRAX is paired with the 3pool ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244246963503111))
	- So when Terra uses their CRV/CVX voting power and ‚Äúbribes‚Äù to incentivise $UST liquidity on Curve, they are also directly incentivising $USDT, $USDC and $DAI liquidity. 
	  
	  The same goes for $FRAX, $MIM, and all other stablecoins. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244249945661441))
	- So, what‚Äôs about to change?
	  
	  @terra_money and @fraxfinance have announced a partnership which will introduce the curve 4pool which consists of $UST, $FRAX, $USDC and $USDT. Both protocols will direct all their CRV/CVX voting power (3.8M $CVX) and ‚Äúbribes‚Äù toward this new 4pool. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244253066219524))
	- This has significant effects on the overall stablecoin economy.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Increased liquidity and peg stability for $UST and $FRAX.
	  
	  With the 4pool, there will be a significant increase in $UST and $FRAX liquidity due to incentives being used together rather than against eachother. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244256568463369))
	- As other protocols pair their stablecoin pools to the 4pool rather than the 3pool, we will find that the demand for $UST and $FRAX will follow that for the greater stablecoin economy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244259705892864))
	- For example, if there is an increase in demand for $MIM liquidity, and it‚Äôs pooled with the 4pool, there will have to be a corresponding increase in demand for $UST and $FRAX, which will then be added to the 4pool liquidity pool. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244262985752576))
	- Through having these high amounts of liquidity, both $UST and $FRAX will have built a defensive cushion that can act as a counter-party to sellers during contractions in demand. This results in increased peg stability and decreased risk. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244266081239046))
	- ‚Ä¢ Loss in $DAI liquidity and demand.
	  
	  Currently the 3pool holds 1.5 billion $DAI. With incentives being moved from the 3pool to the 4pool, we can expect a significant loss of yield and hence also liquidity in the 3pool as yield farmers flock to the 4pool for the higher yields. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244269025636356))
	- A decrease in $DAI demand in conjunction with loss of liquidity could pose significant risks to the protocol.
	  
	  On top of this $UST and $FRAX partnership, there is @redactedcartel, who currently holds in excess of 1.4M $CVX and has agreed to also incentivising the 4pool. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244273001750530))
	- Surprise! That‚Äôs not all.
	  
	  Although it hasn‚Äôt been officially voted on by @OlympusDAO participants, @Ohmzeus has also shown interest in supporting the 4pool. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244275954593799))
	- If done, this will result in 4 of the top 7 DAOs by $CVX holdings funnelling incentives into the 4pool. Collectively, they hold 6M $CVX. 
	  
	  This close to guarantees that the Curve 4pool will be the deepest liquidity pool for all stableswaps. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_/status/1510244278882258944))
