document_note:: The Way of Zen by Alan Watts provides an introduction to Zen Buddhism for a western audience. It covers the history of Zen, its principles and practices, za-zen meditations, koans, and how to incorporate it into one's life. It emphasizes the importance of combining peripheral and linear thinking, not grasping at nirvana, and understanding that everything is relative and non-dual. It also emphasizes the idea that all beings are endowed with a Buddha nature, and that the contemplation of right and wrong is a sickness of the mind.

		- **Note**: Real nirvana cannot be achieved through desire, as it will only lead to more suffering. It must be experienced without any preconceived ideas or expectations.
	- Everything is relative, non dual. Things can only exist in relation to others. Only when we begin classifying things does duality arise ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gskfarqadm0axwq3g5s2y7z0))
