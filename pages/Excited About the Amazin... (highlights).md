- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Mar 16th, 2023]]
	- Excited about the amazing field of Symbolic Regression (data -> equation) with the release of our Î¦-SO approach ? Check out these resources for more on SR:
	  
	  (By the way, if you're in astronomy can you guess the equation being recovered by Î¦-SO here ? ðŸ‘‡) https://t.co/73bUdAhaMZ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/astro_wassim/status/1635696536733593618))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- @w_la_cava's 2021 benchmark of SR algorithms is a must-read! Can't wait for the updated version! https://t.co/XQU7FNzHaM
	  
	  If like me, you're mostly interested by physics, you should check out performances on equations from Feynman's bachelor lvl book ðŸ‘‡

	- Regarding SR methods themselves, I have to mention B. Petersen, @Landajuela_M et al who pioneered the Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to SR with their risk seeking policy ! DSR paper: https://t.co/ahZ5Th9uQX

	- Of course, there is also the well known Eureqa software by @eureqa and @hodlipson which greatly popularised SR! Eureqa uses a Genetic Programming (GP) approach relying on schemes inspired by natural selection (mutation, reproduction etc.).

	- More recent GP approaches to SR include the efficient PySR package by @MilesCranmer, QLattice by @AbzuAI, GP-GOMEA by @MarcoVirgolin and @PeterANBosman, Operon by M. Kommenda et al, gplearn by @trevs  and much more !

	- You can also simplify problems before SR by testing for separability, symmetry, etc. with the powerful AI Feynman by SM Udrescu and @tegmark. Don't forget to check out AI Feynman 2.0 too!

	- If you're more into supervised learning, check out:
	- You can also check out @Landajuela_M, C. Lee et al's awesome new paper where they present a unified approach combining RL, GP, AI Feynman's simplification schemes and a supervised model:
