- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Dec 28th, 2022]]
	- Here are the 5 best papers I read in 2022 that you should read too:
	  
	  1. "The Economics of Intangible Capital" by Crouzet, Eberly, Eisfeldt, and Papanikolaou

		- **Note**: Thread
	- This is kind of a two-for-one. The JEP above has the words, and there is an NBER WP with a model 
	  
	  I get stuck in the mud when thinking about intangible capital. This paper helped me pull together ideas that I'd come across but not quite synthesized.

	- 2. "Rising Markups or Changing Technology?" by Foster, Haltiwanger, and Tuttle
	  
	  Everyone knows markups are rising. Right? Right? 
	  
	  With Census data, they no longer find rising markups in manufacturing but possibly falling (red line below) https://t.co/fKNTYvQefy

	- 3. "Surging Business Formation in the Pandemic: Causes and Consequences" by Decker and Haltiwanger
	  
	  Preliminary data suggests the long decline in business dynamism has reversed. Happy days are here again? Maybe not but good news. @UpdatedPriors

	- I did a thread when I first saw the paper https://t.co/z2qK3rQQJO ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianCAlbrecht/status/1607746266813059073))
	- 4. "A Microfoundation for the Conduct Parameter Approach: Game Theory is Not Necessary to Introduce Imperfect Competition in Economics" by @taka_adachi 
	  
	  I'm constantly looking for how to break down complicated models into Econ 101 terms. I want to draw curves for everything.

	- I'd also recommend Adachi's other work on incorporating imperfect competition into supply and demand type analysis. https://t.co/bZxc4BQjp2
	  
	  E.g., "Chicago Price Theory Meets Imperfect Competition: A Common Ownership Approach"  https://t.co/agz9jOgMrQ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianCAlbrecht/status/1607746271221288961))
	- 5. "U.S. Market Concentration and Import Competition" by Amiti and Heise
	  
	  Once we account for imports and exports, concentration in manufacturing is falling over time! Talk about overturning the narrative.

	- I wrote a newsletter summarizing different literature on concentration and concluded with Amiti and Heise

	- It was a transition year for my research and reading. I'm reading less pure theory and more empirical papers. I know more about NAICS and SOC than I ever imagined a year ago. But it's been a lot of fun!

	- @taka_adachi I was looking for the published version or even one with names(!) but didn't have any luck ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianCAlbrecht/status/1607927954482335749))
