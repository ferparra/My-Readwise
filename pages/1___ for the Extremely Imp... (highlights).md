	- 1/ For the extremely impatient lunatics on my timeline, a digestible explanation as to why the Luna burn is value additive to @terra_money (hint: it's not increasing UST marketcap): https://t.co/iMCyWQ8161 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1462063952616165379))

	- 2/ First, it creates *billions* in cashflows for luna stakers over the next 2 years and makes Luna a highly countercyclical asset. 
	  
	  After col-5, all swap fees for burning Luna to Terra get paid out to Luna stakers spread out over 2 years. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1462063954780377091))
	- 3/ The staking rewards are paid out in UST, which makes Luna pretty unique among PoS assets in paying out double digit (13% pa so far) in non-recursive assets
	  
	  This makes Luna *countercyclical* to market downturns - when Luna price goes down, staking returns go up linearly ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1462063957385039883))
	- 4/ Other staking assets don't have this property - in literally any other PoS system, price falls of the native staking asset also decreases the staking reward, as the basis is the same
	  
	  The community burn makes Luna a significantly more resilient asset to downturns ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1462063959171899398))
	- 5/ Second, it's important to observe what the community does with the new 4-5B in UST to be minted - obviously creating 5B UST in a vacuum doesn't really do anything
	  
	  I've hinted that: 
	  1. The CP will protect against depeg risk of UST 
	  2. Insurance
	  3. Aid multichain expansion ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1462063960845291530))
	- 6/ On depeg risk - I've grown quite tired of arguing with idiots on Twitter on whether UST can remain stable in bear.
	  
	  So soon I will propose creating multi billion dollar reserves in decentralized assets (BTC and others) in an attempt to save myself time. More to follow. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1462063962506338318))
	- 7/ Insurance - Ozone x @riskharbor - Terra will be the most secure chain to deploy apps and $UST the safest asset once this goes live (wen? wait till burn finishes) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1462063964183924740))
	- 8/ Aid multichain expansion - if the last 12 months of Terra was focused on cultivating the economy domestic of the Terra chain, we will soon have the right infrastructure to support massive expansion of UST on other major chains - the goal is to have $UST everywhere ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1462063965866016773))
	- 9/ Some community pool $UST will be used to create deep liquidity for pools in multiple smart contract ecosystems, such that builders can access the leader in decentralized money on any chain ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1462063968407601154))
	- 10/ A couple weeks ago i said we are in the middle of a show - wait till the end before commenting ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1462063970118889472))
	- 11/ And lastly, Messrs cockroach, while it may be the great honor of your life to be chewed out on public Twitter by the Stablekwon, if I haven't done it yet its because you weren't noticeable
	  
	  In your FUD try harder - the moon in its time will certainly will give no quarter ðŸŒ• ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1462063971653931014))
