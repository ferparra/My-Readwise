	  Say you're 46. Say you're 50. So this is the trap is by comparing yourself to other people, it's going to diminish your sense of self. It pulls you out of that optimistic mode. And the reality is I may never make a film as good as Citizen Kane. I may never be as good as Walt Disney. That's my the real person I'm chasing. I may never accomplish what Elon Musk has accomplished. And so I do the thought exercise. And the words I want to introduce to people are, and now what? So you're never going to be whoever it is that you look up to and you admire. You're never going to be as good as him. And now what? Do you give up? Do you cry all day? Do you accept a lesser life? Or do you go ham? And so the thing that I want people to understand, you can get 100 times better at whatever. Now, most people spend so much time lamenting that they'll never be as good as whatever person it is that they look up to and fantasize about and want to be that they never 100 extra own abilities. And so their life is far less than it could have been. So what I have found through experience, even though I still feel the sting of not being as good as the people that I admire or having to face that Disney Walt Disney had done way more than I've done by this point in his life. Even if he didn't have as much money as I have, he certainly had built something far more that represented what he wanted to do far more than what I've done.

	  Right? My whole life has been about finally getting to that moment and I haven't.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  And maybe it forever recedes into the distance. But what I've learned through experience is the act of going ham is so intoxicating, is so fun that it is the juice, but most people are broken emotionally by the comparison. And so to some extent, you just can't allow yourself to do it.
