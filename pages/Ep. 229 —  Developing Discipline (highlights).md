	  We call this differential analysis. You want to figure out, okay, of the multiple people in a similar space who also wanted a similar position, what did this person do differently than everyone else that allowed them to get it? Was this particular skill? They had exhibited a contract flow that was this high. They had this credential the other people didn't have. What is the difference? That's what you want to get at. What this person did, that other people who did not get a similar position did not do. So it's a differential analysis. So you don't want to just grab random things that seems appealing or useful about this person you're studying. You want to figure out the things that actually mattered. So concrete evidence is what I keep coming back to. It's the very best way to not only transition to a new job or new position. It also is what gives you the motivation to do it. Your mind is smart. If it knows you're making things up, you are going to find procrastination rearing its head. You're going to find motivation hard to muster. If on the other hand, you have ironclad evidence from investigative reporting of real people with real positions of what they did and what they did differently than other people who didn't get the job. And by the way, feel free to ask people exactly that question. As you stepped from here to here, what did you do that other people didn't?
