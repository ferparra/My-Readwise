	  Is it fair to summarize that as the cost of experimentation has gone up a lot and so everyone is just realizing we have to experiment less and focus more on the core thing that we're good at and if so what are the pros and cons of that in your mind some experimentation seems really good but obviously a lot of the experimentation that happened that's probably not even a fair word it was just craziness crazy projects being funded so how do you think about that dynamic of the cost of capital affecting how much exploratory action companies take.

	  Yeah I think it definitely has responded to the cost of capital it became more expensive to do things because money became more expensive and the alternatives for sitting on your hands and buying tea bills all of a sudden got more promising. In terms of the consequences of it I don't think we've completely wiped out desire for innovation and risk taking I think there's a fair amount of it my sense is that people are still planting wheat and corn and soybean fields but they're not just throwing chaff in the air and hoping it drifts on the wind and ends up growing in something that is a crop that people could use there was too much of that and it feels very healthy to me and I would draw a contrast Patrick maybe with the and these are long cycles I draw contrast with the oil and gas industry where for years for a long time for much of my investing career exploration and production companies were valued based on reserve life increases to reserves and how much they were growing production with little concern for the true economics of Finding new wells it was just deemed that oil was valuable always would be and finding more of it was a good thing and whoever found more of it faster was valued the most highly because that was the skill that people rewarded in the marketplace and now we've just seen this radical change in terms of people's long-term estimation of the value of fossil fuels and I know we could debate what that is but there's no doubt that that's happened in the marketplace so all of these companies said our primary goal is not to have a press release that says we just grew our production 27% and we found this new field our primary goal is to say we're going to grow our cash flow 27% and we're going to return 20% of the 10 investors and I actually would say that in the oil and gas Arena if the scale ran left to right it's moved very sharply back to the left having been on the right whereas I feel like in technology e-commerce things like that we were on the extreme right of the barbell distribution but now we've just did back more towards the middle we're not over on the left yet ([Time 0:06:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4bd75f87-1143-43c6-a733-fa65113a0344))
	- The Systems Bible

	  Ever that book the systems Bible I reference it all the time I love it yes I know I ordered it I haven't ready yet the lesson in there that stands out is that every successful complex system evolves from a simple system to start you can't airdrop in a complex system like it just does not work it will not hold and that's another way of saying the same thing you're saying I think about meta whereas AWS was an organic outgrowth in 2005 or six or whatever of the retail infrastructure basically to be humble for both of us though about the fact that we may be wrong I do have one good counterfactual I think which is Reliance Enterprises the Indian conglomerate years ago they thought ([Time 0:31:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6aa4eca1-46d5-4c80-b23d-d1175217b89e))
