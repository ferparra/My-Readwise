	- Is There a Way to Solve the Problems?
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* We need to be looking at all of the different approaches that are available to us in order to solve the problems that we face., * We need to continue to move away from conventional agriculture, which is not able to keep up with the increasing demand for meat., * We need to create new products that blend properties from different animals, in order to appease both vegans and meateaters.)

	  Yeah, I don't think that any one technique or approach on its own is going to solve the problems that we have. I think that we actually need, you know, all of a sudden, for example, when it comes to fishing, I think that the price that we pay for a wild caught, let's say salmon, should be far higher than what it is. People who are stewards of the ocean who care about the numbers of fish that they pull out of the water every year who, you know, are really attuned to this, should be able to command a premium, I think, that is far greater than what we have now and what people are used to paying. And so I think that, you know, the only way to really address this is with approaches. And I actually really applaud the efforts of of general agriculture. I think it's incredible. And this is definitely the direction we should be moving when it comes to conventional agriculture. It's just not clear to me if that on its own is going to be able to keep up with the increasing demand.

	  Arlene and Corvallis Ergin, you're next. Hi, Arlene. Hi.
	  
	  Speaker 5
	  Hi, go for it.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Thank you.
	  
	  Speaker 5
	  Yeah, so my first comment is about something that was discussed earlier about why wouldn't a vegan or a vegetarian eat this product. And I think you're missing a key point that one of the reasons people choose to not eat meat is because we don't want the flesh of an animal in our mouth to begin with. We just don't agree with consuming animals, period, right? So I think you kind of missed that point. Secondly, the idea of creating a new product that maybe blends properties from different animals, to me that sounds like a slippery slope as well because you're introducing the idea of consuming an animal that might not have been previously consumed. And if that is something that is desirable after consuming that, that that might perpetuate, you know, the harvest of those animals, whether they're wild or otherwise. So just wanted to put those two thoughts up there. Thanks for that contribution, Andrew. Any reaction?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, no, I think they're both really great points. I think that from the perspective of, you know, why vegans and vegetarians might not choose to consume these products and touching back on one of the earlier questions and points that was brought up. You know, I think a lot of people in the field kind of say, you know, if you're vegan and you don't want to try this product, awesome, you know, getting back to that caloric efficiency, we can maybe do better than a cow, but we'll never do better than a plant on a caloric efficiency, right? Because one calorie of a plant is one calorie of a plant. So from a, from an environmental standpoint, you know, for people that are happy just consuming plants, then, you know, by all means continue to live that lifestyle. And you know, I think that's incredible and wonderful. It's more to Aria's point for the people who, who don't make that change. And due to the fact that the trends we keep seeing that the population on a whole is moving away from that direction rather than towards that direction.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Well, well, how many years down the road do you imagine that it'll take cell ag meat to be affordable to the average person and in competition with actual meat market?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, yeah. I go ahead. No, no, I was going to, I was going to plead the fifth on the question. So I thought, are you?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Yeah, you want to tackle that? ([TimeÂ 0:42:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f6ce89e6-4b37-48b9-b2e3-5b295500f60d))
