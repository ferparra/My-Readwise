	- **The third and final truth: If you learn to enjoy the scent of a thousand flowers you will not cling to one or suffer when you cannot get it**. If you have a thousand favorite dishes, the loss of one will go unnoticed and leave your happiness unimpaired. But it is precisely your attachments that prevent you from developing a wider and more varied taste for things and people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1bb6g6ywdjcfm7j6mq0f40))
	- Who decides what will finally make its way to your conscious mind from all the material that is pouring in from the world? Three decisive filters: first your attachments, second your beliefs and third your fears. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1bbdkf1v9htwj874v5ydn0))
	- True happiness is uncaused. You are happy for no reason at all. And true happiness cannot be experienced. It is not within the realm of consciousness. It is unself-consciousness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1bbmpwqj5q0vdwk8qtww0h))

	- **So the first ingredient of love is to really see the other. The second ingredient is equally important to see yourself, to ruthlessly flash the light of awareness on your motives, your emotions, your needs, your dishonesty, your self-seeking, your tendency to control and manipulate.** This means calling things by their name, no matter how painful the discovery and the consequences. If you achieve this kind of awareness of the other and yourself, you will know what love is. For you will have attained a mind and a heart that is alert, vigilant, clear, sensitive, a clarity of perception, a sensitivity that will draw out of you an accurate, appropriate response to every situation at every moment.

	- Each time you attempt that task you will understand that what clear thinking calls for is not intelligence‚Äîthat is easily come by‚Äîbut the courage that has successfully coped with fear and with desire, for the moment you desire something or fear something, your heart will consciously or unconsciously get in the way of your thinking.

		- **Note**: When you try to think clearly, it's not your intelligence that matters, but your courage. When you fear something or want something, your feelings can get in the way of your thinking.
	- Effort does not lead to growth; effort, whatever the form it may take, whether it be willpower or habit or a technique or a spiritual exercise, does not lead to change. At best it leads to repression and a covering over of the root disease. Effort may change the behavior but it does not change the person.
