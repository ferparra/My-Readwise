- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Dec 1st, 2022]]
	- The success of spreadsheets demonstrates that users can make effective use of open-ended programmability—to speed computations, explore what-if scenarios, and have thoughts they wouldn’t have had using their analog predecessor (a paper grid and manual calculations).
	- When software allows adding dynamic behavior as part of gradual enrichment, it supports programming in the moment.
	- What the hand does, the mind remembers.

	- Nascent ideas are tiny, weak, and fragile. They require attention, nimbleness, and open-ended thought to survive.
	- we built Inkbase, a native Swift application for the Apple iPad and Pencil, implementing a programmable sketchbook
	- everything in Lisp is an expression (everything returns a value), which composes nicely with the idea of reactive properties
	- Paper notebooks are a great place to sketch out designs, though they remain static. The only way to adjust them is to draw them again, and there’s no way to simulate behavior. Sometimes you want to build a model and play with it to better understand the constraints or behavior of a system.
	- There’s a reason so many innovations and discoveries have been based on back-of-the-envelope calculations—paper is great for this mode of thought.
	- convolution has an intuitive feeling. Convolution “smears out” one function, using a second function—the kernel—as a template for the smearing
	- In research we often have under-constrained design spaces to explore. We sometimes use the ingredients analogy at the lab for thinking about the design of a tool—some ingredients are essential to the nature of the thing (apples for apple pie), some are necessary for it to work (leavening agent for bread), some don’t work well together (lemon juice and milk—unless curdling is intended), some don’t taste good together (garlic and chocolate), and some need to be used judiciously (ginger).
	- the microworld, where powerful building blocks are available to be combined in unanticipated ways.
	- Microworlds, introduced specifically in an educational context by Seymour Papert in his seminal book Mindstorms, are tiny worlds inside which a student can explore alternatives, test hypotheses, and discover facts that are true about that world in their pursuit of learning goals, problem-solving, and creative activities.
	- in Inkbase, the pre-built microworlds are used inside of an environment that is itself a fully programmable system
	- This sense of intimacy and working with the material could be enhanced by a number of improvements to the tool, especially around making your work always feel safe (such as unlimited undo) and making as much of the program as possible be visible on the canvas and manipulable with the same hand-tools as ink.
	- Good tools for thought are as much about helping you manage your headspace as anything else, and adding dynamic behavior just as needed allows you to stay in your current headspace rather than switching to a programming one.
