document_note:: This document provides an overview of Ken Wilber's theory of an integrated, unified view of the cosmos. It introduces the concept of "spiral dynamics", which is a model of eight levels of consciousness, from Beige (survival instincts) to Turquoise (holism). It also discusses the concept of "first tier thinking" (the belief that one's own perspective is the only valid one) versus "second tier thinking" (seeing the bigger picture with understanding and empathy). It suggests that the key to advancement is helping people move up a tier, not getting a select few to the second tier. Finally, it explains the importance of understanding dominance hierarchies and actualization hierarchies.

	- Yellow - integration, living in paradox ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvxmtthk7ja2rqkd9j46x9c))
	- Turquoise - holism, all part of same living whole ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvxmwpk6xh5ft0vk8855wrz))
	- 1.  First tier thinking - every level thinks that every other level is wrong, only their way is right.
	  
	  1.  Second tier thinking, understands that all those games are necessary parts of human evolution of consciousness and people to reach this level are able to think vertically and horizontally seeing the bigger picture seeing things holistic Lee and not as black and white. This is a massive mental and consciously that is necessary to move from silos or integralism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvxn0q4c59fxp8sbhp9e2ck))
		- **Note**: The Theory of Everything is based on two tiers of thinking. The first tier is characterized by the belief that each level of thinking is the only valid one, while the second tier is able to think both vertically and horizontally, seeing the bigger picture and understanding that all levels are necessary parts of human evolution. This requires a shift in mental and conscious awareness, allowing for a holistic approach instead of a black and white one.
	- One definition of development could be viewed as a continual decline of ego centrism towards ethno-centrism to world centrism (I, we, it) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvxkj2ajzch838fs7pdkn4j))
		- **Note**: The Theory of Everything suggests that development is a gradual process of shifting from an individual-focused mindset (ego-centrism) to a group-focused mindset (ethno-centrism) and eventually to a global-focused mindset (world centrism).
