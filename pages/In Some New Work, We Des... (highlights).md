	- In some new work, we describe how generative machine learning enables the modular design of complex proteins controlled by a high-level programming language for protein design

	- Rather than use building blocks of sequence or structure, our main idea is to put the modularity at a higher level of abstraction and have black-box optimization generate the specific design. ESMFold predicts atomic-level structure at each step of the optimization. (2/N)

	- The approach allows the designer to specify arbitrary, non-differentiable constraints, which can range from specifying atomic-level coordinates to the abstract plan of the protein, like the design of symmetry. (3/N)

	- Important for programmability, the constraints are modular. Here, we apply the same constraint hierarchically to program two levels of symmetry. (4/N)

	- The constraints are also easily recombined. For example, we can combine constraints on atomic coordinates and constraints on symmetry. Or, we can combine different forms of two-level symmetry to program an asymmetric complex. (5/N)

	- We think this is a step toward more controllable, regular, and expressive protein design! Wonderful working with the @MetaAI FAIR protein team and very talented coauthors: @salcandido @ebetica @OriKabeli @proteinrosh @nikismetanin @TomSercu @alexrives (N/N)
