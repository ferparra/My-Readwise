	- The way we work has forever changed. As we think about the future of work and tools, we have an opportunity to not just translate physical experiences into digital realms, but to also make digital experiences even better than physical counterparts.

	- We want FigJam to be a fun and creative space for your team. FigJam is for the earliest stages of ideation ‚Äî a time when ideas are fragile and need nurturing. As a product, FigJam succeeds when it encourages ‚Äúyes and‚Äù thinking and open sharing of thought. (3/9) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1450522309949681666))
	- With today‚Äôs announcements, we‚Äôre doubling down on that spirit of improv and inclusivity. With widgets and plugins, anyone can add to FigJam‚Äôs capabilities. Open Sessions allows guests to come into files for 24 hours without creating an account. (4/9) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1450522311379935236))
	- Our updated pricing was designed to make it so cost is not a barrier to ideation. It‚Äôs 2021 and everyone needs access to a digital whiteboard. At $3/month for Pro and $5/month for Org, we hope that FigJam‚Äôs pricing exposes more people to design thinking. (5/9) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1450522314357960704))
	- Of course we couldn‚Äôt do any of this without @figmadesign‚Äôs amazing community.
