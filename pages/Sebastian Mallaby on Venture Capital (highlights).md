	- Do Hedge Funds Even Yield Supernormal, Positive Returns?
	  
	  Summary:
	  Do hedge funds even yield supernormal, positive returns on net? So it depends on the period you look at. An uncorrelated return which isn't driven by just the market going up is pretty hard to come by. And in terms of a big diversified pension fund or endiwament portfolio, will help your sharp ratio. It's giving you extra juice to your return, whilst without adding to risk because it's not a correlated position.

	  On the outside, here's a very easy question, adjusting for risk. Do hedge funds even yield supernormal, positive returns on net?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So it depends on the period you look at. I mean, the best way to think about supernormal positive returns is, i think, simply to say, uncorrelated return. I mean, an uncorrelated return, which isn't driven by just the market going up, is pretty hard to come by. And a normal return, i think, is zero if you're trying to do that. So any positive return which isn't correlated with the stock market bench mark, or whatever other bench mark youre choosing, is good. And in terms of a big diversified pension fund or endiwament portfolio, will help your sharp ratio, because it's giving you extra juice to your return, whilst without adding to risk, because it's not a correlated position. And so when you net out the volatility of your hedge fund exposure with all your other exposures, it's actually volatility dampening. That's the idea. So do they produce alpha? As the question. And when i published my book in two thousand ten, about hedge funds, the best research at the time said the net of tievs, there was positive alpha in three % a year between 19 95 and the late two thousand that was a pretty strong positive number. I think since two thousand ten, the positive number has declined to be much, much smaller, and maybe even to disappear in sometime periods. I think that happened because of quantitative easing. If you think about hedge funds, what is it tat they do? They get paid to assess risk and price it. And if risk spreads being squeezed and compressed and reduced to almost nothing by the central bank through quantitative easing, then hedge funds, hay, can be paid less for doing their work. Sthink that's why supernormal positive returns to use or langued, which tile have diminished, i think they may now come back because of the end of quantitative easing and the rising of interest rates in the face of inflation.
