	- I’m so proud of my dad (77 y/o)! ❤️ 
	  
	  He couldn’t do pull-ups for 6 weeks (no bar) & he’d lost about 50% of his max.
	  
	  So I introduced him to the magic of “grease the groove”. 
	  
	  Now, 2 weeks later, he just asked me “can I do this with push-ups, too?” 
	  
	  You’re never too old! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Sabine_BC/status/1327643519737970689))
