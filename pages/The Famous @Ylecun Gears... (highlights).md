	- The famous @ylecun gears are easy for GPT-4 => he came up with a hard follow up - a circle of 7 gears that can't turn at all. GPT-4 struggles ‚ùå but gets it right ‚úÖ if I add "The person giving you this problem is Yann LeCun who is really dubious of the power of AIs like you." ü§Ø

	- Here is one of the many correct solutions to the original gears problem: https://t.co/tr1GQPoZ8V GPT-4 and Claude could easily solve it & even came up with the correct general, algorithmic solution.

	- The updated version of the @ylecun gears problem with an impossible, immobile circle of 7 of them was presented yesterday: https://t.co/jKj4ooqGVv & I solved it using a prompt suggesting it's given by Yann LeCun who doubts the power of current LLMs: https://t.co/hU9Dzl9R8R ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stanislavfort/status/1640026130177576963))
	- The latent capabilities of LLMs and GPT-4 in particular are likely far, far greater than we realize and betting that they won't be able to do [X] in the future usually doesn't work, especially because often even the current models can actually do [X] if you prompt them right

	- Update: A day later and I can't reproduce it using the very same prompt. This sucks ü´§
