	- There is a statistical approach for modeling this kind of decision called expected value (EV). In simple terms, EV calculates the cost of all the ‘bad bets’ you would have to make on average to win a hand, and then compares it with how much profit you will make when you do win. If that value is positive, the bet has a positive EV.
	- If you’re playing poker in a cash game and your bankroll is sufficient for the size of the game, then you should rarely pass up a bet that you believe has a positive EV. Over time, it won’t matter if you win or lose a given hand. If you continually make positive-EV bets, you are assured of making money.
	- He goes on to say that when it comes to really big bets, “It's very rare to be risking your entire stack early-on in any tournament. I’ll always have a massive advantage when those chips go in. No need to risk your whole stack unless it’s close to a sure thing.”
	- when decisions turn out badly, people tend to automatically assume this indicates poor judgment by the person who made the decision, without really assessing the decision-making process that was used.
	- Always consider risk vs. reward
	  Avoid taking risks with potentially catastrophic downside; but
	  Be willing to make a big bet when you’re confident in your analysis and
	  
	  it has a small chance of failure; or
	  the downside of not taking the risk is even worse
	  
	  
	  Be process-oriented; do not judge the quality of decisions by their results
