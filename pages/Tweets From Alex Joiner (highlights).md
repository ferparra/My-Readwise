	- The Australian economy has delivered a record low unemployment rate accompanied by record participation and employment. In contrast to the US where a relative lack of labour supply has tightened the labour market. Where we are lagging the US for now is on resulting wages growth.

	- The #RBA's Graph 5.10 shows negative real wages in the context of its forecasts. I have reconstructed this to add some historical perspective.  
	  
	  Real wages are forecast to get back to as low as they were in 2009, an extraordinary setback for households.

	- And there it is, the first genuine pullback in retail sales since the pandemic. Much weaker than market expectation and materially erodes the ongoing spending narrative and Australia households are some how different. Should this continue the #RBA's job is largely done

	- The latest IFM Economics Quarterly - Weaker growth in 2023 represents the “cost” of central banks trying to drag inflation meaningfully lower. The question is just how high will this cost be? See link for more.

	- The RBA's forecasts in detail. A bit of marking to the data. Business investment notably weaker, the unemployment rate rising more quickly, productivity growth negligible but the wages forecast upgraded materially, seems like an optimistic expectation with downside risk
