	- 1/ I led acquisition @Bonobos—a pioneering digital  brand founded in 2007 w/ $100M+ in funding backed by @ForerunnerVC, @lightspeedvp & @Accel. Like most, while we maniacally focused on LTV:CAC, CAC received more airtime than LTV. Today, CAC doesn’t matter.

	- 2/ In the early days @Bonobos, building a brand online had never been easier, but scaling a business was hard; the challenge of cutting through the noise was limited, while the sophistication of tools and services we’ve come to expect for online business were developing.

	- 3/ Today, the inverse is true. Acquisition and distribution channels have matured over the past decade. As the bar for starting an online business has lowered, competition has intensified for consumer dollars & mindshare.

	- 5/ Yet, for digital brands on accelerated trajectories, growth still = acquisition. Even the most successful consumer cos w/ network effect, viral growth, & subscription narratives invest significantly into advertising, but those $ are largely directed to acquisition & brand.
