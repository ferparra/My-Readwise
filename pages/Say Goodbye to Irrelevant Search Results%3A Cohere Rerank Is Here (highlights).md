document_note:: Traditional keyword-based search systems often return irrelevant results, making it challenging to find the information you need. However, Cohere Rerank, a semantic-based search system, can help contextualize the meaning of a user's query beyond keyword relevance, allowing it to return more relevant and accurate results. The Rerank endpoint bridges the gap between the two search systems, allowing companies to retain their existing keyword-based or semantic search system while improving relevance and accuracy of search results. With just a single line of code added to your application, Cohere Rerank enables great search quality across languages and domains.
