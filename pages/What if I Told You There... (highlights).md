		- **Note**: Thread
	- Most people know Dharmesh as the CTO of @HubSpot.
	  
	  For those who aren't familiar, HubSpot creates software products for inbound marketing, sales, and customer service. 
	  
	  Hubspot currently has a market cap of ~$20 billion and did close to $2B in revenue in 2022. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alex_valaitis/status/1636800140198412297))
	- Dharmesh co-founded HubSpot in 2006, after selling his first company Pyramid Digital Solutions.
	  
	  He was just 24 years old when he launched Pyramid, and it was doing $15M in annual revenue when he sold
	  
	  It took him less than a year to start Hubspot with Brian Halligan

	- 99% of founders would have probably packed it in after a win like HubSpot. But not Dharmesh.
	  
	  His insatiable curiosity for tech, has allowed him to continue to launch one successful product after the next.
	  
	  Let's dive into some of them... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alex_valaitis/status/1636800153792151557))
	- During the Wordle craze, Dharmesh built a python project to help teach his son about coding
	  
	  He realized that there was an opportunity to position the app as a better alternative to Wordle
	  
	  A few months later https://t.co/DzKV5WxIkP, had over 6M+ users & did $90K/month in revenue

	- Dharmesh has also taken an interest in the latest breakthroughs in AI.
	  
	  He's been pulling late-nights to help personally build Hubspot's newest AI tool 'ChatSpot'.
	  
	  The tool combines your CRM data with ChatGPT to ask questions/provide instructions in natural language https://t.co/dH9xguzOcY ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alex_valaitis/status/1636800163330117632))
	- On top of building these projects, Dharmesh also has a great eye for tech startups
	  
	  His personal investment portfolio includes companies like: @coinbase, @okta, @AngelList, and more.
	  
	  He also owns a portfolio of web domains in the millions of $ (check out https://t.co/GzGo1zoZaG)

	- Now that you know what Dharmesh has accomplished, I think it's worth taking a look into why he's been so successful.
	  
	  Out of all the entrepreneurs I've studied, Dharmesh seems to have the best handle on the first principles behind building a successful product/company... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alex_valaitis/status/1636800176030351375))
	- Here's one crisply articulated insight by Dharmesh:
	  
	  A large part of his entrepreneurial success has been a function of his willingness to make meaningful iterations to his product based on tight feedback loops.

	- And here's Dharmesh explaining how startups can mitigate market risk by:
	  
	  1. Charging customers early + never free (he even charges his wife for his product ðŸ˜‚)
	  
	  2. Charging often (ensures customers continue to remain satisfied each month)

	- Dharmesh's blog and YouTube channels are a wealth of knowledge.
	  
	  (He's only at 11K subs on YouTube, which feels criminal)
	  
	  If you want to learn how to build a successful startup, this should be one of the first places your start ðŸ‘‡

	- In a society that seems to be inundated with charlatans (& outright frauds), it's important that people are know of people like Dharmesh who is the real deal.
	  
	  I highly recommend that everyone gives him a follow.
	  
	  In the mean time I'll be continuing to follow his journey in awe. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alex_valaitis/status/1636800185400426509))
