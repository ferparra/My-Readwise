	- The concept of [[neuroplasticity]] says that experiences can actually change the structure and function of your brain.
	  
	  Your actions shape your reality.
	  
	  If you act like the person you want to become, you will become that person. https://t.co/VvEgBGBQmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1616433960300470272))

	- Who you are today is a direct result of the actions you took one year ago.
	  
	  Who you will be in one year is a direct result of the actions you take today.
	  
	  Those who understand this operate on another level. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1616435743869788161))
	- The Law of Growth (from 12 Laws of Karma)
	  
	  The shift in our internal reality through progress, growth, and change shifts our external reality.
	  
	  We only control our daily actions, not those of the external actors in our lives.
	  
	  Focus internally to see progress externally. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1616436356133036033))
	- Actions done once are rarely enough to create these structural changes in our brains.
	  
	  Actions must be taken again and again.
	  
	  This is the reason disciplined people win across domains. They take the daily actions necessary to alter their reality. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1616440191413260289))
	- I like the analogy of carving a new path through the woods:
	  
	  The first time is very difficult— the trees, debris, and brush all make your passage challenging.
	  
	  The second time is a bit easier.
	  
	  The tenth time is smooth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1616446016542343168))
	- This is why the idea of manifestation is interesting to me.
	  
	  But it’s not enough to write down or say what you want to become.
	  
	  You have to take action.
	  
	  @thesamparr is a big believer in manifestation—but his manifestation successes were always grounded in action and movement. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1616463275742330881))
