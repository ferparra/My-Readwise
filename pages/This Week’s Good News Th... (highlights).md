		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ Well, that de-escalated quickly
	  
	  Daily infections in the United States have crashed by 50 percent in just two months. That's like the WeWork of infection drops
	  
	  What Delta giveth, Delta taketh away

	- 2/ Now check out Florida, the Delta epicenter and anti-masking motherland
	  
	  How is the Sunshine State going? 
	  
	  Pretty well it seems
	  
	  Pretty, pretty, pretty well
	  
	  Florida, which bans masks has about 80% less infections than Victoria, which forces 9 year olds to wear masks

	- 3/ The fourth horseman has arrived. With little fanfare, Novavax has finally applied for approval from the TGA (as well as in the UK)
	  
	  Six months ago this would have been a huge deal. With Australia awash with more vaccines than arms, now not so much...

	- 4/ The ACT has quietly become the most vaccinated region on earth (only Gibraltar, Pitcairn and UAE are reporting higher, but that was due to boosters or questionable counting)
	  
	  99.23% of every single Canberran over 12 (note: not sure if that's actually a word) has had a dose

	- 5/ NSW and Victoria (which should jump ahead next week) aren‚Äôt to far behind the ACT
	  
	  Both would be in the Top 10 Democratic countries globally by 1st Dose Rate:

	- 6/ On 5 August, Bill Bowtell said:
	  
	  ‚ÄúWe cannot vaccinate our way out of this crisis‚Ä¶the only person who holds that view is the premier of NSW‚Äù
	  
	  This is why a guy who‚Äôs only qualification is a 1975 Arts Degree shouldn‚Äôt dictate health policy via The Project:

	- 7/ Victorians seem to be coming to their senses
	  
	  The bloke who shut playground and schools, only to create the country‚Äôs worst Covid crisis (twice) has the lowest Covid approval rate by the length of the Flemington Straight 
	  
	  Which ironically Dan never shut, unlike schools...

	- 8/ Covid Zero is dead, buried and cremated
	  
	  SA, Tasmania, Queensland will all be open by mid-Dec
	  
	  McGowan will be forced to open in January when FIFO gazillionaires see everyone else sinking $1 Bintangs on Kuta Beach and they‚Äôre still paying $15 for a bottle of Little Creatures

	- 9/ Singapore infections plateaued (3,500 per day)
	  
	  Important: Singapore has done a terrible job at vaccinating the elderly. Only 87% of over 70s have been vaxxed (over 95% in Australia). 
	  
	  Don‚Äôt be fooled by Singapore‚Äôs high vax rate (83%) ‚Äì they‚Äôve vaccinated the wrong people

	- 10/ Remember the Tokyo Olympics and the State of Emergency? 
	  
	  Can put those sirens away now 
	  
	  Side note: Japan removed virtually all restrictions a month ago. Cases continued to plummet (only 71.5% double dosed, less than NSW and Victoria)

	- 11/ It wouldn‚Äôt be a Good News Thread‚Ñ¢ without mentioning the b√™te noire of the Covid Fatalists ‚Äì Sweden
	  
	  The place that never locked down continues to be ‚Äòsmashed‚Äô by the wicked virus
	  
	  If by ‚Äòsmashed‚Äô we mean 4.4 octogenarians dying each day in a country of 10 million

	- 12/ Infections in UK school kids continue to rise, but the far more important hospitalisations number remains as steady as a mountain goat
	  
	  In Melbourne, the Royal Children's Hospital tested 15,000 kids and said only one kid went to ICU last year, who recovered 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FC-HjEwWYAMvxYW.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lux_schwab/status/1454541051658653697))
	- 13/ The UK itself is proof that focusing only on infection rates is a fool‚Äôs errand. The more important metric is the ‚Äòpositivity rate‚Äô, which in UK is 5.1%
	  
	  This is lower than the oft praised Germany (8.3%), Ireland (9.6%), Norway (8%), Finland (5.2%) and Belgium (9.2%) 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FC-H0sOWUAkYo5t.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lux_schwab/status/1454541055077097474))
	- 14/ It would be remiss not to point out how wrong UK SAGE were (again)
	  
	  This dire model was only prepared six weeks ago (not long after their previous model was shown to be wrong)
	  
	  In Sep, Sage predicted 7,000 daily hospitalisations ‚Äì there were less than 900 last week
	  
	  Whoops

	- 15/ Finally @liammannix said that media coverage of Covid is too negative
	  
	  He's absolutely right of course, but clearly Liam hasn‚Äôt been reading this thread
	  
	  C‚Äômon Liam
