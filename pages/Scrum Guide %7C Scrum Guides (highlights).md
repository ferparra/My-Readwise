	- The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to
	  improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the
	  Scrum Team.
	- The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the
	  Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility
	  in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it.
	- An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each
	  Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified,
	  ensuring that all Increments work together.
