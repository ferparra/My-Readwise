	  I'm your host, Shane Parrish. This podcast is about mastering the best what other people have already figured out, so you can apply their insights to your life. If you're listening to this, you're missing out. If you'd like access to the podcast before public release, private episodes that only appear in your feed, hand edited transcripts, including my personal highlights, and more you can join at fs.blog slash membership. Check out the show notes for link. My guest today is Dr. Emily Vellchettis, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology at New York University. Dr. Vellchettis specializes in how our perception of the world influences our persistence and motivation. The perception gap is the difference between what we see and what is. And understanding this gap not only explains why we sometimes have trouble getting started or finishing, but how we can use it to our advantage. This episode is about achievement and getting better results. It's about how our perception and where we focus changes not only our motivation to work toward our goals, but how hard we work and the pain or pleasure we experience as we work.

	- The Power of Impossible Goals
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Sub goals work because they move the finish line slightly farther than where we are, and we are more motivated to accomplish them., * When we have a goal that feels impossible, we give up before we've even started.)

	  So as part of the reason that the sub goals work then is that we're really just moving the finish line slightly farther than where we are. So we're more motivated to accomplish it. And then we're tricking ourselves in resetting once we reach that sub goal to the next goal.

	  Yeah, I think there's a couple of things that are implicated here is that if we have a goal that seems impossible, if we construe this is really far, if you just looked at what 26.2 miles looks like to you, that might look really far, impossibly far. And colleagues of mine at New York University have found that when we construe goals at that level, when they feel at that level of impossibility, we give up before we've even gotten started. That they've looked at systolic blood pressure as a physiological indicator of our psychological readiness to do something.
