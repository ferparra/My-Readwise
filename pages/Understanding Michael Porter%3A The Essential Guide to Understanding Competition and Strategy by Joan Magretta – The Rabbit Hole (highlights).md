	- “The essence of strategy,” Porter often says, “is choosing what not to do.”
	- One of the important lessons about strategy is that if you’re pursuing a different positioning, then different metrics will be relevant. And if you force everybody to show progress on the same metrics, you encourage convergence and undermine strategic uniqueness.
	- The essence of strategy is to create your own path.
	- Only by competing to be unique can an organization achieve sustained, superior performance.
	- Porter’s prescription: aim to be unique, not best. Creating value, not beating rivals, is at the heart of competition.
	- These five forces—the intensity of rivalry among existing competitors, the bargaining power of buyers (the industry’s customers), the bargaining power of suppliers, the threat of substitutes, and the threat of new entrants—determine the industry’s structure,
	- Making trade-offs means accepting limits—saying no to some customers, for example, so that you can better serve others. Trade-offs arise when choices are incompatible. Because a successful strategy will attract imitators, choices that are difficult to copy are essential.
	- Good strategies depend on the connection among many things, on making interdependent choices.
	- Continuity over time – if your company can achieve this, it has a robust, stable core but is also able to innovate and adapt
	- Focus refers to the breadth or narrowness of the customers and needs a company serves. Differentiation allows a company to command a premium price. Cost leadership allows it to compete by offering a low relative price.
