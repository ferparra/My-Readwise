	- In this paper is proposed HQNNA, a CNN accelerator based on non-coherent silicon photonics that can accelerate both homogeneously quantized and heterogeneously quantized CNN models.

	- HQNNA utilizes wavelength-division multiplexing along with time-division multiplexing for bit-slicing-based operation for heterogeneously quantized CNN acceleration. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Underfox3/status/1556280794368413698))
	- The proposed photonic accelerator achieves up to 73.8x better energy-per-bit and 159.5x better throughput-energy efficiency than state-of-the-art photonic CNN accelerators.
