	- 1/ 🧵Discussion from this AM: Good early stage SaaS startup engineering today is a game of intelligently walking the tightrope of shipping speed and scalability/quality. Most fall off on the wrong side (the latter). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/saranormous/status/1399747675851956227))

	- 2/ Teams need to A) stand up end-to-end systems in order to learn from users as quickly as possible and B) rapidly rebuild, rearchitect, deepen parts of the product as they learn about requirements. Who is responsible for those two opposing forces in your company? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/saranormous/status/1399747676862771201))
	- 3/ We’re collectively making better software because this iteration loop is so much less costly than it was 5 years ago — due to cloud scalability, web distribution, early adopter startup customers, and microservices architectures. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/saranormous/status/1399747677785509889))
	- 4/ Clearly, experience can help avoid some really painful rewrites (and set up good cycles for handling them), but many companies with “great FANGG engineering teams” never get a product to grow — ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/saranormous/status/1399747678729248777))
	- 5/ — in part because they’ve prematurely misallocated attention to scalability and quality of the core product vs the growth hypothesis and open-minded customer understanding. Focus on sunk cost and “sticking to the hypothesis” is deadly if the customer doesn’t see the value. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/saranormous/status/1399747679563915269))
	- 6/ Technically great teams will hear from customers, “if you just did X…” and keep walking down the same dead end. Especially if your entry point is with individuals or the SMB/midmarket/startups, the initial use case for your product can be a very thin but still resonant wedge. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/saranormous/status/1399747680440524801))
	- 7/ Most SaaS products are *not direct replacements.* If a customer tells you the product is incomplete, consider making it compelling/frictionless/possible to use even through incomplete. If this can’t be done — consider whether the hypothesis is wrong. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/saranormous/status/1399747681371623424))
	- 8/ Inexperience can be a counterintuitive advantage. Rewiring a flying plane is terrifying, and teams that are ready to accept that a lot of code will be thrown away chasing product-market fit, thrive. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/saranormous/status/1399747682281803778))
	- 9/ Resource constraints can also be a counterintuitive advantage for engineering teams. Companies overcapitalized early don’t *need* to prove demand hypotheses. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/saranormous/status/1399747683154161668))
	- 10/ They can build a team too big to move quickly, a platform without a clear killer application, a business that has a cost structure they can’t support — and they can run too quickly at weak/wishful thinking demand signals. Wasting time and money. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/saranormous/status/1399747684018233348))
	- 11/ Consumer founders seem to be especially well prepared for this - given one successful MO is to continually throw stuff at the wall and then desperately try to scale it if one iteration hits a nerve, and there’s no intellectual dishonesty possible about what is “working.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/saranormous/status/1399747684878086155))
	- 12/ Like consumer, Bottoms-up SaaS is initially also about “hitting a nerve,” — with the advantages of users having clear jobs-to-be-done. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/saranormous/status/1399747685813395458))
	- 13/13 “Focus on hitting a nerve” doesn’t mean the “level of craft” doesn’t matter in SaaS — it just can be secondary to the core value and appropriate scoping and sequencing. Similarly, designing a product to sequence INTO a platform > designing a platform upfront. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/saranormous/status/1399747686681636864))
