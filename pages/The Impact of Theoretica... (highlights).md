	- The impact of theoretical physics on generative AI is notable. 
	  
	  Max welling, father of variational auto-encoders, did his PhD in quantum gravity with Gerard 't Hooft.
	  
	  Surya Ganguli, father of diffusion models, did his PhD in string theory with Petr Horava.
	  
	  A coincidence? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cpheinrich/status/1605432221539500032))

	- There is nothing particularly quantum gravityish about either of those results. Although the diffusion models do directly import physics ideas, it does make you wonder whether some physics intuition is useful for developing these types of models.
