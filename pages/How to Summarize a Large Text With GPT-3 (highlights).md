document_note:: GPT-3 with Davinci 3 is a powerful tool for quickly and accurately summarizing large texts. This article provides a guide to using GPT-3 to generate a summary or blog post from a text of over 4000 tokens. The process involves splitting the text into smaller chunks and using Python to write the summarized files into a single text file. GPT-3 can then be used on this final file to generate an engaging summary. The article also covers the use cases of GPT-3 and how it can be applied to create blog post snippets, highlight key points for research papers, and more.

	  ***Step 2:***
	  
	  Use Python to split the large text file into smaller chunks, that can be saved into separate text files.
	  
	  ***Step 3:***
	  
	  Enter each of the chunks into GPT3 and summarize them.
	  
	  ***Step 4:***
	  
	  Use Python to synthesize the summarized chunks into a single, compressed text file.
	  
	  ***Step 5:***
