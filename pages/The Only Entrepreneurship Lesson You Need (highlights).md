	- When I was first getting into [[entrepreneurship]], I asked
	  
	  [Mark Cuban](https://medium.com/u/29fd628f3aaa?source=post_page-----105d9e3bcf5a--------------------------------)
	  
	  what he read or studied to learn how to start and build businesses. His response:
	  
	  > “[[Experience]]. It’s the only reliable teacher I’ve ever had. No books ever captured what it’s really like. You just gotta do it.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grmb8sa6drn950km30ayjkra))

	- [[Reading]] is NEVER a replacement for doing, but reading can be how you figure out where to start. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grmb9s1hfy0agmksak3w07a1))
	- You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with **good people**, to **make something customers actually want**, and to **spend as little money as possible**. Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one of these. A startup that does all three will probably succeed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grmba7cadebymsq07gmm6b9b))

	- Paul Graham likes to talk about it in terms of finding people who are resourceful and determined. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grmbb2n6ccf5f6tp37r71s7s))
	- No matter who you are and where you start in life, you can display those attributes. If you start poor and disenfranchised, you have a ton of opportunities to show them; basically, your whole life is using determination to overcome obstacles with few resources. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grmbby43jbc823jggmckb3bz))
	- If you start rich and privileged, you can show these attributes as well, just in different ways. For example, by learning a lot of new things, by taking advantage of the opportunities in front of you, and by creating things from those resources you have.

	- *startups are not about ideas.* They’re about solving problems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grmbcj2hrv0t7vw7rwvvc5ss))
	- A startup’s only purpose is to find a commercially viable solution to a real human problem. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grmbcrz2tpx2nwa1m7zx3ypz))

	- “I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlooked problems © that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver them as informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version 1, then (f) iterating rapidly.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grmbdc7d3hz9bztjbvc4vm01))

	- What is product-market fit? Andreessen says:
	  
	  > “Product/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market…The life of any startup can be divided into two parts — before product/market fit and after product-market fit…When you are before product-market fit, focus obsessively on getting to product-market fit.

	- Why? Because spending money too fast (especially in venture backed companies, which is almost exclusively the type of company Paul deals with) is a signal of poor thinking and poor decision making, which is pretty much impossible to overcome. If you are spending as little money as possible, it forces you to be resourceful and focus ONLY on the things that matter — which first and foremost is achieving product-market fit, and then selling.
