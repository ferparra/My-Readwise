	- our choices are typically appraised and selected against a background characterised by agential autonomy, informed understanding, and situational stability. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnve4t6bq5wf802p5kahn8f))
	- he person who contemplates undertaking the experience may be—and is likely to be—quite different to the person who subsequently undergoes it, or the person who emerges at the other side. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnvekqbsfc6ye6c62geywdc))
	- three deep features of human life are *contingency*, *vulnerability*, and *subjection.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnvfds70fkhgpvng3qn5d7r))
	- universal features of human life as such—they are *existentialia*, in Heidegger's sense of the term of essential features of *Dasein*, of creatures with our “manner of being” (Heidegger, [1996](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217260#ejop12480-bib-0019)).

	- We human beings are vulnerable to many kinds of affliction and most of us are at some time afflicted by serious ills. How we cope is only in small part up to us. It is most often to others that we owe our survival, let alone our flourishing, as we encounter bodily illness and injury, inadequate nutrition, mental defect and disturbance, and human aggression and neglect. *(MacIntyre, [1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217260#ejop12480-bib-0025), p. 1)* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnvpn65s9xgfe5djt1mkt2d))

	- Consider some potential major life events—serious accident, chronic illness, separation from a loved one, war, forced migration, poverty, famine, being the victim of a violent crime, suffering severe depression, and the variety of other traumatic experiences that may befall any of us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnvrdw4tjzg3c8jwvarjw1v))
	- We can never fully anticipate the outcome of our choices or dictate the neat unfolding of our future subsequent to a certain decision being made.[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217260#ejop12480-note-0001) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnvsm889p34f8ce4mfz9dwf))
	- Sophie, the eponymous protagonist of William Styron's ([1979](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217260#ejop12480-bib-0040)) novel, *Sophie's Choice*, is required by a Nazi doctor to choose which of her two children to send to the gas chambers, on pain of losing both. Sophie “chooses” to send her daughter to death (although her son is murdered later, too), a choice most parents would never feel able to make but which, in her panic, she blurts out and then carries with her for the remainder of her life.[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217260#ejop12480-note-0004) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnvtg0nkne778q62fypvkhx))

	- As Sartre points out, freedom without a capacity to reflect on it is insufficient, because this severs the relation of freedom to responsibility for the outcomes of one's decisions (Sartre, [1948](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217260#ejop12480-bib-0037)).

	- As Epictetus tells us in the opening sentence of the *Encheiridion*, “There are things which are within our power, and there are things which are beyond our power.”[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217260#ejop12480-note-0006) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnvxf9n41agkgs407xd9hhq))

	- *Positive epistemic transformation, positive personal* *transformation* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnvzbrbj0g6ck6mpwmrfs0f))
	- *Positive epistemic transformation, negative personal* *transformation* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnw4wm1qa1zvv675fn3cd80))
	- *Negative epistemic transformation, positive personal* *transformatio* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnw500y1mja9jjqmvn64p1f))
	- *Negative epistemic transformation, negative personal* *transformation* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnw6ev30qnez0gkp1rten2b))
	- We further suggest that epistemic transformation can consist of more than acquiring new knowledge. In other words, there is more to us, epistemically, than what we believe and what we know. The “more” can be our epistemic dispositions, virtues, stances, or psychologies: all of these can fundamentally change in ways we want to say are genuinely epistemically transformative.
