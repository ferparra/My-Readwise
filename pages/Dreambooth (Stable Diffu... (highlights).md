	- Dreambooth (stable diffusion finetuning for personal profile pictures) has been going viral last few days as well, for good reasons it's super fun; Unlike other places https://t.co/eIwkwiTY3o lets you play with infinite variations and experiment and play with your own prompts: https://t.co/w1SsH7UQ9R ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1600578169555529728))

	- Stableboost auto-suggests a few hundred prompts by default but you can generate additional variations for any one prompt that seems to be giving fun/interesting results, or adjust it in any way:

	- Stableboost works really well for pictures of couples and animals not just individuals. Eg hereâ€™s our family dog looking grand and cute :)

	- Itâ€™s really crazy to me that one can generate results this incredible and fun in just seconds, on demand, for any prompt you just think up on the spot. Upload ~20 images and try it out yourself https://t.co/eIwkwiBOPg ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1600583461613412352))
