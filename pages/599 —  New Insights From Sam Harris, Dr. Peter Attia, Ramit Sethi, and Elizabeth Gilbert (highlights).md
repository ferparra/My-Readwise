	  Sice, i used to love to ski, and i now haven't skied in well over a decade. Will i ever ski again? I 've no idea. But i can assure you that the last time i took off my skis, i was not even dimly aware of the possibility that it might be the last time, right, that i might live for many, many more years. And yet this stood a good chance of being the la time i would ever ski. When is the last time you swam in the ocean or went camping? One is the last time you took a walk just to take a walk? As you go about your day to day consider everything you're doing is like this. Everything represents a finite opportunity to savor your life. On some level, everything is precious. And if it doesn't seem that way, i think you'll find that paying more attention can make it seem that way. Attention really is your true source of wealth, even more than time, right? Because you can waste time being distracted. So this is just to urge you to take alittle more care when you meet someone for the first time and you shake their hand.

	- Is Reading Good For You?
	  
	  Summary:
	  Reading is one of the most important skills our species has ever acquired. Almost everything we care about depends on it. And to say that you should do this because it reduces stress, or confers any other anselary benefit is really to miss the point.

	  And to say that you should do this because it reduces stress, or confers any other anselary benefit is really to miss the point. Consider an analogy to reading. Is reading good for you? Does it reduce stress? Do you see what's peculiar about that framing? Given how profound the difference is between being an avid reader and being illiterate, these are strange questions. Just think about it. Does reading reduce stress? It sort of depends on what you read, right? Is it good for you? Well, i think we can all imagine scenarios where it's not good for somebody. Iany, kind of straightforward way. But reading is one of the most important skills our species has ever acquired. Almost everything we care about depends on it. Of course, mindfulness is a very different sort of skill, but it also has sweeping implications. And the other way to think about this is that you are always meditating on something. Your attention is always bound up in something. We largely become what we pay attention to. We are building our minds in each moment.

	- Is Dexa the Only Way to Do it?
	  
	  Summary:
	  Dexa is relatively inexpensive, a hundred dollars in most places. And the information it yields is also segmental, which is really valuable. So when we do adexa scan, we're looking at lots of information. We're looking at b m d, bone mineral density, total body fat and things like that. What i'm really interested in is what's your fat free mass index?

	  I think dex is the only way to do it, truthfully. I mean, obviously it's not the single most accurate way to do it. There are more accurate ways to do them, but those would all be done in a research setting. Dexa is relatively inexpensive, a hundred dollars in most places. Maybe if you're in a place like new york it's more. But we're talking of something in the low hundreds of dollars, not something that is thousands of dollars. And the information it yields is also segmental, which is really valuable. So unlike the sort of buoyancy based tests, which i think are quite inaccurate anyway, you don't get the segmental in ormation. You don't get the information of visceral atopost tissue. So when we do adexa scan, we're looking at lots of information. We're looking at b m d, bone mineral density, total body fat, things like that. But what i'm really interested in is, what's your fat free mass index? So that's the total lean tissue in kilograms divided by height in meters, squared the a l m i, which is the pendicular lean mass index, which is the same as the f f m i, except it's only using the lean mass of the four limbs, not including the torso or looking at vat and we're putting all these things on a nomogram to see where you rank for your age and sex.
