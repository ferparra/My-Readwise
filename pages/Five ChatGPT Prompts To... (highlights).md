		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1. Topic Sentences
	  
	  Many of us struggle with writing precise topic sentences for paragraphs.
	  
	  A topic sentence tells the reader what a particular paragraph is about. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1642404753060528130))
	- Take a paragraph and run it through ChatGPT with the prompt: “Please write a topic sentence for this paragraph.“
	  
	  Ask ChatGPT to give you three variations of the topic sentence. 
	  
	  Select the one you like. Rewrite it to suit your personal style.

	- 2. Transition Sentences
	  
	  Transition sentences make your writing coherent and cohesive.
	  
	  When a paragraph transitions smoothly to the next, it gives your writing a personality and keeps the reader glued.
	  
	  But writing good transition sentences is quite challenging. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1642405117633675267))
	- You can use ChatGPT to help you with it.
	  
	  Take two paragraphs you want to connect with a transition sentence.
	  
	  Run them through ChatGPT with the following prompt: “Please write a transition sentence to connect the two paragraphs.“

	- 3. Introduction
	  
	  Writing a good introduction to a journal article or a dissertation is challenging for both experienced and novice academic writers.
	  
	  You can ask ChatGPT to help you craft a great introduction. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1642405526444146688))
	- Write a draft of your introduction and run it through ChatGPT with the following prompt. “Please rewrite the following paragraph as an introduction."
	  
	  Rewrite the paragraph to suit your personal style.

	- 4. Conclusion
	  
	  Like an introduction, writing a conclusion that binds your whole article/chapter is also quite tricky.
	  
	  ChatGPT can help you with it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1642406022684856321))
	- Write a paragraph and run it through ChatGPT with the following prompt: “Please rewrite this paragraph as a conclusion."
	  
	  Ask for three variations. 
	  
	  Select the one you like best and rewrite it to suit your personal style.

	- 5. Counterargument
	  
	  Good writing is always nuanced. It incorporates opposing viewpoints and lets the reader be the judge.
	  
	  But when we work on developing an argument, we get so invested it becomes difficult for us to entertain any counterarguments. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1642406570821578752))
	- You can ask ChatGPT to give you counterarguments, which you can then add to your work.
	  
	  Take you argument and run it through ChatGPT with the following prompt, “Please give me a counterargument for this claim.”
