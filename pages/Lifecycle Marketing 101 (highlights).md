	- When starting from scratch, itâ€™s highly advisable to focus on the new user experience (i.e. the start of the user journey), since this is where the majority of users will drop off and churn. A campaign aimed at increasing conversion to in-app purchase may deliver monetary value, but the reach of such a campaign will be several orders of magnitude smaller than an onboarding campaign targeting new users.
