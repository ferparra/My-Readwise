	  So cauliflower is free. So even they're putting things into the smoothie. Yeah, I don't know if you can get a teenager to do that, but they often will use, like I have them do steam broccoli that's in the freezer because it's got very little taste. So that they could do that in a chocolate smoothie. They could add some greens. I like greens powders are super convenient. So that with, you know, kind of a taste that they like, whether that's chocolate, which is what most of my clients want, or, you know, vanilla with berries and that sort of thing. So that can go a long way if you don't like vegetables. And short of that, I would say some supplements, but I would say that's a distant second to making a smoothie. I've got one patient that I have to mention because he took this to the extreme. So he is a retired physicist professor at UCSD. He found out that his microbiome was a hot mess and developed autoimmune disease. And so he became hell bent like only a physicist could on changing this microbiome. And he dramatically shifted it by having a smoothie every day with 57 vegetables and fruits. 57 independent 57 independent. So, I mean, this just warms my heart the way that he did this, but he would go to the farmer's market. He would just get a bunch of this a bunch of that. And he would go home, make the smoothie and then stick it in the freezer so he'd have a serving every day. ([Time 0:28:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3294f2fb-2e36-4a10-857e-a512074a7eae))
