	- A story in 3 charts:
	  
	  (1) There is still a stupid amount of open futures interest in the system.
	  
	  (2)  Funding rates are at high levels.
	  
	  (3) Liquidation volume hasn't kicked off yet.
	  
	  Price is basically teetering on an edge because this industry sucks at learning lessons.
