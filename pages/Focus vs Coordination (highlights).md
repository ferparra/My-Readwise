	- Teams are like cloth-makers. Focus creates threads that coordination weaves into a cohesive whole. Seamless products are the result of perfect coordination.
	- Coordination failures disconnect us on a human level. Uncoordinated teammates suffer from either conflict or indifference; they either feel at war with their teammates, or like cogs in a useless machine.

	- Teams need both focus and coordination to thrive. Teams without focus are unproductive, while teams without coordination are counterproductive. A team without focus may be on the same page, but that page never turns.

	- Group size includes who we invite to meetings, who we send messages to, and who we choose to collaborate on ap roject.  When our teams arenâ€™t turning enough pages, we should limit group sizes in favor of more focused sessions. But when our teams are struggling to coordinate, we should encourage larger group sizes, so that people can figure out how to move gracefully together instead of in an uncoordinated chaos.
