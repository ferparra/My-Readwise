	- **Look-Then-Leap rule** states that you should set an amount of time you want to spend looking. This amount of time should then be split into a looking phase and a leaping phase. In the looking phase, you categorically don’t choose anyone. After that point, you enter the leaping phase and commit to the next candidate who outshines the best applicants from the looking phase. The looking phase shall occupy 37% of the time or the number of candidates you can afford to look at. This leads to a 37% chance of selecting the best (That it’s both 37% is a coincidence that results from the maths). 37% does not appear great, but is better or worse than the gut feeling?

	- The [Gittins Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gittins_index) models a strategy for deciding when to switch from one solution to another, based on the *history* of success rates. The way it works is that each alternative gets a score. For every decision, the alternative with the highest score is selected. Based on success or failure, the score is updated following a specific scheme. This strategy results in the following behavior: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnkjjzwjse682tsxfp8v43sk))
	- Following the advice of these algorithms, you should be excited to meet new people and try new things — to assume the best about them, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. In the long run, optimism is the best prevention for regret. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnkjnwmne2h7sg9h8v1a4zqc))
	- Explore when you will have time to use the resulting knowledge and exploit when you’re ready to cash in. The interval makes the strategy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnkjp3f0gcgkr59kr1heaxm2))
