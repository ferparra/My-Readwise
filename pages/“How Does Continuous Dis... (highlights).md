	- “How does continuous discovery come together for a new product?”
	  
	  How to think about continuous discovery in a nascent, early stage product—a 🧵... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481403702632071170))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Most product managers are working on existing products that already have found some level of traction. 
	  
	  Hopefully they're practicing well-established continuous discovery (CD) techniques such as those popularized by folks such as @ttorres and @cagan. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481403704284647425))
	- The first time you try, it can be confusing to translate these CD practices to a new product that doesn't exist or hasn't found traction yet. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481403705895182341))
	- I saw a question along these lines a few days ago, which I'll paraphrase as:
	  
	  > "Incremental continuous discovery makes total sense for established products. But how do you map the opportunity space and do continuous discovery for a new product that's still being conceptualized?" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481403707904299008))
	- I ran into this question last year when I coached a team to apply continuous discovery approaches for a totally new product. 
	  
	  The company's first product had done very well in the market. The CEO assigned a team to come up with the next product. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481403709544271873))
	- This was a "you need to come up with a product to grow revenue by at least $10M in the next 18 months" kind of setup. 
	  
	  (It's on track for that, btw.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481403711524012032))
	- So, how should we think about executing on a continuous discovery mindset if we're at the 0-1 stage of a product?
	  
	  What I find to be missing is an understanding of the context we're applying CD in.
	  
	  What's missing is an understanding of the *layers* we're operating across. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481403713298206724))

	- In any product, we're operating across three layers at once: 
	  1. The opportunity layer: the customer oppty/"problem space"
	  2. The experience layer: the shift in the user experience that the product seeks to deliver
	  3. The business layer: how the parts of the business fit together ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481403715105931266))
	- This is always true, but in a well-established company/product, it's less obvious. 
	  
	  In established products/companies, more of the map is "filled in" and we spend our time more in the opportunity layer. 
	  
	  It's useful to be explicit about all three at the earlier stages. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481403716984983552))
	- I tend to represent each layer as follows: 
	  
	  *The Opportunity layer*
	  
	  I like to represent this via an opportunity solution tree (OST), as described by @ttorres 👉 https://t.co/o6zGI5au72 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FI8Aaa9VEAIH1TU.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481403721070170113))
	- *The Experience layer* 
	  
	  I like to represent this via a user story map, as described by @jeffpatton 👉 https://t.co/9uNywDTY3X 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FI8AXZpVcAETu9u.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481403725809741824))
	- *The Business layer*
	  
	  I like to represent this via a lean canvas, as described by @ashmaurya 👉 https://t.co/Urvxlz5ZzG
	  
	  (At the VERY beginning, I use the leaner canvas by Ash, which zooms in on Customer + Problem / boxes 1&2 out of the whole canvas). 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FI8ArO0VgAItQUH.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481403730612264963))
	- There are many possible ways to represent the layers. 
	  
	  These are the methods I like best right now. 
	  
	  All three layers need to work individually and fit together cohesively. 
	  
	  Where to start? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481403732902379522))
	- **Start with the experience layer**. 
	  
	  The experience layer is what bridges the business layer with the opportunity layer. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FI8A6u5UUAYAZAO.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481404187195760641))
	- Ask: what is the new experience we want to create? At the business layer, a value prop summarizes that new/better experience and is the "bridge" between the customer and problem boxes on the lean canvas. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481404189276139521))
	- NOTE: this appears like a linear process. It's not. It's cyclical. 
	  
	  Practically, all layers are evolving in parallel and informing each other, and what changes is which "layers" have the bulk of your attention at a given stage of product/company. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481404190702243840))
	- Even more than a set of techniques, continuous discovery is a mindset, a way of approaching the work. 
	  
	  Whichever layers are your focus, approach the work in a "continuous discovery" way. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481404192182857728))
	- If you're at the early stages of "what are we building, who cares, and why?" then iterating around the leaner canvas + experience map (layers 2-3 from above) should be your focus. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481404193625628672))
	- You want to first understand:
	  • what's the A → B shift in the experience
	  • for whom
	  • how valuable that is to them (is it a painkiller, vitamin, or a dud?) + why
	  
	  ...which is a longer way of saying, "know your customer and value prop." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481404195148161024))
	- All of this learning will inform the OSTs that come later to go deep into the specific opportunities within the parts of the experience map that make the difference. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481404196716904450))
	- So, which tool when?
	  • Interviews / customer convos: always & forever.
	  
	  • Don't know customer + value prop? → Interviews + leaner canvas (biz level) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481406340085866496))
	- Which tool when? (cont.)
	  • Know customer, but not the change in their life? → Interviews + experience map / customer forces canvas 
	  
	  • Know value prop, but not how to deliver on it / improve value of solution? → Interviews + OST (opportunity level) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481406341683892226))
	- "But how do we know when we have enough to go on?" 
	  
	  I'll address this in a separate thread. 
	  
	  The short answer is, when you have enough confidence around how to shift the parts of the experience that will make the difference. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481406343193915397))
	- That's all for today. I am not the first or last to talk about this. Big thanks to the many people contributed to my thinking around this topic. 
	  
	  I hope this thread is useful to you in terms of organizing your thinking in those confusing early stages. 
	  
	  Good luck! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/askotzko/status/1481406344745811975))
