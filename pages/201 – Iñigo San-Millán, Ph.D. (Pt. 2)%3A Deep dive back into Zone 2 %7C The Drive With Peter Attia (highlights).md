document_note:: In this episode of The Drive With Peter Attia, Iñigo San-Millán, Ph.D., an applied physiologist, talks about the importance of zone 2 training and its connection to fat oxidation, carbohydrates, and lactate. He explains the nuances in muscle physiology, lactate, and fat oxidation, and the relationship between fitness level and lactate production. San-Millán also provides insight on how to identify your zone 2 level and an ideal training protocol that consists of four days of zone 2 training and one day of anaerobic/high-intensity effort. Finally, he shares his thoughts on supplements and the use of metformin.

	- **Functional threshold power (FTP), lactate measurements, and watts per kilo predict performance** – you really know where you stand before the race ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hnkp7dge1q37qjfd6pbej))
	- **Zone 2:** the exercise intensity at which you are stressing mitochondria and oxidative capacity the most ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hp0tz3ta72hb4raeennts))
	- **Tenants of zone 2 training:** recruits mainly type I muscle fibers, mobilizes the highest amount of fat oxidation, and stimulates bioenergetics (fat & glucose in mitochondria) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hnwdeyvh68qre5hd6jj5f))
	- The purest way to estimate zone 2 training is indirect telemetry which will give us information about fat oxidation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hp91m2j2z95vcwbs3hbpm))
	- Ratio of VO2 and VCO2 tells us how much energy comes from fat oxidation and how much is glycolytic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hpjrkktt6b6x1tm8bjrpx))
	- Mitochondria oxidize fuels differently at different exercise intensities – an elite athlete can still recruit slow-twitch muscle fibers at high intensities and rely on fat to produce energy while the average person fully relies on glucose (instead of fat) to sustain the effort ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hpnmcdpmwh7r3yz9z9kjm))
	- The independent variable is workload (in watts); the dependent variable is blood lactate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hpyjf1qb6gmp2d05kdxcs))
	- Once lactate exceeds 2 mmol you are leaving zone 2 and entering zone 3 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hpw79f02kmn0axcktwm9s))
	- **The lactate in the blood reflects mitochondrial oxidation:** someone with high power output who needs a lot of glycolysis to produce energy will produce lactate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hqab69x0xc16xgm9e8zf1))
	- Every time you use glucose you produce pyruvate; every time that pyruvate will be reduced to lactate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hqfn8hd3sj1zst60z09kq))
	- **A reasonable measure of how zone 2 should feel:** you can carry out a full conversation, maybe not as comfortably as if you weren’t exercising, but still without much strain ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hqrxhdvcca8nt0htkg4a4))
	- You want to know your actual maximum heart rate – zone 2 will be about 70-80% of your realized maximum heart rate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hqwvywfatmc02799re3av))
	- Heart rate variability is actually a strong indicator of how hard you should push or backoff exercise ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hr4w94cp8jr3806z43nvp))
	- **Rest & recovery is key!** When you’re overworked, adjust the parameters of what “success” means in your training that day ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hra6fxr7ebd8pycjt5qay))
	- **“You can accomplish very important mitochondrial adaptations and very important metabolic adaptations by exercising one hour…3-4 days per week.”** ***– Iñigo San-Millán*** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hrf3225bnh3rcmje5ehva))
	- **Ideal parameters of zone 2:** ideally train 1 hour-1.5 hours, 4x per week ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hrnkf9hj5y517ne3evc17))
	- **Four pillars of fitness:** (1) stability; (2) strength; (3) “low-end aerobic” or zone 2; (4) high intensity/anaerobic capacity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hrt2ndpmbwrmkw768sg4q))
	- VO2 max is highly correlated with longevity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hrwxdmvmxqmsr7jd4rx3v))
	- High intensity is critical for sustaining glycolytic capacity, especially as we age – but thankfully it can be improved in just a few months ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hs072kj7n3rn3mm0st9nc))
	- **Ways to incorporate high-intensity training:** (1) add a 5th day of exercise dedicated to high intensity (in addition to your four zone 2 days); (2) once per week add high-intensity bout after 60-90 minute zone 2 workout ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4hs334b354y30ww01b69k1))
	- It’s plausible that muscles eat themselves to feed themselves and the rest of the body – so getting some sort of load-bearing training (even moving extremities in bed) and supplementing with amino acids could improve outcomes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4ht1svvbfdym8g547y8dwk))
		- **Note**: Iñigo San-Millán returns to The Drive to discuss the importance of zone 2 training, which is the exercise intensity at which mitochondria and oxidative capacity are most stressed. He explains how lactate is produced as a byproduct of glycolysis, and how it is oxidized in the mitochondria back to energy. He discusses the nuances of muscle physiology, lactate, and fat oxidation, and suggests that a reasonable measure for understanding zone 2 is when one can still carry out a full conversation without much strain. He recommends four days of zone 2 training lasting 60-90 minutes, as well as one day of anaerobic/high-intensity effort. He also cautions against taking NAD supplements as they have been linked to tumor growth in cancerous mice.
