	- Apple’s Decision-Making Framework To Build Revolutionary Products
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* It is important to be clear about the reasons for decisions made when developing a new product or service, so that everyone involved feels part of the decisionmaking process., * When developing a new product or service, it is important to be aware of the tradeoffs involved in different options, and to communicate these to the team.)

	  Speaker 1
	  I know it was really that attention to detail, and he, when he would make a decision, you know, there are, when you make the first version of anything, something revolutionary, there are a lot of opinion-based decisions. And there's only one or two people, three people who hold those opinion-based decisions and what they should be. And when you have those opinions and you're trying to work with the team to implement those decisions. You have to really tell the why of those decisions. Just don't go do it, but why it's there. So you can feel part of that decision. You can understand what were the trade-offs of the different other answers to that opinion, right? And say, this is the reason why we picked the what we picked, because it's this for the customer or this for the whole world story, what have you. So that you felt really good, because a lot of times most people want a data-driven decision. But with V1s, you don't get data. Right maybe in a B2B you could a little bit, because you can talk to customers, but you can't do that with a consumer property.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  V1, version 1, B2B, business to business versus what's the alternative?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Business to consumer V1. Okay.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  We're just defining some terms. Yes, you're absolutely. So, and when you say data-driven decisions versus what?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Opinion-based decisions.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So like gut, you have to use, you don't have any.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  You can't fall back on any data or any previous history to kind of inform you of what's going on, right? And so if you look at most companies who are paralyzed and cannot make new innovations and new products, it's because they're trying to turn, and this is what I saw at Philips, they're trying to turn opinion-based decisions into data-driven decisions so they don't lose their jobs. So if you look at management consulting, management consulting is all about taking those opinion-based decisions, giving them to someone else to turn into data that comes back to them and says, they can blame the management consultants when something goes wrong, as opposed to it wasn't me. Yeah. Right? You need to have to tell that story, you have to understand that especially V1, you need to be able to articulate those opinion-based decisions and you need to own them. And if you fail with some of them, you didn't get it right, you then own them and fix them and move on, right? Version one of the iPod wasn't perfect. Version one of the iPhone wasn't perfect. We got a lot of opinion-based decisions wrong. But as you go through it because you got more data, because V2, you had data on those original opinions and then you were able to then modulate off of that, right? And you still have new opinions because those are differentiators that we call differentiators, the things that move the product forward in its evolution. But at the revolution stage, opinions, opinions, opinions, no data.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So you have this discussion, you and Steve in the stage and the whole team with opinions. And there you have to be harsh.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I wouldn't say harsh, but you have to be very determined, right? There are two real opinion-based decisions that happen on the iPhone. One was the keyboard. Should we have a hard-board keyboard or should we have a virtual keyboard? The BlackBerry was the number one productivity messaging device of its time. It was called a crackberry for a reason because people loved it because it was easy to type and they could get their work done. But when you're saying we're going to move from that, everyone's talking about that in the market and you say we're going to move to a virtual keyboard and it's not going to work as well as the hardware keyboard, that's an opinion-based decision, right? Because the data is telling you all the best sales are over here. God, that takes cuts. It takes cuts. But you have to look at it from a different point of view. And this is how I learned to come to understand this because I had been building virtual keyboards before and I knew the goodness and the badness in them, right? But he was like, look, those are productivity devices. We're making it where ours is born out of it in an entertainment device and productivity, right? We need to show full-screen videos. We're not apps, but are apps, the Apple apps because there were no app store yet, are going to take over the whole screen. You want a full-screen web browser. You don't want one that's like half of the device is just a keyboard. Maybe you don't need that keyboard in every instance. So we want that part of the screen to change based on the tool you may need at the time. And maybe it's just full view, right? So you have to go and understand it's a different type of device just because that's that and it's successful for that reason, the crackberry for the keyboard. That's not the only thing you're going to do with this device because people only did messaging and maybe a few phone calls, right? This was going to be so much more. It was going to be an entertainment web browsing device. So you wanted those tools to go away, but it wouldn't be as good as the hardware keyboard. So that's an opinion. Let me give you another opinion based decision that got turned around before it shipped. Steve said, no sim slot. I don't want any slots. We're going to make it very pure. Johnny was like, of course, no slots. Johnny I. And we all looked around and go, that doesn't work. You can't do that. Well, why does Verizon, and then he would always, and this was the magic of Steve, like when you said, no, that doesn't work, you go, well, why does Verizon not have any sim slots, right? They showed that you can do a mobile phone with those lids on you're like, okay, here we go. And so a few days later, we come back with, you know, and so product marketing voice to the customer engineering, we all come back with all the data showing how many, how many data networks and mobile networks required SIM cards versus did not, and what the trends were. And so we showed the data and that killed the, excuse me, brought back the sim slot on that original iPhone because we're like, he, because he was just like, we're going to tell AT&T to not use a sim. Yeah. Right. We're going to just tell them to do it differently. Right. But we were like, if we want this thing to go anywhere around the world, you want to put that friction in. People who are going to move from place to place, you know, they have different sims because of the prices and all that stuff. We had to show all of that data. And then that opinion based decision got turned into a data driven decision. And it, and the sim slot obviously showed up. So those are two very, at the very same time, right? Opinion can hold and so can data over rule opinion when data does exist for a V one.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  But the, at the end of the day, you don't know what the right answer is. So doing no sim car slot may have ([Time 1:26:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/44b35386-acf8-46cc-af5a-6886efb13f5d))
