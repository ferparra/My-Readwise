document_note:: Albert Ellis, the founder of Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT), identified eleven common rigid, irrational beliefs which can lead to neurosis. These beliefs include that a person must be loved or approved by everyone, they must be competent, people who do wrong must be blamed and punished, and that there is always a perfect solution to problems. Ellis's list is a reflection of his clinical wisdom and suggests that rational alternatives and Stoic philosophy can help improve these beliefs.
