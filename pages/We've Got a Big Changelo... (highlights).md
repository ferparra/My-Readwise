	- Linear Preview:🔍New filters
	  
	  We redesigned issue filters to allow new filtering capabilities including OR and NOT operators, date ranges, and much more. Apply filters on the fly or use them to create Views. https://t.co/OOK80kf2bw ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/linear/status/1458150060823392262))
	- Linear Preview: 📄 Project documents
	  
	  Adding longer documents to projects has been our most requested feature since we released Roadmap.
