	- The bond market is talking. Very loudly.
	  
	  Let me try to translate for you what it's saying.
	  
	  A ''wtf is going on in fixed-income'' thread.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- Central Bankers are freaking out about inflation, and they want to be seen as reacting strongly
	  
	  As a former bond investor, all you hear is ''green light to push short-term rates toðŸŒ™and test them''
	  
	  And indeed: Fed Funds futures now price in more than 5 hikes in 2022

	- Investors often think in probability terms
	  
	  While the mean outcome sits at around 5.3 hikes, the hawkish right tail is getting increasingly fatter
	  
	  Markets are pricing >17% chance the Fed will hike 7+ times (!) in 2022 vs 3% prob. of 0-3 hikes
	  
	  @MetreSteven any thoughts?

	- Alright, but what's the bond market saying about the medium term then?
	  
	  Fed Funds are priced to peak in early 2024 at around 1.90%, and the Fed is priced to lean towards RATE CUTS after that - basically, forward rates are inverted already few years down the road!

	- Fixed income investors are pricing a very fast & short hiking cycle: 7 hikes in 2 years and done - with chances the Fed will have to cut soon after.
	  
	  This is also reflected in an inverted inflation breakeven curve: 3% inflation for a couple of years, and back to 2% after.

	- Also, long-term (5y forward, 5y) inflation expectations have gone nowhere over the last 12 months: trading in a range between 2.1% and 2.4% based on PCE inflation.
	  
	  So much for a regime change.
	  
	  The bond market thinks inflationary pressures are real, but not here to stay.

	- If inflation expectations trade sideways but nominal yields move, real rates go up fast.
	  
	  5y US real yields moved up 65 bps in 1 month - that's really quick.
	  
	  Financial conditions for the private sector are tightening, and now credit spreads have started to widen too.

	- The borrowing costs for the private sector are:
	  
	  Real Yields + Credit Spreads
	  
	  When both go up, refinancing debt & accessing new credit becomes prohibitive if real wages haven't gone up
	  
	  And they have actually gone...down
	  
	  @LynAldenContact, what's your take here?

	- Even EU is in the same boat now, after Lagarde turned very hawkish yesterday
	  
	  The 5y-30y EU curve is flattening quick as the ECB signals hikes while structural headwinds limit the upside for long-term growth & inflationary pressures.
	  
	  @AndreasSteno: are they gonna hike?

	- A very hawkish stance while the growth impulse decelerates = flatter curves
	  
	  The risk of inversion (!) is real - but pay attention to which curve you use
	  
	  I cover this & more in my primer on yield curve inversions published this week
