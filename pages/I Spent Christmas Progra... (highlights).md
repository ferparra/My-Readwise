	- I spent Christmas programming with ChatGPT. 
	  
	  Some observations: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1609931358213935105))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- It’s incredibly good at helping you get started in a new project. It takes all of the research and thinking and looking things up and eliminates it…
	  
	  In 5 minutes you can have the stub of something working that previously would’ve taken a few hours to get up and running. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1609931360117948418))
	- Even more impressive is that it can even do UI—if you ask it for a React app that looks a certain way it’ll build it for you, and it works pretty well! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1609931361791401985))
	- I’d say it probably doubles my output as a programmer, and simultaneously increases my code quality. 
	  
	  I feel way smarter using it. https://t.co/9mtJsSfnqb ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1609931362894479362))
	- It also changes what it means to be a programmer. 
	  
	  I spend a lot of time now thinking about how to write prompts—where previously I might’ve been Googling a problem or trying to write a function from scratch. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1609931365318856711))
	- It’s very clear that this changes programming forever, and gets us way closer to the dream of being able to tell a computer what to do in natural language. 
	  
	  But it’s still limited in certain important areas. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1609931366849814529))
	- For one, I wouldn’t be able to do any of this if I didn’t know how to code. Right now it enables me to do stuff I already know how to do, much faster. 
	  
	  But there’s a lot of built up expertise that goes into knowing what to ask it to do, and understanding its output. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1609931368296742913))
	- For another, it sometimes gets stuck on subtler issues. 
	  
	  For example, I was building a Flask app with database migrations and running into a cryptic error. 
	  
	  ChatGPT led me in the wrong direction because it was giving me instructions for a previous version of Flask. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1609931370079338497))
	- I had to Google around for a while but I finally found an answer. So things like versioning, or uncommon corner case errors are a little harder for it to handle. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1609931371686031360))
	- It also just gets unwieldy when the code base starts to get bigger. 
	  
	  CoPilot helps with this to some degree, but I’ve mostly found that to be useful for producing small snippets of code. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1609931373267279872))
	- I think it will take a while for the implications of all of this to be digested by the broader ecosystem. 
	  
	  I think there are a lot of companies that specifically don’t allow engineers to use tools like this for fear of copyright and security issues. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1609932464343883776))
	- Companies that can use these tools will go a lot faster, with far fewer engineers than before.  
	  
	  And individuals working on side projects will have a ton more leverage to get more done with fewer resources than ever before. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1609932466382405632))
	- This is a technology-driven change that’s the closest thing to magic I’ve ever seen.
	  
	  The next couple of years are going to be wild. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1609932761531404295))
