	- What does your tech stack for learning look like?
	  
	  Mine:
	  â€¢ Kindle for books
	  â€¢ Memex / Instapaper for articles
	  â€¢ @readwiseio to sync everything
	  â€¢ @RoamResearch as a second brain to feed my first brain
	  â€¢ Roam SR for spaced repetition (bye bye Anki, after 15+ years) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1379755406558367749))
	- Keep a journal to raise your awareness and change habits.
	  
	  Because habits are automatic behaviors, itâ€™s nearly impossible to stop them in each moment.
	  
	  A journal can make you aware of what triggers a habit, enabling you to take away its spark.
	  
	  ðŸ”‘ The key: be specific.

	  Not just useful for recipes. Documenting your workflows means less memorization and easy outsourcing. https://t.co/I7ifinfW2M ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1459309792321851392))
