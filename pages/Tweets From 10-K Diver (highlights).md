	- Induction is a super useful technique to prove theorems in math.
	  
	  It‚Äôs based on this simple idea:
	  
	  IF you can get on the lowest rung of a ladder,
	  
	  and IF, from any rung, you know how to get to the next rung,
	  
	  THEN you can ascend the ladder as high as you like.
	  
	  An example:

	- Here's how great businesses work:
	  
	  1. Invest Capital. Turn "cash" into "things".
	  
	  2. Earn A Return. Turn those "things" back into MORE cash.
	  
	  3. Give *Surplus* Cash Back To Owners, and
	  
	  4. Re-invest. Repeat from #1, but with more cash than before.

	- What people *think* investing is:
	  
	  Forecast what will happen. Bet on it. Make money if it happens. Lose money otherwise.
	  
	  What investing *really* is:
	  
	  FACE the uncertainty around forecasts. Place bets that make money with high probability ‚Äî *no matter what happens*.

	- Many financial calculations use the concept of Expected Value.
	  
	  Expected Value is the AVERAGE of all possible paths we could take.
	  
	  But that‚Äôs not how REAL LIFE works.
	  
	  In REAL LIFE, we get to take ONE path, NOT some hypothetical ‚Äúaverage‚Äù.
	  
	  So, that‚Äôs what we should prepare for.
