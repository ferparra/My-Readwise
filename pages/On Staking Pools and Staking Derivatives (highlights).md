	- PoS allows users to stake their ETH and operate block-producing nodes called validators.
	- In return for providing security to this system, stakers are rewarded with new ETH from inflation
	- Beacon Chain and Ethereum as we know it will merge, allowing stakers to also earn the transaction fees and Miner-Extractable Value (MEV) that currently go to PoW miners.
	- to incentivize decentralization, but we posit that the market will always step in to make staking more efficient and convenient
	- From the user’s perspective, things are very straightforward: They deposit ETH into an Ethereum smart contract, and receive stETH as a receipt. The stETH token’s balance adjusts over time to reflect the distribution of staking rewards that accrue to the contract. That means, 1 stETH will always represent 1 ETH staked.
