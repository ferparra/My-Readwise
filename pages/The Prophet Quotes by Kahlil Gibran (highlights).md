	- “You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts.”
	    ―
	  
	    Kahlil Gibran,
	  
	    
	      The Prophet
	- “Let there be spaces in your togetherness, And let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together, yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.”

	    Khalil Gibran,
	  
	    
	      The Prophet
	- “Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself”
	    ―
	  
	    Khalil Gibran,
	  
	    
	      The Prophet
	- “The timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness. And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.”
	    ―
	  
	    Khalil Gibran,
	  
	    
	      The Prophet
	- “And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair”

	    Khalil Gibran,
	  
	    
	      The Prophet
