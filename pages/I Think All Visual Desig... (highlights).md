	- I think all visual design skill is made up of six things. Here they are, and how you might improve them.
	  
	  1) Patterns: If you look at lots of design you will naturally learn the common visual design patterns that are effective. Exposure to as much design as possible is key. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hobdaydesign/status/1594684248274903046))

	- 2) Rules: Good visual design is driven by rules (e.g. related things should be aligned). You can learn what these rules are through exposure to good design (you pick them up naturally), or learning them from other designers who write them down/speak about them.

	- 3) Skilful techniques: some visual design techniques are not easy to recreate at first glance. You need to learn a skill to be able to carry them out. Drawing your own illustrations, for example, is much harder to do that creating a drop-shadow.
	  
	  Practice these if you want. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hobdaydesign/status/1594684251890409473))
	- 4) Pay close attention: You should make a habit of this so that you do it without thinking. Every time you see good visual design, you should stop to admire it. To zoom in and look closely. To start to pull it apart to understand something that feels new to you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hobdaydesign/status/1594684253643722754))
	- 5) Collect inspirational design: For when your mental knowledge of patterns fails you, you should have a collection of design to look at. It does not necessarily need to be good design, but it needs to help you find pattern ideas. Get into the habit of saving things you like.

	- 6) Endless iteration: There's a chance this is the one foundation you cannot improve, or force. Good design needs iteration, and it needs far more iteration than most people assume. Sometimes you can rely on other people (e.g. a manager) to give you the energy to iterate. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hobdaydesign/status/1594684257015930880))
