document_note:: Brad Schoenfeld, Ph.D. discusses the importance of resistance training for improving strength, muscle development, bone density, and muscle hypertrophy. Protein intake is essential for muscle synthesis and maintenance, and should be 1.6-1.8g/kg body weight per day for resistance training individuals, and 0.8g/kg body weight per day for sedentary individuals. Combining different concepts and types of training is beneficial, and the last few reps need to be hard to experience gains. For maximum hypertrophy, 10-20 sets per muscle per week are recommended, and a minimum of 4 sets per muscle per week is needed for muscle gains. Recovery is important, and the body should be given 48 hours to recover before training again. Lastly, resistance training is an important supplement for reducing calories to lose weight.

	- Resistance training is an important supplement for reducing calories to lose weight *–* if you do not lift weights, you will lose muscle as you lose body fat ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy2ajt45en2djsqqt77r4t))
	- Adequate protein intake is essential for muscle synthesis and maintenance
	  
	  •   Shoot for 1.6-1.8g/kg body weight if resistance training and a minimum 0.8g/kg body weight if sedentary ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy1vxf20hve5cty0wfh1s5))
	- When considering rest periods between sets, the ability to perform volume load is more important than optimizing hormones through rest length ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy1s1yt2dgep9tbch347nf))
	- Dosing resistance training:
	  
	  •   To maximize hypertrophy: 10-20 sets per muscle, per week
	  •   Minimum effective dose to gain muscle: 4 sets per muscle, per week ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy2ge5jt8f5mkqseek1gcr))
	- Aerobic exercise will improve the cardiovascular system but will do little to improve strength, muscle development, and muscle hypertrophy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy2yyg32bnn7zqadg8resb))
	- It might actually be beneficial to spread out protein intake across 3-4 meals ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy3sqm0mdfw71avr1w4j9j))
	- **Caveat to lifting light loads:** intensity matters! The last few reps still need to be difficult to complete, you must challenge your muscles ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy44jjpwremqdhssyev5pw))
	- **Volume is a driver of hypertrophy** – but it is individual, some people respond better to low volume while others respond to higher volume ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy49sbgp3rb908mv20hfxa))
	- **General dose to maximize hypertrophy:** 10-20 sets per muscle, per week ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy4r8sqydwqy0v6287m6dq))
	- **Minimum effective dose to gain muscle:** 4 sets per muscle, per week ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy4sne6mva6ewk7xbgp7wv))
	- Muscle protein synthetic response takes about 48 hours ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy5nx5dmnqke27j7x1p4qw))
	- **Soreness** is generally due to novel stimuli, generally from the eccentric lengthening of muscles under tension ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy5wn6as3ktr6452fqbreh))
	- **You do not need to be sore to make gains**; soreness may be the sign you’re challenging muscles beyond the present state but it isn’t a requirement ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy5znf4rtg6j2xb49bxthq))
	- Heavy loads are still better for strength but blood flow restriction training is a good option to reduce time and joint stress ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy6byj62mk5abdkmj73mqd))
	- Brad Schoenfeld’s Routine ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy6hr81fpdxj1zh53wgyyr))
	- 4x per week resistance training, alternating 2 days on + 1 day off ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy6jx2j9edaxhft8q1ghh2))
	- Upper/lower split workouts lasting 45-60 minutes of hard effort, all sets within 1-2 reps of failure ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy6knj5h3zvzg6a7mm5eb7))
	- 12,000 steps per day walking ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwy6mj5mfj9deah6hqbq8ps))
