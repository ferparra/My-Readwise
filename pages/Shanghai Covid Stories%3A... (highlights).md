	- Shanghai Covid Stories: 
	  
	  So how do you get food during a lockdown, when shops, restaurants and delivery apps are out of service?
	  
	  Spoiler: It's tough.
	  
	  A thread.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- On the evening of the announcement of the lockdown half of Shanghai seemed to be descending onto supermarkets at once.
	  
	  People bought everything. They over-prepared, taking what they could carry.
	  
	  It didn't matter.

	- Your first thought might be delivery apps. Good idea! Restaurants, supermarkets, shops: they're all on there.
	  
	  But now instead of 100 shops nearby only one might pop up at 6am. You try to order, tapping time and again, but they disappear before you can finish or the App crashes.

	- Stories begin to circulate. Roughly 11,000 delivery drivers are supposed to be camping outside, some in tents, some under bridges. They are trying to avoid being locked down in their homes so they can keep delivering goods.
	  
	  Hope!

	- But then you realize that's just one driver for every 2,300 residents.

	- City districts are trying to organize food deliveries. But how many of us have ever tried to organize food for tens or even hundreds of thousands?
	  
	  Maybe you are lucky and food arrives on a gigantic truck. Maybe you are not. We all hear there are people starving.
	  
	  I am lucky. https://t.co/CFPewY1JTd ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chris__pc/status/1518543763638956032))
	- Maybe you decide to volunteer.
	  This is what you will do, besides handing out antigen tests and collecting the trash for all your neighbors, who aren't allowed to come out of their apartments. https://t.co/sf6MgPg7XK ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chris__pc/status/1518544140073521153))
	- Here is what we got in one of these boxes.
	  
	  We have gotten four in just as many weeks.
	  We think we are among the luckier ones. https://t.co/XuUW3upAJ7 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chris__pc/status/1518544552688119808))
	- People in high-rise apartment buildings often don't know their neighbors. Now they begin organizing building-wide group chats.
	  
	  Someone knows a bakery and they still have staff sleeping in the warehouse. Who wants a bread box? Minimum order RMB6,000. Together we can do that.

	- Each box contains Pretzels, 100 slices of toasted bread, 2 loafs of sourdough bread and 12 sesame rolls. High quality stuff. RMB 250/box. 
	  
	  50 orders come together quickly. If you were the one organizing this you now have to collect money from everyone, transfer it and wait.

	- It takes about three days for a truck to pull up outside. Each order is in its own box but its at the front gate. 
	  Some come at 4am, some come hours late.
	  
	  You have to put on a hazmat suit and deliver them to everyone yourself.

	- Someone sources eggs. Another group chat pops up with a fresh milk offer. Bottled water is sourced. You are lucky, you live in a large residential compound with many people around.
	  
	  Others are not. Buildings with active infections get doors sealed shut, no deliveries in and out.

	- You hear stories of old people who cannot use smartphones. One grandpa lives three floors below you. 
	  
	  Food is being organized for them and people in the group chat ask for insulin. He has run out. 
	  
	  He is lucky. Others are not.

	- After a week the public food deliveries get sorted out. You get good quality supplies but they are not nearly enough. This won't change. You are on your own to fill the gap.
	  
	  Neighbors volunteer to collect and distribute the group buys. Only a few individual purchases make it. https://t.co/VwL4KeWBs2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chris__pc/status/1518549184126676992))
	- You may now have enough staple foods but all the creature comforts you are used to are gone. That sauce you like? That one ingredient you need to make that one dish? Alcohol? 
	  
	  All that is not happening.

	- Remember: not everyone can even afford the price increases that happen when supply shortages create bottlenecks.
	  
	  I dare also not think of what people in quarantine facilities are fed. This widely-shared image shows an office building that was converted into one such place.

	- Meanwhile your release date from quarantine gets pushed back time and again. Every single time your entire residential compound has a single case the 14-day clock restarts. 
	  
	  Now you no longer feel that lucky. You see a few others being released. Some get locked again soon after.

	- Micro-entrepreneurs have sprung up, selling what they have on the street. Very few shops are open. You don't have much choice even if they let you out onto the streets.
	  
	  @TMK_TinaManiK shared a few such images. Do follow her.

	- If you want to understand just how empty Shanghai is take a look at this drone footage by @timmy_tumbler on Youtube. His Channel is very much worth subscribing to.

	- Need medical treatment? Many hospitals aren't accepting new patients. 
	  
	  The neighborhood committee sources a pass for the old man in your building to be driven to his doctor. He walks back four hours because he is ashamed of calling for help. No taxis.
	  
	  I see others walking home. https://t.co/uTvhOoAe7O ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chris__pc/status/1518552939152830464))
	- While you are going through all this your savings continue to dwindle. Shanghai is an expensive city and there is no reprieve from rent or other bills. 
	  
	  If you are living paycheck-to-paycheck one box like this might be it for a week.

	- I am working on a documentary about the many delivery drivers who are keeping us fed now. Often the poorest of the poor, they are accepting the risks and hardships so they can help us survive - and get by themselves.
	  
	  If you are a broadcaster or editor - DMs are open.

	- One final comment: I get a lot of shocked replies to these lockdown threads and you are right to recognize these are very hard times and that it is ok to not be ok. 
	  
	  But in normal times this is a fascinating, beautiful and certainly never boring city. I am happy to call SH home. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chris__pc/status/1518555359090135040))
