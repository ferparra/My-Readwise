	- Confirmed.
	  
	  India has just bought oil from Russia-- at a discount (!) AND in rupees-roubles.
	  
	  This is the real story that you won't hear on the news. 
	  
	  Global realignment. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/richimedhurst/status/1504910341624545281))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- We are talking about India, a nuclear power with a population of 1.3 billion, and the world's 3rd largest importer of oil. The quantity here is irrelevant.
	  
	  India, like Pakistan, China, and others, is signaling it is not against Russia.
	  
	  The West =/= the international community. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/richimedhurst/status/1504910617949442060))
	- So far:
	  
	  -Biden begging Maduro for oil
	  -The US wants nuclear deal back, UK pays debt, just to get Iranian oil on the market
	  -Saudis considering selling oil to China in Yuan, not USD
	  -India buying Russian oil in rupees. Pakistan and EU buy as usual
	  
	  Not looking great for the US ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/richimedhurst/status/1504939036988911633))
