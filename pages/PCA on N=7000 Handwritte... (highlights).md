	- I love PCA because you cannot tell it what to find
	  
	  In the movie, the bottom turns from convex to concave and then eventually loops around. meanwhile, the top lies down and relaxes onto its back
	  
	  the way it relaxes, it looks alive. its how I feel when finals are over ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/karlrohe/status/1479619336746807299))
	- It is the first PC of n=7000 mnist images,
	  each with d = 784 = 28^2 pixels
	  
	  Each frame gives the average of multiple 784-vectors, plotted as an image
	  
	  The right panel gives the distribution of X-hat's and shows which images are averaged
