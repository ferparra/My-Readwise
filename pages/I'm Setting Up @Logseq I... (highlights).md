	- I'm setting up [[@logseq]] in combination with @obsdmd as a (potential) alternative to Roam.
	  
	  Why? Because I want to explore more of the Tools for Thought space‚Äîand have a space to journal where there are 100% no prying eyes.
	  
	  üßµ Read on and also learn how to set this up. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1443546446360313859))

	- Why would I use two apps to replace one powerful thinking tool?
	  
	  First off, I'm not replacing @RoamResearch as I do most of my knowledge work in it. My current workflows hardly translate to other tools.
	  
	  But, I need a private space to journal and love to write in blocks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1443546447513718785))
	- How to get started combining [[@logseq]] and @obsdmd.
	  
	  The first step is obviously to install both Logseq and Obsidian.
	  
	  Grab [[Obsidian]] from their website: https://t.co/3WjoHfOjBJ
	  
	  For Logseq you'll want to get the desktop app to make this system work: https://t.co/h01DgtO9yg ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1443546448675573760))
	- First install @logseq in a folder that's easy to find and sync.
	  
	  In the Logseq folder there will be several other folders created: logseq, journals, and pages. The latter two are important for Obsidian.
	  
	  I've created my Logseq graph in my iCloud drive for easy syncing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1443546449967341578))
	- Next, install @obsdmd.
	  
	  Upon starting the app for the first time, click "Open folder as vault" and select the folder you've just created for your Logseq graph.
	  
	  The journals, logseq, and pages folders should now be visible in the file explorer on the left.

	- Before you can start using @logseq and access all of your files in @obsdmd (and vice versa), some Obsidian settings need to be adjusted.
	  
	  Hat tip to "Luhmann" on the Logseq forums for these instructions.

	- From Obsidian's settings:
	  
	  1) Go to the Files & Links tab.
	  2) Set default location for new notes to "In the folder specified below"
	  3) Enter pages
	  4) Set the new link format to "Relative path to file"
	  5) Turn [[Wikilinks]] OFF to use Markdown links instead (better compatibility)

	- To properly manage attachments across @logseq and @obsdmd, make sure you have the following set in the same Files & Links tab:
	  
	  1) Set the default location for new attachments to "In the folder specified below"
	  2) Enter assets
	  
	  Obsidian will create the assets folder for you.

	- Now, let's make @obsdmd play nicely with @logseq's Daily Notes Page.
	  
	  First, from Obsidian's settings, enable the Daily Notes plugin from the Core Plugins tab. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAiB3c7VcAYZQtE.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1443546472075579396))
	- Next, you'll want to make sure @logseq and @obsdmd handle the Daily Notes page the same.
	  
	  To do this:
	  1) Scroll down to the Daily Notes plugin options.
	  2) Set date format to YYYY_MM_DD
	  3) The the new file location to: journals

	- The reason I use @logseq is because I like to write in a block-based outliner. @obsdmd is different in that it's a page-based tool.
	  
	  Search the community plugins tab in Obsidian for "Outliner" and "Zoom" to get a Roam-like outlining experience. It's the üçí on top. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1443546478090145792))
	- Finally, close Obsidian and open Logseq to make sure the links to the Daily Notes Page are compatible with Obsidian.
	  
	  Go to the Settings.
	  
	  From the Editor tab, make sure the preferred date format is set to: yyyy_MM_dd.
	  
	  Now any date link you create in Logseq works in Obsidian.
