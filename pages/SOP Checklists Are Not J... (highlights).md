	- SOP checklists are not just for teams.
	  
	  One of the best things you can do for your future self is to write down process checklists for regular tasks you do.
	  
	  And It doesn't have to be complicated. Here's my simple guide to personal SOP checklists ðŸ‘‡

	- SOP's don't have to be scary or complicated. As you're completing a regular or recurring task:
	  
	  ðŸ‘‰ Write down each of the steps as you do them
	  ðŸ‘‰ Add links to docs or websites you need (so you can get back there in one click
	  ðŸ‘‰ Include screenshots or looms for easy reference ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1590808608702631937))
	- These checklists will save you so much more than just time.
	  
	  ðŸ‘‰ They'll stop you from procrastinating on tasks (because the steps are in front of you)
	  ðŸ‘‰ They'll reduce cognitive load so you can get more creative work done ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1590808610371932160))
	- Your future self will thank you (like mine did yesterday) when you pull up to a task and it already has the steps laid out for you.
	  
	  5 minutes later and BOOM ðŸ’¥ you're done! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1590808612041273344))
	- Plus the ðŸš€ BONUS benefit of personal SOP checklists is that you're ready to delegate a task at a moment's notice.
	  
	  Which is very handy when it comes to delegating or hiring a VA or assistant. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1590808613450584065))
