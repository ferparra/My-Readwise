	- Announcing that a core part of [[@logseq]] is now scriptable with #NodeJS through https://t.co/LOP2T9AY5u! This means you can query and analyze your graphs with independent applications. Two specific use cases that are now possible: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cldwalker/status/1608941606643838976))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Node.js scripts can run any #Datalog query that the Logseq app can. These scripts run independent of a Logseq app and can run in CI environments like Github actions. Learn more at https://t.co/WQoKas6OyY ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cldwalker/status/1608941608543850496))
	- Node.js scripts can extract almost every actionable piece of text Logseq recognizes e.g. a url, property, page reference, etc. Learn more at https://t.co/GAR58lal0o ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cldwalker/status/1608941610137681921))
	- In @logseq's spirit of open source and local-first, this scripting pipeline gives apps full control to read graphs and can be deployed almost anywhere. I hope this encourages the community to build autonomous agents like slackbots and voice assistants on top of Logseq graphs ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cldwalker/status/1608941611660214273))
	- Thanks to #nbbjs for enabling nbb-logseq to be used as a library from #NodeJS scripts. Previously [[@logseq]] was mostly just scriptable through #ClojureScript scripts ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cldwalker/status/1608941613103067136))
