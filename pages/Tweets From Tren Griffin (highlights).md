	- @jmj CAC is a stone cold killer with no mercy for businesses that pay too much to acquire customers.

	- Jess Lee (Sequoia): “Culture* is a huge competitive advantage. What you're trying to do is build an operating system for your company, the same way you try to build a system for your product.”
	  
	  *Vision, values, norms, systems, symbols, language, assumptions, beliefs, and habits ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trengriffin/status/1094751536981278721))
	- @jdroege @sarahtavel That a tool can mislead or seduce doesn't mean it can't be useful when used properly. I prefer CBCV. Using a bottoms up unit economics model helps identify poseurs before tides going out. All models are wrong, some models are useful. @d_mccar @faderp https://t.co/yBTM9cgcxl ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trengriffin/status/1540429504417435649))
	- @semil Too many people, then and now, fail to understand that when Andy Rachleff created the term "product market fit" he included "the business model required to entice a customer to buy your product." It must be scalable and repeatable. There's more revenue now, but that's not cash. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trengriffin/status/1589070095871270912))
