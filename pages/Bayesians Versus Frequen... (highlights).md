	- Bayesians versus Frequentists is an ancient debate.
	  But have you heard of likelihoodism?
	  
	  ðŸ§µ A thread on likelihoodism, why no one uses it, and how it helps to understand the Bayesian versus Frequentist debate better. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChristophMolnar/status/1570383881639174145))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Likelihoodists honor the likelihood function above all else.
	  â€¢ They reject prior probabilities. That's a big middle finger to the Bayesian approach.
	  â€¢ Evidence from the data must only come through the likelihood. That's why they reject frequentist inference. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChristophMolnar/status/1570383886923735040))
	- I gotta explain the second point. It's not intuitive how frequentist modeling violates this "likelihood principle".
	  
	  In other words: in frequentist inference, information from the data influences the modeling, but is not part of the likelihood. Nani?? How can that be? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChristophMolnar/status/1570383892137529346))
	- Frequentists use hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. For these, they have to imagine experiments. These imagined repeated experiments influence the analysis but are not part of the likelihood. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChristophMolnar/status/1570383897380151298))
	- We get 3 tails out of 12 coin tosses.
	  
	  Is the coin significantly favoring head?
	  
	  Depends on the stopping criterion. Two different experiments that can produce same data:
	  
	  â€¢ We stop after 12 tosses: p = 0.073
	  â€¢ We stop after 3 tails: p = 0.0327 -> Significant ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChristophMolnar/status/1570383902350393344))
	- In the example, the frequentist analysis depends on how experiments are conducted went, and it's not reflected in the likelihood. The likelihoods are the same, up to a constant factor.
	  
	  A violation of the likelihood principle.

	- This violation touches on a philosophical assumption of frequentists: Probability is a long-run frequency. To turn long-run frequencies into a data-driven decision making-tool, frequentists violate the likelihood principle. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChristophMolnar/status/1570383912609910784))
	- Bayesians don't need long-run frequencies. They have a different idea of probability: Probability is a degree of belief about an event.
	  
	  Bayesians don't violate the likelihood principle. They use prior probabilities which don't use evidence from the data (with exceptions). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChristophMolnar/status/1570383917991211009))
	- Where does that leave likelihoodism? Likelihoodists see likelihood as a measure of evidence in favor of a statistical hypothesis.
	  
	  No prior distributions are needed.
	  
	  No imagined experiments are needed.
	  
	  Perfect, right? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChristophMolnar/status/1570383923494125569))
	- Still, nobody uses likelihoodism.
	  
	  Because likelihoodist analysis can't tell you what to do or what to believe.
	  
	  When we have two models representing different hypotheses, likelihoodism tells us to favor the one with the higher likelihood. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChristophMolnar/status/1570383929022246914))
	- But how do we know that the model is "significantly" better? We don't, because likelihoodists reject frequentism. We also can't say that we "believe" that one is better because this requires a Bayesian approach.
	  
	  That's why no one uses likelihoodism. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChristophMolnar/status/1570383934390931457))
	- To summarize:
	  
	  â€¢ Frequentism allows a decisions based on long-run frequencies
	  â€¢ Bayesianism enables an interpretation of belief
	  â€¢ Likelihoodism can't do either. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChristophMolnar/status/1570383939549765632))
	- But, surprisingly, learning about likelihoodism helped me greatly understand the difference between frequentism and Bayesianism better.
