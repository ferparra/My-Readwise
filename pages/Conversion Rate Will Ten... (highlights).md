	- Conversion rate will tend to go down as you get better at marketing, which is extremely counterintuitive to many people (including marketers), and sometimes you're "running to stay in place." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1321510312671989762))
	- "OK I need that explained explicitly."
	  
	  As you get better at marketing, the barrier required to find out about you gets lower. Prior to getting good/sophisticated/scaled, the leads you get are largely sophisticated early adopters who have a burning pain and searched exhaustively.

	- Once you get good, you will get some leads that didn't have to make it their life's work for 4 weeks to figure out your company existed, and *even if you are nowhere close to saturating the market* you will dilute the denominator of your conversion rate with "worse" leads.
	- They're worse in the sense that they'll convert as a lower rate, but they're not necessarily *bad* leads; whether they're good or not depends on your standard CAC vs LTV math.
	  
	  But but but but but they will not perform like your early adopters on churn rates, either.
	- Most businesses will attempt to counteract this by getting better at conversion to recoup some of the notional loss of conversion rate (again, a poor frame for thinking about it) and, wait for it, Charging More, because [[crossing the chasm]] ungates Basically All Of The Money.
	- A related factor: leads from different sources are generally lumped together in summary statistics but are often basically incomparable in terms of pre-signup and post-signup behavior.
	  
	  And attribution (in complex sales especially) remains a mostly unsolved challenge.
