	- 1/ We're introducing support for @Arbitrum today to the Synapse Network, starting with ETH transfers 
	  
	  This is the first ETH fast withdraw bridge back to EthereumðŸš€ 
	  
	  Move ETH to & from Arbitrum within minutes

	- 2/ This works by using an nETH <> Arbitrum ETH AMM pool, which prices the on and off-ramp slippage.
	  
	  Liquidity providers supply nETH and Arbitrum ETH to earn fees and SYN liquidity incentives

	- 3/ nETH is minted by bridging ETH from mainnet to nETH on Arbitrum using Synapse. 
	  
	  Once you have nETH on Arbitrum, pair it with native Arbitrum ETH to provide liquidity. 
	  
	  As the pool balances change, arbitragers will be incentived via a deposit bonus to rebalance the pool ðŸ“Š ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SynapseProtocol/status/1440446140478984199))
