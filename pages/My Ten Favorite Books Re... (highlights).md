	- My ten favorite books read in 2022, in chronological order ...
	  
	  1) Dreadnought, by Robert K. Massie. A moving portrait of the politicians and diplomats who sleepwalked into the First World War, framed within the narrative of the Anglo-German naval arms race.

	- 2) Apologies, one more military history. Meyer's *A World Undone*  applies the grace, poignancy, and raw excitement of Barbara Tuchman to the entirety of World War I. Listened to as an audiobook, which is brilliantly narrated by Robin Sachs.

	- 3) Finally got around to reading this after @oliverwkim pestered me for months. Most of you are familiar with the bellicist theory of state formation, so I'll just note that Tilly's explication of how the relative initial power of the landed and mercantile classes is fascinating.

	- 4) I've surely written enough praise of @MarkKoyama and @jaredcrubin's lovely book by now, but it'd be a mistake to omit it from this list -- really no other synthetic survey work of the economic history research over the last 20 years.

	- 5) A fabulous and comprehensive history of the Enlightenment in all its variegated forms. Chronicles the development of the novel, the birth of economics, the efflorescence of reason and philosophy (obviously), the forging of European empires, and everything else under the sun.

	- 6) Hatcher and Bailey lay out the major historical-theoretical models of England's transition from feudalism to capitalism. They critique the demographic, class struggle/Marxist/Brenner, and commercialization models in the light of (then-)recent evidence.

	- 7) Peer Vries attempts to demolish every existing theory of the Industrial Revolution in his typical acerbic prose by burying them with an insurmountable pile of obscure citations to historical development research. Not much more to be said. Essential.

	- 8) Though I was initially guarded, Inikori became one of my three favorite "explaining the Industrial Revolution" books. Boasts an endless tide of quantitative evidence on the connections between slavery and British development, tied together by a (rare) coherent model.

	- 9) The last third of this book is boring, but the first half perfectly blends intellectual history and biography, compellingly arguing that urban Scotland's fusion with England through the 1707 Act of Union sparked a literary, political, and revolution that shaped modernity.

	- 10) Too much competition for this last spot, but I've got to say that I haven't been so thoroughly engrossed by a fictional work as much as *Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell* in years. Fantasy wrapped within alternate English history -- should have read this years ago.

	- Goodreads claims that this is the full list. Only includes books that I've read completely and carefully, so excluding the many dozens of others that I skimmed.
