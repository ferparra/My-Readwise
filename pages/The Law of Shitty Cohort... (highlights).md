	- The Law of Shitty Cohorts.
	  
	  It's not unusual for a startup to have "meh" retention. But then usually, team says it will improve retention via better activation, lifecycle marketing, improving product features, etc.
	  
	  But the law of shitty cohorts says this is unlikely to happen. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1176218314311208960))

	- The reason is that the early cohorts of users -- let's say the first couple million or so -- are usually your best cohorts. They found you via word of mouth, they are the early adopters of tech, and you have no market saturation yet.
	  
	  However, as you scale, each cohort gets worse ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1176218315200450561))
	- In rideshare, all the urban dwelling power users who don't have cars, and use apps every day - they've all signed up. Now we're acquiring rural/suburban users who have cars and only use it to get to the airport. Huge difference.
	  
	  When you buy users with paid ads, it's even worse ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1176218315917676545))
	- So even while teams improve their product, activation, and lifecycle, there's an opposite (and sometimes even stronger force!) of worse cohorts joining your product over time.
	  
	  Inspired by the Law of Shitty Clickthroughs :)
