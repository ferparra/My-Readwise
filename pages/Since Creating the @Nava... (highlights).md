	- Since creating the @Navalmanack, I’ve been obsessed with the idea of Leverage — a mental model coined by @Naval.
	  
	  Here is an overview:
	  
	  L E V E R A G E — Thread #1: Introduction
	- Levers are force multipliers. 
	  
	  This is how some people can accomplish 10, 100x, or 1,000,000x what others can.
	  
	  Leverage can multiply outcomes from your effort, your skill, and your judgement.
	- Can you lift 800 pounds?
	  
	  You could with an 18 foot lever.
	  
	  Can you earn $50,000/year without working even 1 hour?
	  
	  You could with $1,000,000.
	  
	  Can you get 100,000 people to read your tweet?
	  
	  You could with 100 retweets.

	- You probably heard about a “lever” when learning about simple machines in elementary school. https://t.co/ZjEeBylof7
	- Lever (Noun): a rigid bar resting on a pivot, used to help move a heavy or firmly fixed load. https://t.co/ECgN8NusOy
	- Leverage (verb): Use (something) to maximum advantage.
	  
	  Also financial definitions:
	  
	  Verb: Use borrowed capital (to invest), expecting profits made to be greater than the interest payable.
	  
	  Noun: ratio of a company's loan capital (debt) to the value of its common stock (equity).
	- Now, we generalize “leverage” into a mental model...
	  
	  To slightly modify @Naval’s original formulation, there are four forms of leverage:
		- **Tags**: #[[favorite]]
	- *Tools* help an individual accomplish more. A skilled person with the right tools can build an entire house or cut down an entire forest. 
	  
	  Each of us uses incredibly powerful tools every day: cars, computers, communication infrastructure.
	- *People* can be force multipliers. Humans are natural cooperators. With clear communication and alignment, 1+1=3. 
	  
	  Employees, contractors, agencies, consultants, audience, and fans are all types of relationships that provide leverage.
	- *Capital* inherently provides leverage. The same investment decision with 10x the capital returns 10x the results.
	  
	  Capital can also be reinvested into other forms of leverage -- into people, tools, or products.
	- *Digital Products* include software, podcasts, books, songs, movies, tweets, apps, algorithms, etc.
	  
	  Created once, these assets can serve an infinite number of customers. This is a new thing for humans and we’re seeing some wild outcomes because of it.
	- Each specific application of leverage has a different margin, capital intensity, ceiling, gatekeeper, velocity, maintenance cost, and rate of entropy.
	- Those who focus on building, growing, and re-investing Leverage are playing a different game. 
	  
	  And the gap between the levered and the unlevered is going to keep growing.
	- There are already (many) million-dollar 1-person companies.
	  
	  Now, we are seeing billion-dollar 10-person companies.
	  
	  Bitcoin may be a trillion-dollar asset with one creator.
	  
	  This is the age of leverage. Learn to see it, learn to use it.

	- Simple example of the levels of leverage:
	- Like a teeter-totter, the lever works both ways.
	  
	  Multiplying positive force can make you.
	  Multiplying negative force can destroy you.
	  
	  Keep a healthy respect for the possible downside. Stay balanced.
	- Modern people can methodically apply, increase, and compound leverage until they stand on a MOUNTAIN OF LEVERS -- accomplishing 1,000x their peers.
	  
	  More to come.
