	- A big thank you to @sean__whit for sharing his insights.
	  
	  We've already implemented many of the learnings from his model into how we look at @heyequals.
	  
	  The one time I saw @zoink, he raved about the finance team and what a fantastic impact they had in the early days of Figma. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bobbypinero/status/1613590732258021376))
	- And a big shoutout to @chris_burgner for the idea for this series.
	  
	  One of the frustrating parts of our jobs as operators is how isolated we are from each others' learnings. We all start from scratch when building models.
	  
	  More models and templates from real businesses to come. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bobbypinero/status/1613590734879477760))
