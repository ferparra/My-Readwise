	- Playing around with some very fake yet still vaguely convincing rope physics https://t.co/V9QLjfqpIs ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/t3ssel8r/status/1470039981502922752))

	- the rope is a quadratic Bezier curve whose middle handle (gray dot) is attached to a spring/damper to a fixed point (red dot) some distance below the midpoint of the two ends depending on the amount of slack in the rope. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/t3ssel8r/status/1470039985076137985))
	- If the slack is negative, the spring constant is increased for a nice tightening/vibrating effect. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/t3ssel8r/status/1470039986762256388))
	- Inspired by the sheer impossibility of making ropes not go crazy unstable using stock #unity3d physics features. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/t3ssel8r/status/1470039988335099911))
