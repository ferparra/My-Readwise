	- Hey design tools and startups, if you're reading this thread, one major theme I'm seeing:
	  
	  Designers/devs don't actually want handoff.
	  
	  They want equal collaboration at all stages of the process.
	  
	  Don't create visual tools that favor one group and alienate the other 🙏 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano/status/1392628904037425154))
	- 💥 React tip: if you have an effect that needs to be executed when your app starts, it's definitely okay to execute it *outside* the component, and *not* in useEffect().
	  
	  This is especially true if the effect should only execute once, which is an unavoidable constraint sometimes.

	- ⚛️ React tip: for most forms, you don't need useState()... or any hooks at all! You can read form data directly from the form by element name:
	  
	  Object.fromEntries(new FormData(formEl));
	  
	  You don't even need a form library most of the time.

	- One common thing I hear is "state machines are only useful for complex logic."
	  
	  Most apps deal with events. State machines are a way to organize + visualize event handling logic, and you don't even need a library for them.
	  
	  It's more of a way of thinking than a tool.
