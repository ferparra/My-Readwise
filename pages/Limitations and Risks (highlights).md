	- [How can I retrieve K nearest embedding vectors quickly?](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/how-can-i-retrieve-k-nearest-embedding-vectors-quickly)
	  
	  For searching over many vectors quickly, we recommend using a vector database. You can find examples of working with vector databases and the OpenAI API [in our Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples/vector_databases) on GitHub.
