document_note:: This text from "The Systems Bible: The Beginner’s Guide to Systems Large and Small" explains the dangers of Systems and the importance of understanding the behavior of systems and how to work with them. It emphasizes the need for problem avoidance, choosing systems with care, and recognizing the inevitability of reality. It also discusses the importance of feedback, the concept of nipping disasters in the bud, and the fact that everything correlates. The overall message is that while Systems can be seductive, they must be approached with caution and an understanding of their behavior.

	- Malfunction is the rule and flawless operation the exception. Cherish your system failures in order to best improve ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmj59h66b612tqsk8vhwakx))
		- **Note**: This passage encourages readers to recognize and learn from system failures in order to develop and improve them.
	- Systems don’t enjoy being fiddled with and will react to protect themselves and the unwary intervenor may well experience an unexpected shock ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmj5wdfvcgyf2xb2bwr83vj))
		- **Note**: This passage warns that trying to meddle with a system can have unexpected consequences and can be dangerous. It suggests that systems have a protective mechanism which may cause a shock to the person trying to interfere.
	- "Anergy" is the unit of human effort required to bring the universe into line with human desires, needs, or pleasures. The total amount of anergy in the universe is constant. While new systems may reduce the problem it set out to, it also produces new problems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmj66r79rc4t007vrmjzbcr))
		- **Note**: This document explains that "anergy" is the unit of effort required to fulfill human desires, needs, or pleasures. It also states that the total amount of anergy in the universe is constant, but that while new systems may reduce one problem, they can also create new ones.
	- Reality is more complex than it seems and complex systems always exhibit unexpected behavior. A system is not a machine. It’s behavior cannot be predicted even if you know it’s mechanism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmj6w9atnqnkz6n8tkm44sb))
	- People in systems do not do what the system says they are doing. In the same vein, a larger system does not do the same function as performed as the smaller system. The larger the system the less the variety in the product. The name is most emphatically not the thing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmj75zy1vv8e2tc5zr47jgw))
		- **Note**: People in systems don't do what they think they are doing. Even if two systems are similar, a bigger system doesn't do the same thing as a smaller system. The bigger a system is, the less variety you get in the product. The name of the system is not what matters.
	- Designers of systems tend to design ways for themselves to bypass the system. If a system can be exploited, it will and any system can be exploited ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjqc11stsrqpvrf1qtz4nx))
	- If a big system doesn’t work, it won’t work. Pushing systems doesn’t help and adding manpower to a late project typically doesn’t help. However, some complex systems do work and these should be left alone. Don’t change anything. A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and can not be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system. Few areas offer greater potential reward than understanding the transition from working simple system to working complex system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjq81dvje9sjm0b2dnwzdg))
	- Knowledge is useful in the service of an appropriate model of the universe, and not otherwise. Information decays and the most urgently needed information decays fastest. However, one system's garbage is another system's precious raw material. The information you have is not the information you want. The information you want is not the information you need. The information you need is not the information you can obtain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjq3bz7qerhd04azr0f33h))
	- Problem avoidance is the strategy of avoiding head-on encounters with a stubborn problem that does not offer a good point d'appui, or toe hold. It is the most under-rated of all methods of dealing with problems. Little wonder, for its practitioners are not to be found struggling valiantly against staggering odds, nor are they to be seen fighting bloody but unbowed, nor are they observed undergoing glorious martyrdom. They are simply somewhere else, successfully doing something else. Like Lao Tzu himself, they have slipped quietly away into a happy life of satisfying obscurity. The opposite of passivity is initiative, or responsibility - not energetic futility. Choose your systems with care. Destiny is largely a set of unquestioned assumptions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmj7zm106cpasxat16vg9ta))
		- **Note**: Problem avoidance is a way to deal with a difficult problem when it doesn't seem like you can make any progress. It means you don't keep trying the same thing over and over - instead, you do something else. It's important to think carefully about the decisions you make, because those decisions will shape your future.
	- The very first principle of systems-design is a negative one: do without a new system if you can. Two corollaries: do it with an existing system if you can; do it with a small system if you can. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmj8tfgyvcftvnvqp4rf42r))
	- *Systems run best when designed to run downhill. In essence, avoid uphill configurations, go with the flow. In human terms, this means working with human tendencies rather than against them. Loose systems last longer and function better. If the system is built too tight it will seize up, peter out, or fly apart. Looseness looks like simplicity of structure, looseness in everyday functioning; "inefficiency" in the efficiency-expert's sense of the term; and a strong alignment with basic primate motivations*
	  
	  1.  *Slack in the system, redundancy, "inefficiency" doesn't cost, it pays* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmj8yxx4n2rwhrx6d5h4gyr))
		- **Note**: The Systems Bible advocates for designing systems to run downhill and work with human tendencies instead of against them. To achieve this, the system should be loose with a simple structure and an alignment with basic primate motivations. This slack, redundancy and "inefficiency" actually pays off in the long run, and will result in the system lasting longer and functioning better.
	- Calling it "feedback" doesn't mean that it has actually fed back. It hasn't fed back until the system changes course. The reality that is presented to the system must also make sense if the system is to make an appropriate response. The sensory input must be organized into a model of the universe that by its very shape suggests the appropriate response. Too much feedback can overwhelm the response channels, leading to paralysis and inaction. The point of decision will be delayed indefinitely, and no action will be taken. *Togetherness is great, but don't knock get-away-ness. Systems which don't know how much feedback there will be or which sources of feedback are critical, will begin to fear feedback and regard it as hostile, and even dangerous to the system. The system which ignores feedback has already begun the process of terminal instability. This system will be shaken to pieces by repeated violent contact with the environment it is trying to ignore. To try to force the environment to adjust to the system, rather than vice versa, is truly to get the cart before the horse*
	  
	  1.  *What the pupil must learn, if he learns anything, is that the world will do most of the work for you, provided you cooperate with it by identifying how it really works and identifying with those realities. - Joseph Tussman* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjmejjqsw0bkabcxzr80zm))
		- **Note**: Feedback is when something is sent back to a system after it does something. It is not really feedback until the system changes what it is doing based on what it received. The feedback must make sense so that the system can respond correctly. Too much feedback can confuse the system and it won't know what to do so it won't do anything. If a system doesn't know how much feedback to expect or which feedback is important, it will start to be scared of feedback and think it is dangerous. If a system ignores feedback, it will start to fall apart. It is important to remember that the world around us will help us if we understand how it works and cooperate with it.
	- Catalytic managership is based on the premise that trying to make something happen is too ambitious and usually fails, resulting in a great deal of wasted effort and lowered morale. On the other hand, it is sometimes possible to remove obstacles in the way of something happening. A great deal may then occur with little effort on the part of the manager, who nevertheless (and rightly) gets a large part of the credit. Catalytic managership will only work if the system is so designed that something can actually happen - a condition that commonly is not met. Catalytic managership has been practiced by leaders of genius throughout recorded history. Gandhi is reported to have said, "There go my people. I must find out where they are going, so I can lead them." Choosing the correct system is crucial for success in catalytic managership. Our task, correctly understood, is to find out which tasks our system performs well and use it for those. Utilize the principle of utilization ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmj9p6ha13ycas6pp1m07jb))
		- **Note**: Catalytic managership is a management approach that focuses on removing obstacles in order for something to happen, rather than trying to make it happen yourself. This approach has been used by successful leaders throughout history, such as Gandhi. The key to success in catalytic managership is to identify which tasks the system performs well and use it for those. The principle of utilization should be used to ensure success.
	- *The system itself does not solve problems. The system represents someone's solution to a problem. The problem is a problem precisely because it is incorrectly conceptualized in the first place, and a large system for studying and attacking the problem merely locks in the erroneous conceptualization into the minds of everyone concerned. What is required is not a large system, but a different approach. Solutions usually come from people who see in the problem only an interesting puzzle, and whose qualifications would never satisfy a select committee. Great advances do not come out of systems designed to produce great advances. Major advances take place by fits and starts*
	  
	  1.  *Most innovations and advancements come from outside the field* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjha9dhcmg4j18v1e21tjv))
		- **Note**: The system itself doesn't make things better. It's just someone's idea about how to solve a problem. The problem happens because it's not seen the right way, and having a big system just makes it harder to change the way it's seen. What we need is a different way of looking at it, not just a big system. The best ideas come from people who don't have the same kind of experience or qualifications as the people who usually work in the field. Most of the time, the biggest improvements don't come from big systems, but from people who look at the problem in a different way.
	- It is generally easier to aim at changing one or a few things at a time and then work out the unexpected effects, than to go to the opposite extreme, attempting to correct everything in one grand design is appropriately designated as grandiosity. *In dealing with large systems, the striving for perfection is a serious imperfection. Striving for perfection produces a kind of tunnel-vision resembling a hypnotic state. Absorbed in the pursuit of perfecting the system at hand, the striver has no energy or attention left over for considering others, possibly better, ways of doing the whole thing* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjkqfg6tzcbs3hc9bex8tp))
		- **Note**: This text warns against trying to make too many changes to a large system at once, as this can lead to a "grandiosity" that is ultimately a serious imperfection. Such tunnel-vision can also lead to a hypnotic state where the individual is so focused on perfecting the system they are working on that they have no attention left for considering other, possibly better, ways of doing it.
	- Nipping disasters in the bud, limiting their effects, or, better yet, preventing them, is the mark of a truly competent manager. Imagination in disaster is required - the ability to visualize the many routes of potential failure and to plug them in advance, without being paralyzed by the multiple scenarios of disaster thus conjured up. In order to succeed, it is necessary to know how to avoid the most likely ways to fail. Success requires avoiding many separate possible causes of failure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjht8r7brpf5a9m3g7n2mz))
		- **Note**: A great manager is able to recognize a problem before it becomes a disaster, stop it from growing worse, or even stop it from happening in the first place. To do this, they need to be able to imagine all the different ways a problem might happen and plan out ways to stop it from happening. In order for a manager to be successful, they need to be able to think of all the different ways a problem might happen and find ways to stop them.
	- *Be weary of the positive feedback trap. If things seem to be getting worse even faster than usual, consider that the remedy may be at fault. Escalating the wrong solution does not improve the outcome. The author proposes a new word, "Escalusion" or "delusion-squared or* *D**2**", to represent escalated delusion* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjj6rykqnj9d23je3jq2v4))
		- **Note**: This text cautions against the "positive feedback trap", which occurs when a solution is applied that further exacerbates the problem. The author introduces the term "Escalusion" or "D2" to represent escalating a delusion in order to emphasize this concept.
	- *Reframing is an intellectual tool which offers hope of providing some degree of active mastery in systems. A successful reframing of the problem has the power to invalidate such intractable labels as "crime", "criminal", or "oppressor" and render them as obsolete and irrelevant as "ether" in modern physics. When reframing is complete, the problem is not "solved" - it doesn't even exist anymore. There is no longer any problem to discuss, let alone a solution.* If you can't change the system, change the frame - it comes to the same thing. The proposed reframing must be genuinely beneficial to all parties or it will produce a destructive kickback. A purported reframing which is in reality an attempt to exploit will inevitably be recognized as such sooner or later. The system will go into dense mode and all future attempts to communicate will be viewed as attempts to exploit, even when not so motivated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjjhrqbg65j6yg2aqsz9v0))
		- **Note**: Reframing is a tool which can help to provide some control and mastery over systems. This can involve changing the labels of certain words, such as "crime" or "oppressor", to something more modern, such as "ether". Although the problem may not be "solved", the reframing can make the issue obsolete. It is important to note that any reframing must be beneficial to all parties, or else it will result in a destructive backlash. If a reframing is seen as an attempt to exploit, then all future attempts to communicate will be similarly viewed.
	- *Everything correlates - any given element of one system is simultaneously an element in an infinity of other systems. The fact of linkage provides a unique, subtle, and powerful approach to solving otherwise intractable problems.* As a component of System a, element x is perhaps inaccessible. But as a component of System B, C, or D...it can perhaps be affected in the desired direction by intervening in System B, C, D... ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjjv4f42ve0mewjtkhmckp))
		- **Note**: This passage emphasizes the idea that elements of a system are linked to elements in an infinite number of other systems, making it possible to solve otherwise intractable problems by intervening in other systems. It suggests that if an element is inaccessible in one system, it can often be affected in a desired direction by intervening in other related systems.
	- In order to remain unchanged, the system must change. Specifically, the changes that must occur are changes in the patterns of changing (or strategies) previously employed to prevent drastic internal change. The capacity to change in such a way as to remain stable when the ground rules change is a higher-order level of stability, which fully deserves its designation as Ultra-stability ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjk34dka6bkwbz7w9zq9ct))
		- **Note**: This passage explains that in order to remain the same, a system must be able to adapt to new changes. This adaptation needs to involve changes to the strategies previously used to prevent large internal changes. This ability to change and remain stable when external conditions change is referred to as Ultra-stability.
