	- What work do I feel most proud of?
	  Are there themes in these projects I should be thinking about? What’s the big picture of what I’m working on? (am I working a lot on security? localization?).
	  What do I wish I was doing more / less of?
	  Which of my projects had the effect I wanted, and which didn’t? Why might that have been?
	  What could have gone better with project X? What might I want to do differently next time?
