document_note:: This podcast explores the importance of play in human development and how it impacts our physiology and brain. It discusses how play releases natural opioids from the periaqueductal gray, releases BDNF, and engages the vestibular system, as well as how different age groups play differently. It also looks at how play allows us to explore different outcomes in a low-stakes environment, how it helps us understand ourselves and others, and how it helps us form our identity as adults. Finally, it looks at how economics, technology, and sociocultural environment affects our play identity.
