	- Controls pleasure, motivation, drive, craving, time perception, movement. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrollo1402/status/1570784890991546368))
	- Dopamine will drop below baseline after peaking with some goal achievement/reward, for days, sometimes. Also, your baseline and response will lower if you keep seeking pleasurable experiences over and over. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrollo1402/status/1570784894388961287))
	- Satisfaction will be a measurement of each peak in relation to your baseline. So, you should avoid inconsequential decrease of your baseline and cheap dopaminergic behavior, having more available when it matters. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrollo1402/status/1570784898096730116))
	- Another way to leverage it is by randomly skipping rewards and avoiding stacking dopaminergic associations to activities (like listening to music while working out) to release less dopamine and maintain your baseline, protecting your motivation sensibility.

	- Caffeine, on the other hand, makes the dopamine released from an activity more accessible and functional, by increasing the density and efficacy of its receptors. Also yerba mate, plus it's high in antioxidants and GLP-1, favorable for managing blood sugar levels. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrollo1402/status/1570784905017294851))
	- Non adapted deliberate cold exposure can increase noradrenaline and dopamine up to 2.5x above baseline for 3h. Same effect if you try to stay calm (stress resilience) or shiver (fat burn). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrollo1402/status/1570784908611825664))
	- Working only for the sake of a reward that will come afterwards can make it more challenging and us less likely to do it in the future because of the way dopamine affects time perception and only being released at the reward.

	- This relates to growth mindset, pleasure from the process, from conquering the effort (deliberate effort exposure).In summary: don't spike dopamine before or after an effort, learn to spike it from effort itself. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrollo1402/status/1570784915775688704))
