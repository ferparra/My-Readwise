	- Well a [[philosophy of life]] consists of two things:

	- Stoicism says the goal of life is something akin to ‘tranquility’ – a deeper sense of wellbeing that is constant despite the ups and downs of everyday life.
	- stoicism includes specific strategies to a) prevent or reduce the impact of negative emotions and b) extract the full value out of the moments and interactions we have.
	- At the core of many of these strategies is the idea of reframing a situation – thinking about or approaching a situation in a different way that helps prevent negative emotions and also help extract greater value from it.
