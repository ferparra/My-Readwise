	- The Difference Between Emotion and Feeling
	  
	  Summary:
	  In psychology, we imagine emotions to be more like automatic emotions. That's the way of most people talk about emotions. And you can see emotions happening in people's brains in like milliseconds from stimuli. So what's the difference between an emotion and feeling? Well, if you've studied with me before, feeling tends to be the longer term interpretation of the emotion. I always use the same metaphor because it's only when I ever found people understand.

Or you see something that's beautiful or the kid says something, you just feel this emotion of joy. You don't have to work for the emotion. The emotion is automatic. It is immediate. It is physical and biological, right? That's the way of most people talk about emotions. And you can see emotions happening in people's brains in like milliseconds from stimuli, right? From stimulus. So what's the difference between an emotion and feeling? Well, if you've studied with me before, feeling tends to be the longer term interpretation of the emotion, right?
