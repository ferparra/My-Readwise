	- Just finished my first week of workshops as part of @ljin18's  Creator Economy Course, here are some takeaways for me: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cameron_amini/status/1365427859372802052))

	- 1/
	  First off, cohort based courses are game-changers. I felt I learned way more in two three hour workshops from an (THE) expert then I did spending twice that amount of time reading blog/newsletters posts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cameron_amini/status/1365427862522724354))

	  The caveat there is it depends on the course director, so YMMV. 
	  
	  If you have somebody with deep expertise who will go above and beyond (and a team that will do the same), it beats self directed learning by a mile. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cameron_amini/status/1365427863730728964))

	  The iceberg effect is real. 
	  
	  It's easy to think you understand the lay of the land in a space if you read most of the content available on it.
	  
	  Nope. There was so much I didn't know I didn't know ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cameron_amini/status/1365427864825389056))
	- 4/ 
	  One of my favorite takeaways:
	  
	  Creators are acutely aware of their overall follower count but often lack insight into how many of their fans are casual fans, active fans, or super fans (and the new segments of cult followers and speculators)

	- 5/ 
	  Giving creators more insight into their fan distribution can be super helpful in terms of guiding their monetization strategies.
	  
	   Different monetization strategies work for different levels of fans, and creators ultimately use a variety. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cameron_amini/status/1365427867191037957))
	- 6/
	  Anybody aware of strategies/tools creators could use that can help with 'fan segmentation'? 
	  
	  Could also be helpful feedback for creators to understand what content leads to deeper levels of engagement ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cameron_amini/status/1365427868373815300))
	- 7/ 
	  The course also offers lots of opportunity to network with and learn from others who share the same interests and its also really cool to be taught live by somebody you admire ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cameron_amini/status/1365427869325930500))
	- 8/
	  Overall, 10/10 would recommend. 
	  
	  Take Li's course if you're interested in the creator economy and don't be surprised to see cohort based courses continue to take off ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cameron_amini/status/1365427870374518787))
	- 9/
	  Correction: 3 hours of workshops (not two 3-hour workshops). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cameron_amini/status/1365429412708184065))
