	- ðŸ“¢ Tana is now on iOS!
	  
	  I've wanted this for the longest time, and I'm so excited that it's now finally here!
	  
	  Let me show you what you can do with it!

		- **Note**: Thread
	- The app is called Tana Capture and it lets you do what it says on the tin: easily capture anything you'd want while you're on the go!
	  
	  Voice Memos? âœ…
	  Photos? âœ…
	  Text? âœ…
	  Text scanned from paper books you're reading? âœ…
	  
	  It's awesome.

	- Naturally you can also share things from anywhere on iOS through the share sheet.
	  
	  I use this _all the time_ to share quotes from Readwise into Tana.
	  
	  Not a full integration between Readwise and Tana yet, but daaamn is it convenient!

	- If you read most of your books on paper, you'll LOVE Tana Capture's "Scan Text" feature â€“ makes it super convenient to get _any_ text into Tana!

	- Adding photos, either directly or from your media library on iOS if of course also possible, as is just writing some text.
	  
	  But the KILLER FEATURE is voice capture: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1652977455798562816))
	- Tana Capture comes with a voice memo feature.
	  
	  It's super convenient, but most importantly it's MINDBLOWINGLY USEFUL â€“ because since last week, Tana can no only auto-transcribe your voice notes...but with Tana AI you can SUMMARIZE THEM TOO.

	- Enjoyed this thread?
	  
	  If you use Tana, you'll love my template Tanarian Brain! It's a fully featured implementation of a Second Brain in Tana and comes with built-in support for PARA, Zettelkasten, GTD, AND has AI built into it too!
