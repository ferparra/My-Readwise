	- the full meaning of Freedom can be found out only progressively; only in a process that becomes clearer in the life of the individual ([subjective spirit](https://hegel.net/en/spirit.htm/e31.htm)) as well as for societies([ethical life](https://hegel.net/en/spirit.htm/e323.htm)) as they evolve or develop, as well as for humanity in general (e.g. the progress of world history and [absolutespirit](https://hegel.net/en/spirit.htm/e33.htm)).

	- [Subjective Spirit](https://hegel.net/en/spirit.htm/e31.htm) is potential force, while [ObjectiveSpirit](https://hegel.net/en/spirit.htm/e32.htm) is force in action, and [Absolute Spirit](https://hegel.net/en/spirit.htm/e33.htm) is the goal, aim or target of the force as well as the reflection (realization) of the targets (See also:[Teleology](https://hegel.net/en/spirit.htm/e1323.htm)).
