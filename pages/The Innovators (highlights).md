	- [Ada Lovelace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace)
	  
	  •   Ada Byron was the only daughter of [Lord Byron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron) and became enchanted with the beauty of both poetry and science
	  •   Known for answering the question - can machines truly think? (No)
	  •   Worked with [Charles Babbage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage) on his analytical engine and was credited with much of the work - one of the first general computation machines
	  •   Was quite arrogant about her intellect and he drastic mood swings which were exacerbated by opiates she was taking as medicine
	  •   Her and Babbage had a falling out and they both died in poverty. She of uterine dancer at age 36
	  •   One of the first to truly understand and appreciate the future of cooperation between man and machine
	  •   Many of her ideas and visions would take over 100 years to come to fruition ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4r0a5tpbpekb79apxn1ffv))

		- **Note**: Ada Byron was the daughter of Lord Byron, who was a famous poet. Ada loved both poetry and science. She was very smart and believed that machines could think. To prove this, she worked with Charles Babbage on his analytical engine, which was one of the first machines that could do many things. Ada was very proud of her work and her intelligence, but sometimes this made her very angry. She and Charles Babbage disagreed and they both passed away in poverty. Ada was one of the first people to understand that machines and people could work together in the future and many of her ideas and visions came true over 100 years later.
	- [Alan Turing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)
	  
	  •   Born in 1912 and was quite shy and enjoyed the solitude of long distance running and biking. Turing was homosexual and his first love died soon after meeting him and found it hard to form serious relationships after that
	  •   Grappled with the idea of if the mind is distinct from a deterministic machine - thought yes but not as clear as he originally thought
	  •   [The Turing Test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) - ask a series of questions and try to determine based on the answers if it is a person or a computer
	  •   Turing began working at Princeton in 1937 to break German codes as well as encrypt the U.S. Messages enough so they couldn't be broken (good timing with [*The Imitation Game*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5CjKEFb-sM) recently coming out in theaters depicting these events)
	  •   People found out Turing was gay and gave him the option of either going to jail or get hormone injections. Chose injections but committed suicide a year later by biting into an apple laced with cyanide ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4r1s1hn8c5fp24ftpj6se1))

		- **Note**: Alan Turing was born in 1912. He was very shy and liked to go running and biking by himself. He was also gay and his first love died soon after they met. This made it hard for him to form relationships. Turing thought that the mind was different from a computer, but he wasn't sure. He created the Turing Test which asked questions to try to figure out if it was a person or a machine. In 1937, Turing worked at Princeton to break German codes and make sure US messages could not be broken. People found out he was gay and gave him the choice of going to jail or getting hormone injections. He chose the injections but one year later he committed suicide by eating an apple with poison in it.
