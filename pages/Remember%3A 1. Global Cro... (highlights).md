	- Remember:
	  
	  1. Global crop failures by 2Â°C.
	  2. Most humans dead by 4Â°C.
	  3. Earth uninhabitable by 6Â°C.
	  4. We risk 2Â°C by 2035.
	  5. We risk 4Â°C by 2065.
	  6. We risk 6Â°C by 2095.
	  
	  One tweet is worth a million newspaper front pages. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ClimateBen/status/1386042740136349700))
	- 1. It will never be too late to try to limit the damage/suffering of the expanding ecological-climate catastrophe by challenging media silence, destructlive growth & short-term profit maximization.
	  
	  We need economic system change action now to avoid 3-4C by 2050-2100.

	- 2. 'Risks of simultaneous crop failure.. increase disproportionately between 1.5 and 2Â°C'
	  
	  Over 1.5Â°C represents 'a threat to global food security'

	  'Agriculture is already at moderate risk, which becomes high risk around 2 degrees' https://t.co/UlcVuhTkiV https://t.co/tN1jnJQGgx ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ClimateBen/status/1386067605665030157))
	- 3. Meta-analysis: 70% of studies show declines in crop yields by the 2030s (half indicate 10â€“50% declines):

	  We are in the danger zone.
	  
	  2Â°C will hit as early as 2034-2038 without stunning emissions cuts towards zero in the 2020s.

	- 4. Scientists still hope to stay below 2.5C but it would take a 'herculean effort' to avoid 4C, at which point 'mass death' would be likely:
	  
	  From 2011

	  And from 2009: 4C by the 2060s if emissions don't peak & plummet by the 2030s:

	- 5. This recent study confirms 3-4Â°C looks increasingly likely by 2050-2100 as emissions continue to rise, and that >5C by the end of the century is beyond catastrophic for humanity, and entirely possible.
	  
	  We must change everything to protect everybody.

	- 6. This is tough information to take in. I feel better when I try to take action to support the Climate Justice Movement which has known for decades that capitalism must be transformed and replaced for decent survival. Individual-collective action is possible. Keep going. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ClimateBen/status/1386080504139681801))
	- 7. Just to add, here's a thread full of key info on parts per million of CO2 (ppm) in the atmosphere and 'CO2-e' which includes all greenhouse gases and forcings. The thread has two more sources on 5-6Â°C being enough to make the planet uninhabitable. https://t.co/Ilns7A0iK1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ClimateBen/status/1386094363554586628))
