	- 1/ Why your startup can’t “Just Do It” or “Think Different.”
	  
	  Startup marketing needs to play by different rules. 
	  
	  A Tweetstorm your agency might not like. 👇🏼

	- 2/ Writing a good headline is incredibly hard, especially for your own startup.
	  
	  Here’s 4 of the best performing headlines I’ve ever seen. 
	  
	  Notice, they aren’t clever or inspiring. They don't “sound like marketing.” Just boring & functional. What’s going on?

	- 3/ Here’s the weird thing: Great startup marketing doesn’t sound like marketing at all. 
	  
	  And that’s tough, because every marketer wants to write the next “Just Do It” or “Think Different.” But you can’t compare startups to established brands. 
	  
	  Why not? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/matthlerner/status/1414871014610243589))
	- 4/ Nike and Apple spent 40+ years building brands. Everyone understands what they do, so their ads can be ephemeral and allusive, quirky and inspiring. But yours cannot. (yet)

	- 5/ Take heart! Apple and Nike used to be startups too! And back then, they had boring, functional messaging explaining what they were about. Before they earned the right to “Just Do It.”

	- 6/ Before you can inspire, first explain what the heck you do. 
	  
	  Actually that’s wrong. Nobody cares what you do. They care what THEY can do.
	  
	  What’s the diff?
	  
	  Successful messages don’t talk about the product, they talk about what they help people achieve. Try this simple test: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/matthlerner/status/1414871027549720576))
	- 7/ Go look at your headline, but insert the words “Now you can” before it, and read it out. Does it sound awkward? (e.g. "Now you can the all-in-one flexible HR software”)? Then you’re talking about your products rather than your customers. That’s bad. Instead, try this... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/matthlerner/status/1414871029038657536))
	- 8/ Instead, go back and think: what is your customer’s “now you can?” What are they struggling/hoping to do? And make that your headline.
	  
	  Time and again, I see this headline format convert 5X - 10X better. (With one big caveat!) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/matthlerner/status/1414871030330535938))
	- 9/ Shifting to the 2nd person is a start, but it’s not enough. Check these headlines, both “now you can…” but #2 converted 10X better.
	  
	  You need to find exactly the right “now you can ____.” promise. 
	  
	  So, how do you find exactly the thing your prospects are struggling to do?

	- 10/ That's the fundamental question for a startup! 
	  
	  I can’t explain it in a Tweet, but my partner Nopadon covers it beautifully here:
