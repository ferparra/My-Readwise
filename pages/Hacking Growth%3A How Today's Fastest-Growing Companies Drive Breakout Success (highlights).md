	- Finding growth solutions *fast* is crucial in today’s ever-more-competitive and rapidly changing business landscape. By revolutionizing the long-established business processes for developing and launching products, institutionalizing continuous market testing, and systematically responding to the demands of the market in real time, growth hacking makes companies much more fleet-footed. It enables them to seize new opportunities and correct for problems—fast. This gives those who adopt the method a powerful competitive advantage, one that will become even more powerful as the pace of business continues to accelerate.

	- By breaking down those barriers growth hacking enables teams and companies to become more nimble and responsive to the ever-changing demands in the market, accelerating the rollout of new products and features as well as the crafting and implementation of marketing and sales strategies critical to attracting, activating, and monetizing customers.

	- the process is not, as it’s been misunderstood by some, about discovering one “silver bullet” solution. The press coverage of many of the widely celebrated growth hacks, such as the Dropbox customer referral program and Airbnb’s integration into Craigslist, has encouraged this notion that one great hack is all you need to ignite growth. But while finding such big breakthrough ideas—like Dropbox’s referral program—is absolutely a goal of the process, in truth, most growth is due to an accumulation of small wins. Like compounding interest in a savings account, these gains stack on top of one another to create liftoff. And the best growth teams continue to experiment with improvements even once growth takeoff has been achieved. Later in the book we’ll profile how leading growth teams, such as those at Facebook, LinkedIn, Uber, Pinterest, and the team at Dropbox, continue to work furiously every day on generating, testing, and refining ideas for new growth hacks.
	  
	  Second, many companies believe they can simply hire a single Lone Ranger to be *the* growth hacker, who will swoop in with a bag of magic tricks to bring growth to their business. This, too, is badly misguided. Throughout the book we show that, in reality, growth hacking is a team effort, that the greatest successes come from combining programming know-how with expertise in data analytics and strong marketing experience, and very few individuals are proficient in all of these skills.
	  
	  Growth hacking is also too often thought to be all about devising clever work-arounds that break the rules of existing websites and social platforms. But despite what the well-publicized story of Airbnb’s Craigslist hack would have you believe, flouting rules is by no means required and in fact plays no part in most growth success. That *was* a stroke of genius, but such “backdoor” tactics are not core to the method; and most growth professionals groan at the mention of the case. The real story in the Airbnb case is that they ran a host of experiments to find growth, most of which failed, before they came up with the Craigslist hack, and they have continued to grow the business through rigorous experimentation and testing with strategies that are completely aboveboard.

		- **Note**: Growth hacking is a process that involves an accumulation of small wins to create growth. It is not about finding one silver bullet, but rather is a team effort requiring expertise in programming, data analytics, and marketing. Most growth successes come from strategies that are aboveboard, not from breaking existing rules. The Dropbox customer referral program and Airbnb's integration into Craigslist are examples of successful growth hacks, but these are only two of many.

	- Generally, the product team is in charge of the process of building the product, as well as of making updates, such as improving the sign-up experience or adding a new feature, and the team establishes a schedule, commonly referred to as a roadmap, for making those improvements. Often, ideas for changes that aren’t part of the preestablished roadmap are met with resistance. Sometimes it’s because timing is already tight for making the planned enhancements, and sometimes because the changes being asked for are poorly conceived, much more difficult, time-consuming, and therefore costly, to enact than the person making the requests is aware of. Yet other times the product team might also determine that a request isn’t aligned with the strategic vision for the product (or some combination of all these factors and others).
	  
	  Even if you don’t work for a tech company, you may be familiar with this kind of tension between departments, maybe with marketing teams pushing back on suggestions from sales, or the R&D team resisting a request to build a prototype for a new product that marketing has recommended. This is one of the chief problems with the practice of siloing responsibilities by departments, and it’s primarily why, as you’ll learn more about in a minute, growth teams must necessarily include members across a range of specialties and departments. As the BitTorrent team soon realized, often the best ideas come from this type of cross-functional collaboration, which, again, is why it’s a fundamental feature of the growth hacking process.

		- **Note**: Growth hacking involves breaking down departmental siloes and cross-functional collaboration in order to create ideas for product updates. This helps to prevent ideas from being rejected due to resistance from departments such as product, marketing and R&D. Ideas are often rejected because they are difficult to implement or don't align with the product's strategic vision. By involving members from different departments, the best ideas can be identified and implemented.
	- This collaborative approach is unfortunately the exception, rather than the rule, at companies of all types and sizes. The all too common practice of siloing business units into isolated groups that rarely talk, share information, or, God forbid, actually collaborate, has been a widely acknowledged organizational Achilles’ heel at many companies for many years. As highlighted by a McKinsey report, one of the most damaging effects of departmental silos is that they slow innovation that drives growth. But while, as the authors explain, “research shows that the ability to collaborate in networks is more important than raw individual talent to innovativeness,” a survey McKinsey conducted found that “only 25 percent of senior executives would describe their organizations as effective at sharing knowledge across boundaries, even though nearly 80 percent acknowledged such coordination was crucial to growth.”[1](#c01-fnt1)
	  
	  Similarly, a team of Harvard Business School professors who conducted a study of communication across business units reported that they were “taken aback” by how little interaction there was among units they uncovered. Even more shocking: they reported that “two people who are in the same SBU [strategic business unit], function, and office interact about 1,000 times more frequently than two people at the company who are in different business units, functions, and offices, but are otherwise similar. Practically speaking, this means that there is very little interaction across these boundaries.”[2](#c01-fnt2)
	  
	  One specialist on the silo problem, Professor Ranjay Gulati of Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, notes that this lack of cross-departmental communication impedes efforts to make product development and marketing more customer focused—an increasingly important mandate as technology and social media facilitate, even demand, ever more substantive and continuous interaction with customers. Put simply, engineers and product designers are quite capable of coming up with marvelous ways to satisfy customers’ needs and desires, but they most often are simply not privy to what those needs and desires are. Gulati reports that in a survey of executives he conducted, over two-thirds of them identified the need to make product development more customer-centric as a priority in the coming decade, but he also writes that his research shows that companies’ “knowledge and expertise are housed within organizational silos, and they have trouble harnessing their resources across those internal boundaries in a way that customers truly value and are willing to pay for.”[3](#c01-fnt3)
	  
	  Creating cross-functional growth teams is a way to break down these barriers. Cross-functional teams not only smooth and accelerate collaboration between the product, engineering, data, and marketing groups, they motivate team members to appreciate and learn more about the perspectives of the others and the work they do. So how, exactly, does one set up a growth team to meet the strategic needs and priorities of a specific project or initiative? We’ll address the key steps in the pages that follow.

		- **Note**: The common practice of siloing business units into isolated groups that rarely collaborate has been identified as a major organizational problem. Research shows that the ability to collaborate is more important than individual talent to innovation, however, only 25% of executives believe their companies are effective at sharing knowledge across boundaries. A study of communication across business units showed low levels of interaction between departments, and Professor Ranjay Gulati of Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management has noted that this lack of communication impeded efforts to make product development and marketing more customer-centric. Creating cross-functional growth teams is proposed as a way to break down these barriers and facilitate collaboration.
