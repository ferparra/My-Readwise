	- The most sought-after exec coach in Silicon Valley coached @naval.
	  
	  Then went on to coach the CEOs of Reddit, OpenAI, Coinbase....even Sequoia Capital.
	  
	  Here are 5 “MAGIC” questions he has all his leaders ask their teams: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1579121739186872320))

	- You can’t actually hire Matt Mochary as a coach.
	  
	  As @balajis would say, he is “post-economic.” He only works for the people he chooses.
	  
	  His clients are either the fastest-growing tech companies or the top 5 VC firms.
	  
	  Fortunately, he is very generous with sharing his techniques ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1579121741854408705))
	- Matt has a list of questions he asks execs to motivate their teams.
	  
	  The questions are so effective they feel like “magic.”
	  
	  He calls them the MAGIC QUESTIONS. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1579121744471728129))
	- The magic in these questions is that they immediately get below the surface.
	  
	  When asking these questions, you show your team:
	  
	  1) You want them to get to their highest level of potential
	  2) They have great ideas about how to get there
	  3) You care about them ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1579121747017617414))
	- All of the questions use a simple follow-up and are based on the following scale:
	  
	  1 - It couldn’t be any worse
	  3 - Meeting expectations
	  5- It couldn’t be any better
	  
	  Let’s break them down: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1579121749559369728))
	- 1.  HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT YOUR LIFE AT WORK?
	  
	  Why this works:
	  
	  This question makes them feel seen and heard as people, not employees.
	  
	  As a leader, you also get critical context on how to support them at work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1579121752046649344))
	- 2.  HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT YOUR WORK-FROM-HOME SET UP?
	  
	  Why this works:
	  
	  If you are even partially remote, this helps you understand if there are any productivity blockers.
	  
	  You’ll find out if there are any inexpensive items that could make a difference. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1579121754617761799))
	- 3.  HOW ARE WE PERFORMING AS A COMPANY?
	  
	  Why this works:
	  
	  You get an assessment of company performance against THEIR expectations.
	  
	  Their ideas about how the company could do better enters the conversation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1579121757201448961))
	- 4.  WHAT IS IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THE REST OF THE TEAM?
	  
	  Why this works:
	  
	  The day-to-day of what it feels like to be on your team gets a chance to be expressed.
	  
	  The good and bad of team dynamics get the attention it deserves. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1579121759785082881))
	- 5.  WHAT IS IT LIKE TO WORK WITH ME?
	  
	  Why this works:
	  
	  Most managers don’t know what it feels like to report to them.
	  
	  You get direct feedback about what it is like to be in their shoes to work with you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1579121762390138880))
	- After each of these questions, it's critical to ask: “What would get it to the next level?”
	  
	  Most people have great ideas on how to improve things when asked in a structured way. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1579121764969287685))
	- Every time I use these questions, I receive:
	  
	  -incredible understanding of how my team is feeling
	  -fabulous, actionable insights on how to improve as a leader and a company ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1579121767624212480))
	- And for your team:
	  
	  -When you can make the next level clear...
	  -And help them achieve the next level...
	  
	  Motivation goes THROUGH THE ROOF ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1579121770186956800))
	- You might not have the ability to hire a world-class coach.
	  
	  But you can give these questions a try and see what you notice.
	  
	  The questions are free, but the insights from your team are invaluable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1579121772695199744))
