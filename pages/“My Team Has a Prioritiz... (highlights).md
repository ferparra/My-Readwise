	- ‚ÄúMy team has a prioritization problem. Help!‚Äú 
	  
	  Product prioritization, a thread:
	  (1/30) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105221570228224))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Most product prioritization problems are really strategy problems.
	  
	  So you need to start with strategy.
	  
	  There are 4 types of strategy problems. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105222522376192))
	- 4 strategy problems
	  
	  -Acceptance: ‚Äúwe dont think strategy is important‚Äù 
	  
	  -Creation: ‚Äúwe know it‚Äôs important but we dont have one‚Äù
	  
	  -Substance: ‚Äúwe have one, but it‚Äôs flawed‚Äù
	  
	  -Communication: ‚Äúwe have a good strategy, but the team doesnt grok it/can‚Äôt recall it/can‚Äôt describe it‚Äù ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105223541567488))
	- So if, as a product leader/CEO, you think your team isn‚Äôt
	- Now, let‚Äôs say you have a sound strategy that is very well-communicated i.e. everyone on the team can describe the main pillars of your strategy clearly & succinctly, along with the rationale for said strategy.
	  
	  Wonderful. You‚Äôre now in the upper 10% tier of product teams. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105225399586816))
	- Most of the prioritization problems that really matter in the long game should now be history.
	  
	  But I'm sure you want more.
	  
	  So what can you do next to make product prioritization work even better?
	  
	  It‚Äôs Systematic Planning. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105226309824512))
	- For Systematic Planning, the highest leverage technique is to clarify the key themes and investment allocation for the next 12 months / 6 months / 3 months (whatever is the right time granularity for you to be doing planning for your industry / product category). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105227224150016))
	- Make sure that everyone is clear on this allocation.
	  
	  For instance, way back in the day, Google invested 70 / 20 / 10 % of its time across search+ads / apps / other bets.
	  
	  This sort of X/Y/Z % framework can be quite clarifying when you‚Äôre leading a portfolio of distinct products. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105228088143872))
	- Now, what if you aren‚Äôt leading a product portfolio? Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre leading a single product. How should you think about themes & allocation then? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105229015076864))
	- At the level of a single product, you can think of allocation across these themes:
	  1) Differentiators
	  2) Tablestakes
	  3) Incrementals
	  4) Embarrassments (or ‚ÄúBroken Windows‚Äù)
	  5) Customer Specials (or ‚ÄúLarge Customer Requests‚Äù)
	  6) Speculative Bets
	  7) Tech Foundation ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105229921079297))
	- (of course, as you think through these themes and their relative importance for your product right now, make sure to keep the user/customer at the core of your thinking) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105230898360326))
	- Note that ‚ÄúTech Foundation‚Äù is a catch-all to include Reliability, Security, Eng Productivity, Infra, etc. You can (and often should) extract one or more of these into a top-level theme.
	  
	  You can also treat certain themes as one unit (e.g. ‚ÄúTablestakes + Incrementals‚Äù). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105231762350080))
	- Now, before moving on, I‚Äôd suggest reading the previous 3 tweets again, internalizing them & considering what themes make most sense to prioritize for your product for the next 12/6/3 months.
	  
	  If you do that, you'll be in the top 25% within the top 10% tier of product teams. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105232618041344))
	- For a given 3 month/6 month period, it‚Äôll rarely be the case that you need to prioritize every single theme above.
	  
	  For instance, for one of the products I led in recent years, here‚Äôs the allocation for a given quarter:
	  60% Differentiators
	  30% Tech Foundation
	  10% Speculative Bets ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105233507176448))
	- Naturally, the next question will be: how do you decide on what themes matter most & what investment to allocate across those themes? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105234383863808))
	- This is where your judgment as a product leader is vital. No spreadsheet, now matter how colorful, its fancy weighted formulas or pivot tables, its underlying research/analytics insights, is going to answer this for you. Use all these inputs, of course, but don‚Äôt forget judgment. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105235163934720))
	- I tend to use the power of questions to exercise my judgment for the key themes. I'll list some of those questions in the next few tweets.
	  
	  1) What do we need to do in the next N months to make the most meaningful progress towards our strategy?
	  
	  üëáüèæ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105236048998400))
	- Questions (contd.)
	  
	  2) What key risks do we need to mitigate or eliminate? (e.g. an important customer that might churn, a major systems liability, etc.)
	  
	  3) To what degree do we need to play Offense in the next N months vs. play Defense?
	  
	  üëáüèæ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105237030420480))
	- Questions (contd.)
	  
	  4) How important is growth right now vs. protecting what we have vs. laying the foundation for future growth?
	  
	  5) Are we currently in Explore mode with this product or Exploit mode?
	  
	  üëáüèæ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105237948952576))
	- Questions (contd.)
	  
	  6) What strategy-aligned efforts will help address the team problems I want to see solved/mitigated in the next N months? (e.g. morale boosting features, execution-enabling "incrementals", frustration-removing technical foundation work, etc.)
	  
	  üëáüèæ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105238842335233))
	- Questions (contd.)
	  
	  7) What key initiatives have the greatest Expected Value and what themes do they fall in? (quasi bottoms-up)
	  
	  8) What is largely in my or my team‚Äôs control, on what do we rely on other teams, and what are the risks there? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105239748308992))
	- There are potentially other context-specific questions too, but hopefully this gives you the general picture. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105240616525825))
	- After working through these questions, getting feedback from team members who have relevant/different context, making appropriate corrections, it‚Äôs now time to clarify how you‚Äôd like your team to allocate their efforts over a given quarter/half-year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105241400885248))
	- By now, you‚Äôve shared the strategy with your org, the key themes for the quarter/half, the target allocation across these themes (at the level of the org, not individual teams)
	  
	  Whats next?
	  If you have capable user-centric teams, it‚Äôs time to let bottoms up planning do its magic. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105242285854721))
	- Let the teams propose with the features/initiatives/etc. that they think will make the greatest impact. Your role from this point is to track how the planning process is progressing, share your take on team's questions & clarify things that you feel particularly strongly about. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320106032840859648))
	- It‚Äôs fine to use a prioritization framework (e.g. RICE) to come up with the list of things that are above/below the line for the given timeperiod. Make sure these ‚Äúthings‚Äù are concrete and have clear criteria for how they‚Äôll be accomplished (a launch, an experiment, metrics, etc) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320106033604251648))
	- Also fine to use RICE or similar prioritization framework to evaluate new surprises/requests that come up after planning is done. Just make sure to use your strategy, key themes, and target allocation as a compass when you do so, and don‚Äôt *accidentally* veer away from them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320106034426306560))
	- There‚Äôs a lot more to discuss here w.r.t. ongoing tracking of progress, escalations, dealing with new information, surprises (esp. unpleasant ones), etc. but hopefully this thread has been a helpful POV on how to view prioritization as a systematic process & your role in it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320106035223277570))
	- Last but not least, there are a number of other valid ways to do prioritization and there are no ‚Äúrules‚Äù here. So feel free to mix and match these and other ideas to create your own, context-appropriate approach to prioritization.
	  
	  Best of luck! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320106035957280768))
