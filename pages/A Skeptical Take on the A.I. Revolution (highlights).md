	  This great philosophy paper by Harry Frankfurt called On Bullshit? I know the paper. So this is a welcome to the podcast, everybody. This is a philosophy paper about what is bullshit? And he writes, quote, the essence of bullshit is not that it is false, but that it is phony. In order to appreciate this distinction, one must recognize that a fake or a phony need not be in any respect, apart from authenticity itself, inferior to the real thing. What is not genuine, do not also be defective in some other way. It may be after all an exact copy. What is wrong with a counterfeit is not what it is like, but how it was made. And his point is that what's different between bullshit and a lie is that a lie knows what the truth is and has had to. Move in the other direction. He has this great line where he says that people telling the truth and people telling lies are playing the same game, but on different teams. But bullshit just has no relationship, really, to the truth. ([TimeÂ 0:13:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/59419614-3eeb-4017-a9bd-12f10e4eff84))
