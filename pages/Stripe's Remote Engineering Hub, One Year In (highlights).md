	- Scheduled unstructured hangout sessions have also multiplied. We’ve seen parallel #TEAM-social channels adjacent to most #TEAM-work channels on Slack so that team members have an outlet to post about kids, hobbies, and other watercooler banter subjects without feeling like they’re intruding on a workspace. We’ve also experimented with entirely virtual offsites, particularly the bonding component. One team ran a simulated lunar crash exercise that required participants to collectively identify and rank the most critical tools needed to survive.
	- We support this bottom-up transformation with more explicit company-wide direction so that we can meet our goals in remote hiring across technical and non-technical functions alike. We expect the number of remote-eligible roles will continue to grow; changes caused by COVID-19 are accelerating this transition.
