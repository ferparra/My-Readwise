	- On average, testosterone levels have been steadily dropping about 1% per year.
	  
	  Men today have about 50% of the testosterone their grandfathers had at their age
	  
	  Why is this the case? And what can we do about it?
	  
	  Let’s get into it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1528828259030515712))
	- As testosterone has decreased, we’ve only become weaker, sicker, and less happy.
	  
	  What does this decline in testosterone mean for men?
	  
	  -Lower libido
	  -Lower muscle mass
	  -Lower bone density
	  -Lower sperm count
	  -Increased fat production
	  
	  And so much more. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1528828260293005314))
