	- I revisited Bret Victor‚Äôs ‚ÄúLearnable Programming‚Äù post -
	  
	  This has better advice for building dashboards than anything I‚Äôve seen.
	  
	  It turns out we should be building programmable environments.

	- Eliminate state. If you can‚Äôt, make it visible.
	  
	  I do this all the time. Ever get questions like ‚Äúdoes this include cancelled orders?‚Äù Add a dashboard filter with exactly one preselected choice: ‚ÄúCancelled - NO‚Äù
	  
	  In Looker this is called always_filter

	- Make meaning transparent. I can make a dashboard 10x more usable just with thoughtful labeling alone.
	  
	  A stand-alone data dictionary does not help here. We need clear, in-context labels and an allergy to jargon.

	- Don‚Äôt dump an empty canvas in front of someone. Let them create by reacting to a fully realized data viz as a starting point.
	  
	  This touches every aspect - from how your dashboard hub is organized, to default values for filters.

	- There‚Äôs a lot more I need to reflect on. I can‚Äôt help but feel like this area of analytics is vastly misunderstood. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teej_m/status/1403072371271954434))
