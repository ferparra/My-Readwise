	  It used to be available as different mode so you could use 3.5 Turbo or Browsing mode but couldn't summon browsing from Default mode before.
	  
	  It changes with this rollout. It is big deal. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/VisualVichaar/status/1651526039871315968))

	  This means its ChatGPT can reference web data if needed and not limited to cut off of 2021
	  
	  Here is a example where it decides to browse without being called
	  
	  PS: From openAI documentation it uses Bing web search API to find source website unless you provide it

	  I have used chatGPT to get all this information about itself. Using these functions can make it very powerful to 
	  
	  load a page
	  go to a page
	  Click, search, quote, scroll
	  
	  and then apply usual chatGPT actions to it
	  These can be accessed via API as well.
	  
	  Will add example here ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/VisualVichaar/status/1651526094586015745))

	  Here is the code ChatGPT provided  that shows how it might work in future. ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
	  
	  Looks like full API support is coming soon for browsing. 
	  
	  It's not working for me at the moment. 
	  
	  If anyone gets it working please reply here and let everyone know üôè

	- Many are asking how did I get access to this
	  
	  Here is what I did. I signed up here the way these were released
	  
	  Important point to remember is that there are different waitlists you can join. I only joined browser initially and haven't gotten any other kind of plugin access‚Ä¶
