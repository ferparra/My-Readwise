	- **Ethics** or **moral philosophy** is a branch[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics#cite_note-:0-1) of [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) that "involves systematizing, defending, and recommending [concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept) of [right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality) and wrong [behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(philosophy))".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics#cite_note-iep.utm.edu-2) The field of ethics, along with [aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics), concerns matters of [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(ethics)); these fields comprise the branch of philosophy called [axiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiology).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics#cite_note-3) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmywkep685wzqrakvyfw15wp))
	- Three major areas of study within ethics recognized today are:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics#cite_note-iep.utm.edu-2)
	  
	  1.  [Meta-ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics), concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how their [truth values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_value) (if any) can be determined;
	  2.  [Normative ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics), concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action;
	  3.  [Applied ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_ethics), concerning what a person is [obligated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obligation) (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics#cite_note-iep.utm.edu-2) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmywkx1nynzk642gagefmjtr))
	- Moral skepticism (or moral scepticism) is a [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(philosophy)) of [metaethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics) theories in which all members entail that no one has any moral knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmywnbp1yg204ec0jb2nsnr8))
	- Normative ethics is the study of ethical action. It is the branch of ethics that investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. Normative ethics is distinct from [meta-ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics) because normative ethics examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts.

	- Virtue ethics describes the character of a moral agent as a driving force for ethical behavior, and it is used to describe the #ethics of early Greek philosophers such as [[Socrates]] and [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle), and ancient Indian philosophers such as [Valluvar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valluvar). [Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates) (469â€“399 BC) was one of the first [Greek philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophy) to encourage both scholars and the common citizen to turn their attention from the outside world to the condition of humankind.

	- The [Stoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) philosopher [Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus) posited that the greatest good was contentment and serenity. Peace of mind, or [[apatheia]], was of the highest [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(ethics)); self-mastery over one's desires and emotions leads to spiritual peace. The "unconquerable will" is central to this philosophy. The individual's will should be independent and inviolate. Allowing a person to disturb the mental equilibrium is, in essence, offering yourself in slavery. If a person is free to anger you at will, you have no control over your internal world, and therefore no freedom. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmywqgy8gttq5dcb8h7w04d0))
	- Modern virtue ethics was popularized during the late 20th century in large part due to a revival of [Aristotelianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelianism), and as a response to [G.E.M. Anscombe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.E.M._Anscombe)'s "[Modern Moral Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Moral_Philosophy)". Anscombe argues that [consequentialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialist) and [deontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological) ethics are only feasible as universal theories if the two schools ground themselves in [divine law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_law). As a deeply devoted Christian herself, Anscombe proposed that either those who do not give ethical credence to notions of divine law take up virtue ethics, which does not necessitate universal laws as agents themselves are investigated for virtue or vice and held up to "universal standards", or that those who wish to be utilitarian or consequentialist ground their theories in religious conviction.

	- [Mortimer J. Adler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortimer_J._Adler) described Aristotle's [Nicomachean Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics) as a "unique book in the Western tradition of moral philosophy, the only ethics that is sound, practical, and undogmatic."[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAdler1985194-25) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyws643x5b3gd43cy0gppq4))
	- Hedonism posits that the principal ethic is maximizing [pleasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure) and minimizing [pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmywt4p8wqz1ntmz9a0bdw7k))
	- To Epicurus, the *summum bonum*, or greatest good, was prudence, exercised through moderation and caution. Excessive indulgence can be destructive to pleasure and can even lead to pain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmywtnaathzbqrkmaqvkatky))
	- Death was not to be feared. Fear was considered the source of most unhappiness. Conquering the fear of death would naturally lead to a happier life. Epicurus reasoned if there were an afterlife and immortality, the fear of death was irrational. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmywtyj5eyyvs46v6h3vhbkb))

	- Consequentialism refers to moral theories that hold the consequences of a particular action form the basis for any valid moral judgment about that action ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmywvqv45a3r0t894yjxwmfg))
	- Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that argues the proper course of action is one that maximizes a positive effect, such as "happiness", "welfare", or the ability to live according to personal preferences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyww8m700n61p73b5f4k0tt))

	- Utilitarianism is the paradigmatic example of a consequentialist moral theory. This form of utilitarianism holds that the morally correct action is the one that produces the best outcome for all people affected by the action.

	- Kant argues that to act in the morally right way, people must act from duty (*Pflicht*).[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics#cite_note-46) Second, Kant argued that it was not the consequences of actions that make them right or wrong but the motives of the person who carries out the action.

	- Associated with the [pragmatists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism) [Charles Sanders Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce), [William James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James), and especially [John Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey), pragmatic ethics holds that moral correctness evolves similarly to scientific knowledge: socially over the course of many lifetimes. Thus, we should prioritize social reform over attempts to account for consequences, individual virtue or duty (although these may be worthwhile attempts, if social reform is provided for) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmywz4nywwqzvkrkrpce9wwc))
	- [Antihumanists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihumanism) such as [Louis Althusser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Althusser), [Michel Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault) and [structuralists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism) such as [Roland Barthes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Barthes) challenged the possibilities of individual agency and the coherence of the notion of the 'individual' itself. This was on the basis that personal identity was, in the most part, a social construction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmywzszphzfpb83t791dfs68))
	- [Jean Baudrillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard) theorised that signs and symbols or simulacra mask reality (and eventually the absence of reality itself), particularly in the consumer world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyx0hrk77aa21azaph4r7pq))
