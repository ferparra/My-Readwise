- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 21st, 2022]]
	- [[Socrates]]' classical inquiry method of engaging in cooperative dialogue and
	  responding to everything with a question. Enabled critical thinking and
	  scepticism of every possible assumption and presupposition in an argument.
	- Another classic. Hypothesis, empirical observation, experiments, and
	  shared cumulative facts fundamentally changed our ability to understand
	  the physical world around us. Allowed us to harness that information in
	  the service of disciplines like engineering and medicine.
	- Rene Descartes' system of assigning numbers to points on an X - Y - Z
	  axis. Allows us to model and map areas of 3D space using precise
	  measurements. Enabled us to draw up plans for objects and structures that
	  don't yet exist. Also enabled mapping latitude and longitude points on
	  earth, and eventually GPS
	- Zettelkastens â€“ 1500sAn information management system based around linked index cards. Each
	  card holds a single belief or succinct statement, a unique number or code,
	  and links to its source references and any related cards. The system
	  allows researchers to collect and organise large amounts of information,
	  and create many flexible 'chains' of cards to synthesise into original
	  arguments.
