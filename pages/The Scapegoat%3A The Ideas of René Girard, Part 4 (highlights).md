document_note:: René Girard's ideas influenced social scientists over his long career. He proposed the 'mimetic theory', which states that human societies organize themselves around scapegoats in order to contain their inherent violence. He believed that the Christian New Testament exposes scapegoating by definitively revealing the innocence of the victim, and this revelation of innocence affected the world. His books have been translated from French to English, and include Deceit, Desire and the Novel (1966) and Violence and the Sacred (1977).
