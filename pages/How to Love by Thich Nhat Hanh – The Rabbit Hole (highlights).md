	- True love is made of four elements: loving kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity
	- To love is, first of all, to accept ourselves as we actually are
	- We should practice in such a way that every moment is fulfilling. We should feel satisfaction in every breath, in every step, in every action
	- Understanding someone’s suffering is the best gift you can give another person. Understanding is love’s other name. If you don’t understand, you can’t love.
	- In true love there is no place for pride.
	- Your good intentions are not enough; you have to be artful.
	- The Six Mantras
	  
	  I am here for you – The greatest gift we can make to others is our true presence.
	  I know you are there and I am happy
	  I know you are suffering
	  I am suffering
	  This is a happy moment – when you’re sitting together, walking together, eating, or doing something together, breathe in mindfully and realize how lucky you are. Mindfulness makes the present moment into a wonderful moment.
	  You are partly right – You are not a victim of illusion because you know that you’re not perfect. And when another person criticizes you, you can also say, “You are partly right.”
