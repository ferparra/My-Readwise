	- New preprint on a theory for navigation in complex environments. With Tony Zhang @tonyzhang_, Matt Rosenberg @MH_Rosenberg, and Pietro Perona @PietroPerona. https://t.co/yA8h5hsNO0. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mameister4/status/1441898143172284418))

	- 2/ Since the dawn of time animals have sniffed their way through the environment in pursuit of food: chemotaxis. Our new paper suggests that evolution may have reused that behavioral module to solve more general cognitive tasks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mameister4/status/1441898144313135109))
	- 3/ We show how an animal might learn a cognitive map of the environment, mark the interesting locations with an odor tag, and sniff its way back to those places by the shortest path. Except the odors aren’t real…

	- 4/ The brain can compute a virtual odor, tag it to a location, and simulate the spread of the odor through the cognitive map. Then it follows that endogenous goal signal using the chemotaxis behavior: “endotaxis”.

	- 5/ The whole algorithm can be implemented with a biologically realistic neural circuit, using only local synaptic learning rules. Along the way that circuit solves the All-Pairs-Shortest-Path problem on a graph.

	- 6/ Circuits with this structure are found in brains from insects to humans. We suggest that endotaxis is part of the repertoire by which animals navigate, especially useful for fast learning during early experience with a new environment. https://t.co/eU45kax9yR ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mameister4/status/1441898155872698374))
