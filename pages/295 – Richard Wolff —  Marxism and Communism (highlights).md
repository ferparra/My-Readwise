	- Who Gets This Extra Stuff?
	  
	  Summary:
	  Mark argues that the minute you understand this, who gets the surplus? Who gets this extra stuff that is made but not consumed by those who made it? And mark's answer is, therein lies one of the great shapers of any society. Communism would be if the workers who produce the surplus together decide what to do with it. That's the closest mark comes to a definition of communism.

	  Speaker 1
	  Now, Marx argues, the minute you understand this, you will ask the following question. Who gets the surplus?
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  Who gets this extra stuff that is made but not consumed by those who made it?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  And Marx's answer is therein lies one of the great shapers of any society.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  How is that organized?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  For example, who gets it? What are they asked, if anything, to do with it in exchange, forgetting it? What's their social role? For example, here we go now. If you get this and you get the core of it anyway.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  And I don't charge much. The workers themselves could get it.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  That's right. The workers themselves could get it.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  That's the closest Marx comes to a definition of communism.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Communism would be if the workers who produce the surplus together decide what to do with it.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So this has to do not just with who gets it, but more importantly, who gets to decide who gets it.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, who gets it and who gets to decide what to do with it? Because you can't decide it if you don't have disposition over it. ([Time 0:44:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2bd12694-5e77-41da-bfd8-6e9dcb557ae9))
