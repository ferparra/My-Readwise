	- A resilient structure or system is one which can bounce back to its original form after some stimulus.
	- To improve your resilience is to increase the effort it takes for a stimulus to force you off your baseline while also increasing your ability to adapt and bounce back once it happens.
	- Resilience is not robustness
	- Failures are often helpful to release resources and reset and trying to stop these small failures make systems more fragile and will eventually lead to a massive failure.
	- Optimism and confidence are some of the best traits to deal with depression and to become more resilient
	- To improve resilience you often need to work in more than one mode and one scale and one silo at a time. Take the granular and the global into account simultaneously
	- In risk management, risks tend to be modeled as additive but in reality they are multiplicative. One failure makes future failures multiples more likely
	- Protocols are the lingua Franca of systems
	- Improving resilience is not about removing every possible disturbance. In fact, facing challenges which test you or your organization are vital. They show where improvements need to be made and can clear the path for creative destruction
