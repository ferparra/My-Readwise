	- Market share for DeFi TVL used to be 97% concentrated on one blockchain, but it's increasingly distributing across multiple blockchains.

	- The higher the velocity and shorter duration of the use case in question, the less the underlying chain matters. And DeFi is pretty high velocity.
	  
	  So this industry becomes commoditized, with whales chasing temporary arbitrage opportunities across chains, and minimizing fees. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1509255765315534851))
	- Art NFTs are lower velocity than DeFi, and so there has been somewhat less fee/scaling pressure to hop across chains. Ethereum still maintains huge market share there.
	  
	  As OpenSea adds other chains, maybe the NFT market share will open up more too?

	- In any industry, analogue or digital, one must ask what the economic moat is.
	  
	  If there's no moat, then the service becomes mostly commoditized, with users continually seeking out the lowest fees and smoothest experience. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1509255767710478347))
	- Scaling challenges can present a negative network effect for DeFi. It becomes about scale and efficiency, which are often at odds with decentralization and security.
	  
	  That's the long-term challenge for smart contract platforms in general; they're competing as tech middle-men. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1509255768956194817))
	- Over time, we should expect trade costs for most things to trend toward zero.
	  
	  The exception is for giant settlement transactions or long duration positions, where quality assurances matter for everything, and even then only a tiny % of the settlement value in fees makes sense. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1509255770105393169))
