document_note:: Positioning is a concept that focuses on communicating effectively in an overcommunicated society. It is not about creating something new, but manipulating what is already in the mind of the prospect. It involves sharpening messages to cut into the mind and reinforcing the original concept. It is important to establish a unique position with appeal that is not too narrow, which may involve sacrifice. Strategies for positioning include looking for creneaus, such as size, price, sex, timing, age, time of day, heavy-user position, etc. The key is to look inside the prospect's mind and position the product in the mind of the prospect.

	- Positioning starts with a product. A piece of merchandise, a service, a company, an institution, or even a person. Perhaps yourself. But positioning is not what you do to a product. **Positioning is what you do to the mind of the prospect. That is, you position the product in the mind of the prospect.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gss34haw4psrrvw21pbnkpbf))
	- The best approach to take in our overcommunicated society is the oversimplified message. In communication, as in architecture, less is more. You have to sharpen your message to cut into the mind. You have to jettison the ambiguities, simplify the message, and then simplify it some more if you want to make a long-lasting impression.

	- The French have a marketing expression that sums up this strategy rather neatly. Cherchez le creneau. ‚ÄúLook for the hole.‚Äù Cherchez le creneau and then fill it. That advice goes against the ‚Äúbigger and better‚Äù philosophy ingrained into the American spirit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gss34w7zsxys8q7yayspxbgk))
		- **Note**: This article emphasizes the importance of looking for a niche in the market, rather than trying to outdo competitors with bigger and better products. The French expression "Cherchez le creneau" is used to illustrate this strategy, which translates to "look for the hole".
	- ‚Ä¢   **Inside-out thinking is the biggest barrier to success. Outside-in thinking is the best aid.**
	  ‚Ä¢   **This, of course, is the essence of positioning. To make your brand name stand for the generic. So the prospect freely uses the brand name for the generic.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gss65djzegxa7g51pg3y4y95))
		- **Note**: "Inside-out thinking means you think about yourself first. Outside-in thinking means you think about others first. This is the most important part of positioning. Positioning is when you make your brand name mean the same thing as a generic name. That way people will think of your brand when they think of the generic name."
	- The most difficult part of positioning is selecting that one specific concept to hang your hat on. Yet you must, if you want to cut through the prospect‚Äôs wall of indifference. What are you? What is your own position in life? Can you sum up your own position in a single concept? Then can you run your own career to establish and exploit that position? Most people aren‚Äôt ruthless enough to set up a single concept for themselves. They vacillate. They expect others to do it for them.

		- **Note**: Positioning is an important marketing strategy that requires selecting a single concept to focus on. It is difficult to do and requires self-awareness and determination to establish and exploit a position. Most people are unable to do this as they lack the necessary ruthlessness and instead expect others to do it for them.
	- **What position do you own? Positioning is thinking in reverse.** What position do you want to own? Whom must you outgun? Do you have enough money? Can you stick it out? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gss3ebje4k5ghtdpza0gx9mc))
	- **Often the solution to a problem is so simple that thousands of people have looked at it without seeing it. When an idea is clever or complicated, however, we should be suspicious. It probably won‚Äôt work because it‚Äôs not simple enough. The history of science is a history of the Ketterings of this world who found simple solutions to complex problems.** This calls for great restraint and subtlety. The big winners in business and in life are those people who have found open positions near the center of the spectrum. Not at the edge.

	- The essence of positioning is sacrifice. You must be willing to give up something in order to establish that unique position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gss63rr00fmqmmk6fasa9e7h))
	- To repeat, the first rule of positioning is: To win the battle for the mind, you can‚Äôt compete head-on against a company that has a strong, established position. You can go around, under or over, but never head to head. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gss63y7a95kf8x5jkvqe6znj))
		- **Note**: Positioning is a strategic concept in marketing, where a business strives to make their product or service stand out in the minds of their target customers. The key to successful positioning is to avoid competing head-on with a company that has an established position in the market, but instead to go around, under or over them to create a unique positioning for the product or service.
