	- My first rule about performance reviews?
	  
	  ABSOLUTELY NO SURPRISES.
	  
	  If you're "saving up" feedback to go over during a performance review -- don't.
	  
	  Performance reviews are stressful enough.
	  
	  No one needs to hear performance feedback for the the first time during that meeting. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rhein_wein/status/1597162812429647872))

	- I have a 4-part blog series on painless and productive performance review.
