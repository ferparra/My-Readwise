	- Want to easily turn a JSON object into a zod schema, like for validating webhook payloads?
	  
	  Use this awesome little tool! 
	  
	  (it also has LOTS of other very useful conversions)

	- If using @nextjs & want end-to-end typesafety without a codegen step (needed for REST/GraphQL), I highly recommend checking out @blitz_js RPC package.
	  
	  Add incrementally to any nextjs app, & you get robust, typesafe, & elegant client/server communication.

	- ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ I've always shied away from writing SQL because I don't know it well. 
	  
	  But suddenly it's EASY.
