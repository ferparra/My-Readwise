	- So I just had one of those moments that you live for as a scientist. 
	  
	  I‚Äôve been working for weeks on a ‚Äúfirst principles‚Äù theory for the rate that soil erodes under a rocket. This was motivated by the sudden realization how to solve a key parameter from the reduced gravity data.

	- 2/ Those experiments showed that the soil erosion rate increases inversely to gravity (makes sense‚Ä¶) except when gravity is as low as lunar gravity, then it is no longer proportional. (https://t.co/fvh88kWc8t)

	- 3/ So on Mars with 3/8 of Earth‚Äôs gravity, soil erosion will be 8/3 times (2.67x) as fast. But on the Moon with 1/6 of Earth‚Äôs gravity, it is NOT 6x as fast but only 3.4x as fast. So that raises the question, why?

	- 4/ We have known for 12 years now that the erosion rate follows this form (with exponents in denominator both =1), but our reduced gravity data weren‚Äôt good enough due to experimental problems to quantify the deviation from the inverse gravity scaling.

	- 5/ I‚Äôm not going to tell too much right now since this will be published and shouldn‚Äôt get too far ahead of that process, but I will say that the reduced gravity data have proven the exact physical mechanism that governs the erosion rate.

	- 6/ Over the past two weeks I worked to finish the theory, and it closes. The theory can be developed from ‚Äúfirst principles‚Äù, meaning there are no parameters in the equation that need to be measured by experiment. Theory predicts all the parameters.

	- 7/ So the next step is to compare predictions of the theory with the Apollo landing videos. Now at this point there are some parameters that theory cannot predict, since we lack a good calibration of the film used in the old Apollo cameras. (https://t.co/CeiYTLKUIa)

	- 8/ We don‚Äôt know the white level of these film cameras, and since the brightness of the blowing dust is everything, there is some room to fool ourselves. So take the next tweet with a grain of salt. There is still more work to do. https://t.co/evUvrHdSdK ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrPhiltill/status/1606465152747986946))
	- 9/ So here‚Äôs the plot that gave me a moment that scientists live for. The new theory vs. Apollo 16 landing video. It matches perfectly. The 1 parameter I guessed is white balance of the film, but that can only shift the plot up or down. The perfect shape was natural. üò≠

	- 10/ I thought I‚Äôd share a bit of the excitement of the work ‚Äúas it happens‚Äù, and I want to say again that the investment we make in #NASA is constantly paying off. We are making daily progress to get humanity back to the Moon, this time to stay. https://t.co/47dOPDPF2r ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrPhiltill/status/1606470284139282434))
	- 11/ And a shoutout to the NASA Flight Opportunities program and to the @NASA_Technology program. The reduced gravity flights they funded were performed over a decade ago but we are still extracting data that has real-world application. For example‚Ä¶

	- 12/ when many actors are working on the Moon, the supersonic spray of dust will be ‚Äúsandblasting on steroids‚Äù so we need to figure out how to keep everyone from interfering with each other‚Äôs missions.

	- 13/13 The reduced gravity experiments are directly helping to solve this technical and geopolitical challenge. /end üßµ

	- @piskvor @jabe8 We had a student do her master‚Äôs thesis on long-term evolution of the ejecta cloud in the Earth-Sun-Moon gravity fields and solar wind. More work is still needed on this. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrPhiltill/status/1606490340776607751))
