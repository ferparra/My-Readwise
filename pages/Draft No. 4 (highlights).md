document_note:: Draft No. 4 is a document full of advice from a renowned author on the process of creative writing. Major takeaways include the importance of starting with a subject, understanding the tension between chronology and theme, recognizing that readers are not meant to notice the structure, writing a lead to illuminate the structure problem and give structure to the piece, and writing with selection, making the most of what you have. The author also emphasizes the importance of leaving out the author as much as possible and giving elbow room to the creative reader.

	- **Another way to prime the pump is to write by hand.** Keep a legal pad, or something like one, and when you are stuck dead at any time – blocked to paralysis by an inability to set one word upon another – get away from the computer, lie down somewhere with pencil and pad, and think it over. This can do wonders at any point in a piece and is especially helpful when you have written nothing at all. Sooner or later something comes to you. Without getting up, you roll over and scribble on the pad. Go on scribbling as long as the words develop. Then get up and copy what you have written into your computer file.

		- **Note**: Writing by hand is another way to get your ideas flowing. Keep a notebook or something like it, and when you're feeling stuck and can't think of any words to write, step away from the computer and lie down with a pencil and paper. Think it over and soon you'll have some ideas. Keep writing on the paper until you have some words, then get up and copy what you wrote into your computer.
	- **Writing is selection.** Just to start a piece of writing you have to choose one word and only one from more than a million in the language. Now keep going. What is your next word? Your next sentence, paragraphs section, chapter? Your next ball of fact. You select what goes in and you decide what stays out. At base you have only one criterion: if something interests you, it goes in – if not, it stays out. That’s a crude way to assess things, but it’s all you’ve got. Forget market research. Never market-research your writing. Write on subjects in which you have enough interest on your own to see through all the stops, starts, hesitations, and other impediments along the way. Ideally, a piece of writing should grow to whatever length is sustained by its selected material – that much and no more. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq6mq7yzgcsraqfeq9f5q0t))
		- **Note**: Writing is like choosing something. When you start writing, you have to choose one word from a million words in the language. Then you keep going, picking what you want to include in your writing, and deciding what to leave out. Your only rule is to put in what interests you and leave out what doesn't. Don't worry about what other people like. Just write about what interests you and write until it's as long as it needs to be.
	- **Hemingway sometimes called the concept the Theory of Omission. In 1958, in an “Art of Fiction” interview for The Paris Review, he said to George Plimpton, “Anything you know you can eliminate, and it only strengthens your iceberg.”** To illustrate, he said, “I’ve seen the marlin mate and know about that. So, I leave it out. I’ve seen a school (or pod) of more than fifty sperm whales in that same stretch of water and once harpooned one nearly sixty feet in length and lost him. So, I left that out. All the stories I know from the fishing village I leave out. But the knowledge is what makes the underwater part of the iceberg.” In other words, there are known knowns – there are things we know. We also know there are known unknowns. That is to say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don’t know we don’t know. Yes, the influence of Ernest Hemingway evidently extended to the Pentagon. Be that as it might not be, Ernest Hemingway’s Theory of Omission seems to me to be saying to writers, “Back off. Let the reader to the creating.” To cause a reader to see in her mind’s eye an entire autumnal landscape, for example, a writer need only deliver a few words and images – such as corn shocks, pheasants, and an early frost. the creative writer leaves white space between chapters or segments of chapters. The creative reader silently articulates the unwritten thought that is present in the white space. Let the reader have the experience. Leave the judgment in the eye of the beholder. When you are deciding what to leave out, begin with the author. If you see yourself prancing around between subject and reader, get lost. Give elbow room to the creative reader. In other words, to the extent that this is all about you, leave that out. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq6ksam04cqbfjvjjf50jfa))
		- **Note**: Hemingway had an idea called the Theory of Omission. In 1958, he said in an interview that if you know something, you can leave it out and it will make your writing better. To explain, he said he had seen a marlin mate and knew about it, but he decided to leave that out. He had also seen and harpooned a sperm whale, but he left that out too. He said that the knowledge he had was like the "underwater part of the iceberg" - it's still there, but you can't see it. He was saying that some things we know (known knowns), some things we don't know (known unknowns), and some things we don't know we don't know (unknown unknowns). Hemingway's idea was that writers should just let the reader do the creating, so they should leave out some of the things they know, and give the reader some "elbow room" or space to imagine. That way, the reader can use their own creativity to fill in the gaps.
