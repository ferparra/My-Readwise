	- “Mental toughness is often portrayed as determination and persistence, but it can also be flexibility and adaptability. – I can be happy anywhere. – I can work with what I have. – I can have a good day with anyone.
	- “Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end. It's not a day when you lounge around doing nothing; it's a day you've had everything to do and you've done it.” Source: Quoted in “As I Said to Denis: The Margaret Thatcher Book of Quotations”
