	- MiniGPT-4 is pretty astonishing: an AI chatbot you can use to ask questions about an image (a feature that's been promised but not yet shipped by GPT-4), building on top of the Vicuna-13B LLM (derived from LLaMA) and BLIP-2 vision-language model https://t.co/07eM64ZIq5

	- They're working on a 7B version of the model. Given vicuna-7b runs in the browser thanks to WebGPU and the Web LLM project, I wouldn't be surprised if it was possible to run a future version of MiniGPT-4 entirely in the browser at some point soon too https://t.co/mBf3Chgjn0 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1647975067941486593))
	- And here's LLaVA - an even more impressive multi-model model, also built on top of LLaMA https://t.co/6YE5t7862G
