- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- 1 - Contemplation of the Sage: Imagine the ideal Sage or exemplary historical figures ([[Socrates]], Diogenes, Cato) and ask yourself: “What would he do?”, or imagine being observed by them and how they would comment on your actions.
	- 2 - Contemplating the Virtues of Other People: Look for examples of virtues among your friends, family, colleagues, etc.
	- 3 - Self-Control Training: Take physical exercise to strengthen self-discipline, practice drinking just water, eat plain food, live modestly, etc.
	- 4 - Contemplating the Whole Cosmos: Imagine the whole universe as if it were one thing and yourself as part of the whole.
	- 5 - The View from Above: Picture events unfolding below as if observed from Mount Olympus or a high  watchtower.
	- 6 - Objective Representation: Describe events to yourself in objective language, without rhetoric or value judgements.
	- 7 - Contemplation of Death: Contemplate your own death regularly, the deaths  of loved ones and even the demise of the universe itself.
	- 8 - Premeditation of Adversity: Mentally rehearse potential losses or misfortunes and view them as “indifferent” (decatastrophising), also view them as natural and inevitable to remove any sense of shock or surprise.
	- 9 - The Financial Metaphor: View your actions as financial transactions and consider whether your behaviour is profitable, e.g., if you sacrifice externals but gain virtue that’s profitable but, by contrast, “What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses himself.”
	- 10 - Accepting Fate (Amor Fati): Rather than seeking for things to be as you will, rather will for things to be as they are, and your life will go smoothly and serenely.
	- 11 - Say to External Things: “It is nothing to me.”
	- 12 - Say Over Loved-Ones: “Tomorrow you will die.”
	- 13 - Cognitive Distancing: Tell yourself it is your judgement that upset you and not the thing itself.
	- 14 - Postponement: Delay responding to things that evoke passion until you have regained your composure.
	- 15 - Picture the Consequences: Imagine what will happen if you act on a desire and compare this to what will happen if you resist it.
	- 16 - Cognitive Distancing: When something upsetting happens to you, imagine how you would view the same thing if it befell someone else and say, “Such things happen in life.”
	- 17 - Empathy: Remember that no man does evil knowingly and when someone does what doesn’t seem right, say to yourself: “It seemed so to him.”
	- 18 - Contemplate the Transience of all Things: When you lose something or someone say “I have given it back” instead of “I have lost it”, and view change as natural and inevitable.
