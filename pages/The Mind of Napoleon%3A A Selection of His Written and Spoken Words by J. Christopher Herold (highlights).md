document_note:: This selection of Napoleon's written and spoken words showcases his extraordinary power of mind, his ability to reduce problems to their simplest elements and his skill at learning and conquering any subject. It provides insight into his views on the human heart, the political order, the art of ruling, law and social order, luck and destiny, revolution, religion, and history. He believed that men are driven by fear and self-interest, that there are only two powers in the world, the power of the sword and the spirit, and that luck is the ability to exploit accidents. He also discussed his own character and how he used it to strengthen his power and deceive those who thought they knew him. He was a master of politics and was able to calculate the advantages of his faults. His words demonstrate his ruthless consistency and ability to apply what he had learned to any problem, and he believed in destiny and the will to live. He also emphasized the importance of reading history, the art of choosing men, and the need for equality and religion in society.
