- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- 1/ Many of the biggest implosions in recent history - especially ecommerce - have been due to startups getting addicted to paid marketing while fooling themselves on Customer Acqusition Costs. As spend scales, it always gets more expensive and harder to track - never less. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993560378129960960))

	- 2/ A familiar story: New product launches. Nice spike, but it dies down. The product is low freq - gotta spend to grow. Marketing spend increases, it's profitable! More is spent, more money is raised via VCs. OMG this is working! Party! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993560907711164416))
	- 3/ Suddenly top line hits a ceiling. Payback period goes from 9 months to 12, then more. Unit economic profitable, but not with staff + HQ. Without top line growth, more investment dollars can't be raised. Budgets get slashed, then layoffs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993561422251659264))
	- 4/ Even slower growth means a pivot is in order. Try something else, also powered by paid marketing. Maybe subscription? Premium? Try another thing. Then another. Irrelevance - or maybe bankrupcy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993561936003584002))
	- 5/ This happens enough that y'all should be nodding your heads now - it's tough, but there's a pattern. This is the Paid Marketing Local Max. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993562448774008832))
	- 6/ The key insight here is that Paid Marketing is tricky to grow, at scale, as the primary channel. It's highly dependent on both against external forces - competition and platform - as well as the [[leadership]] team's [[psychology]] when things get unsustainable.

	- 7/ The first mistake is to start by thinking of everything as Blended CAC - dividing all your acquisition against dollars - as opposed to understanding CAC of each channel (Facebook, Google display, Google AdWords, etc.). The former is misleading. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993563474428088320))
	- 8/ Because your initial organic users are your biggest fans, your Blended CAC and per-channel CAC can often by off by 2-5X. As you scale your paid, your organic won't follow 1:1. So as you grow, your Blended will approach your dominant channel's CAC. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993563986191896581))
	- 9/ Scale effects mostly work against you in paid marketing. The longer your campaigns run, the less effective they become - people start seeing your ads too often. The messaging becomes stale, and novelty effects are real. Market performance has a reversion to the mean. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993564499499257856))
	- 10/ Saturation is also a thing. As you buy up your core demographic, the extra volume comes from non-core, who are less responsive. The first US-based ad impression on a property is the most responsive, but you eventually run out of those. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993565013012107265))
	- 11/ Competitive dynamics are real. They'll come in to copy not just your product, but also ad messaging and creative. It's not hard to fast follow, especially if you can start the test just with a experiments on millennial-friendly ad copy and landing pages. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993565524918448128))
	- 12/ Contrast that to viral channels, folder sharing in Dropbox or team channel creation for Slack - these are highly situational and only a few folks can copy. Whereas in ads you're competing with everyone going after your same demographic. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993566036795457537))
	- 13/ Addiction to paid marketing can get you into a local maximum. It's much harder to fix the underlying issues - creating real moats, product differentiation, doing deeper adtech integrations. Easier to just spend more and push the LTV window from 9 months to 12 to 18. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993566549016489985))
	- 14/ There's a few scenarios where paid marketing is justified, but it's situational. If your product has network effects that kick in after an activation point and really scale, you can use paid to help bootstrap that. Facebook uses paid to build out new regions, for example. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993567059303915520))
	- 15/ If you are really going to invest a ton of time from engineering/growth to integrate with all the APIs, try out a ton of things algorithmically, then you can develop a lasting edge. I've heard Wish does this well, but it's not common. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993567569801039872))
	- 16/ The new generation of ad platforms makes it possible to scale revenue to new heights, but without profitability. Make sure you don't get addicted. Build out there channels. Fix churn and frequency. Don't congratulate yourself too early. And calculate LTV/CAC correctly :) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993568080709259264))
	- 17/ Finally - do you have other lessons on paid marketing and its influence on startup/product strategy? Would love to hear it! And RT if you are enjoying these tweetstorms! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993568593349660672))
