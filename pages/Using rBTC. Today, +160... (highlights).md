	- Using rBTC.
	  
	  Today, +1600 rBTC are locked on RSK, a #Bitcoin sidechain. 
	  
	  This is growing and will grow faster in the coming months / years.
	  
	  rBTC is now super cheap to use, for payments, to trade and use it on DeFi protocols.

	- Costs (and time)
	  
	  The cost of using #rBTC vs #BTC makes it obvious for Bitcoiners to use it on a daily basis (even if you are not using #DeFi)
	  
	  This is especially true as an alternative of using #BTC on #Ethereum.

	- Earn more satoshis holding your BTC
	  
	  You have some tokens like the BPro, which allows a bitcoiner to earn more Satoshis without giving up their PK

	- Current exchanges 
	  
	  rBTC is already listed in Kukoin (where liquidity is low and withdrawal fees are a bit expensive) and @bitfinex (where withdrawal fees are very expensive).

	- I think rBTC will be soon on Binance and the rest of the major exchanges. RBTC is a token that allows today to scale the use of BTC. Binance has already listed $RIF, soon $rBTC?
	  
	  @DECRYPTO_la, Bitso, @krakenfx , @Bitstamp will follow. They are missing an opportunity.

	- Scaling
	  
	  There are already many solutions to bring more scalability to #BTC in #RSK, such as the lumino network.
	  
	  There are some brillant minds working on that, like @SDLerner

	- Lighting Network
	  
	  Of course, for small amounts in #BTC, #LightningNetwork is used and will be used. I would love to see more interoperability between LN and RSK. üîú

	- #BTC will be mainly for Hodling and settlements in the future. Only a large amount transaction will make sense to pay the costs of the fee.
