document_note:: This text explores the idea that advantages such as wealth, power, and health are not always necessary for success, and in fact can often be disadvantages. It suggests that assumed disadvantages, such as learning difficulties or childhood trauma, can spur people to great achievement, and that underdogs can overcome their opponents through indirect, unusual, or deceptive means. It promotes the idea that people must focus on their own unique qualities and maximize their own strengths while avoiding situations more suited to their opponents' strengths, and that society owes a lot to people who take risks and don't care about their reputation. Finally, it suggests that excessive punishments often encourages bad behavior instead of stopping it.
