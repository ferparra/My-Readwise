	- Make good use of your 1:1s to share context, plans, problems, achievements. Drive the discussion.
	  
	  Work in a way that produces things - documents, tickets, PRs, etc. - that can be easily attributed to you and can be referenced later on.

	- Practice talking about nuanced and technical problems you're working on to folks not having the full context.

	- It is easier to play it passive and expect your EM to always be on top of and understand everything you're doing.

	  Realize that you have control over this and help each other.
