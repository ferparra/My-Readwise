	- GPT-4 will change the way that every student learns!
	  
	  Imagine a single lesson being instantly converted into a version for visual learners, logical learners, etc.
	  
	  We built an app that used GPT-4 to do exactly this - without code and in literal seconds.
	  
	  Here's how we did it ðŸ‘‡ðŸ§µ https://t.co/1ewY5mUHd2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/respellai/status/1641199872228433922))

	- To make a spell ( AI-app ), you start by chaining together simple building blocks of AI models, testing and iterating until youâ€™re satisfied. https://t.co/5VZArfQCoH ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/respellai/status/1641199874543702018))
	- In this spell, take a concept and explain it in two different styles - one for logical learners and one for visual learners. We used DALLE-2 to visualize each concept with a prompt crafted by GPT-3. https://t.co/tjaYn08pQo ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/respellai/status/1641199876540071937))
	- When it's ready, publish it to be used instantly on Respell or integrate it into your website/app. You can also make your app public for anybody to use. https://t.co/JPnytHjkEe ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/respellai/status/1641199879430066177))
	- Here's your spell - give it a try, then make your own magic âœ¨  
	  
	  We imagine spells like these being the next step in the AI-enabled future of education. https://t.co/2kAVTWjdOs ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/respellai/status/1641199881518718976))
