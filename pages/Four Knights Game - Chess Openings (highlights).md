	- The Four Knights is a double king pawn opening in which both players develop their knights to ideal squares, pointed towards the center. Formerly considered a bit of a dinosaur, this opening has become somewhat popular again recently; it can lead to either sharp attacks or closed, maneuvering struggles.
	  Pros:
	  
	  Fairly natural play
	  Sound
	  Healthy
	  
	  Cons:
	  
	  Sometimes drawish
	  Could be a closed position, not ideal for 1.e4 players
	  Sometimes overly simplistic
