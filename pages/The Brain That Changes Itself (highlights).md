document_note:: The Brain That Changes Itself by Norman Doidge explores the concept of neuroplasticity, the ability of the brain to rewire itself. It discusses a case of a woman who lost her balance and regained it with the help of a tool called a pons tongue stimulator, as well as how people can learn to use other senses if one is lost. It also covers the importance of early education and good habits, the effects of white noise on infants, the power of acetylcholine on focus and memory, and the effects of pornography, love, and oxytocin on the brain. Furthermore, it delves into the differences in perception between east and west, and how experts use long-term memory to solve problems. Finally, it emphasizes the limitless potential of the human brain to improve with the right stimuli and training.
