	- In the Bayesian school of thought, we condition all our
	  knowledge on what we already know, subjectively.
	- Abandon the frequentist interpretation and its language

	  Ignore the data you didn’t get; focus on the hypotheses you didn’t assume
	  Get used to approximate answers
	  Give up on objectivity; try for validity instead
