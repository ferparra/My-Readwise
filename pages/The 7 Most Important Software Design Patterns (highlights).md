	- The singleton pattern is used to limit creation of a class to only one object.
	- A normal factory produces goods; a software factory produces objects. And not just that â€” it does so without specifying the exact class of the object to be created.
	- This pattern is a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
	- As the name implies, a builder pattern is used to build objects. Sometimes, the objects we create can be complex, made up of several sub-objects or require an elaborate construction process. The exercise of creating complex types can be simplified by using the builder pattern. A composite or an aggregate object is what a builder generally builds.
	- This allows incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into another.
	- The state pattern encapsulates the various states a machine can be in, and allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The machine or the context, as it is called in pattern-speak, can have actions taken on it that propel it into different states.
