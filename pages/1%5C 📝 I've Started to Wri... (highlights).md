	- 1\ 📝 I've started to write "Morning Pages" and it's been transformative for my life and mental health. 
	  
	  I connect more with my emotions, can flow more with my happy and sad moments, and helps me reflect and be more aware.
	  
	  Read this #thread to learn why 👇

	  For those that don't know, a "Morning Page" is just 10 minutes in the morning where I sit down and I do a brain dump
	- 3\ 
	  
	  My personal approach is:
	  
	  * Focus on the weight of my body to connect with my emotions. Write the first thing that comes to find when I feel that emotion. 
	  * Look at my calendar and stop in every event (Call or book myself time). Write how I feel and what's on my mind.

	  * Look out the window to defocus, and write a final thing of what's in my mind
	  
	  It has helped me in multiple ways 👇

	  c) For every activity in the day I learn how I expect I'll feel. The contrast of that with reality gives me awareness and helps me be more content.

	  For example, for a session last week I felt scared, but once I did it I realized it was actually useful and energizing. This made me feel really happy since it was much better than my expectation.

	  It's hard to start since I always want to avoid doing it. Writing about my emotions and thoughts is uncomfortable, but we grow and feel we're alive by doing things that make us feel uncomfortable.
	  
	  Try it!
