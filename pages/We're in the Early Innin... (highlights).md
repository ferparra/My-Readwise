	- We're in the early innings of a metals and mining super cycle. 
	  
	  It's important to develop the analysis/valuation tools now to capture tomorrow's opportunities.
	  
	  Here's a thread on everything you need to know about Valuing Metals and Mining Companies. 
	  
	  Let's get after it ...

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ Motivation For Learning
	  
	  There are a few reasons to learn about valuing mining companies. 
	  
	  First, not all mines are created equal. And not all valuation tools are created equal. 
	  
	  A DCF or earnings-based model doesn't work for exploration companies.
	  
	  You need the right tools!

	- 2/ Metal Classification 
	  
	  Before we can value mining projects, we must understand metallurgy.
	  
	  There are two main metal classes:
	  
	  â€¢ Ferrous: Containing iron
	  
	  â€¢ Non-ferrous: Precious, base, and minor
	  
	  Industrial metals influenced by supply/demand. 
	  
	  Precious driven by sentiment.

	- 3/ Metals-Specific Valuation Factors
	  
	  M&M stocks are driven by two cycles: Commodity prices & Economic growth
	  
	  Valuation greatly depends on where we are in the cycle. You get premium multiples during booms, and bankrupt valuations during bottoms. 
	  
	  There are other factors too ... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/marketplunger1/status/1650889137115787264))
	- A) Volatility
	  
	  Miners also experience far greater price volatility than manufacturers or services. 
	  
	  This means more volatile revenues, profits, and cash flows. 
	  
	  Which means a lower market valuation (investors want predictability!). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/marketplunger1/status/1650889143453614080))
	- B) High Fixed Cost
	  
	  Mining companies need large upfront investments in exploration, equipment, and infrastructure to develop a producing asset. 
	  
	  They must pay these costs regardless of where we are in the cycle because it's expensive to shutdown/reopen. 
	  
	  EBIT can swing wildly.

	- C) Long Lead Times
	  
	  A new mine takes 10-20 years from discovery to production.
	  
	  This opens mining companies to time-sensitive risks in the underlying commodity.
	  
	  What happens when you greenlight a mine at $4/lb copper and coper falls to $3/lb by the time its online? 
	  
	  Very tough!

	- D) Scarcity 
	  
	  We only have so much copper, gold, silver, and graphite to mine on this planet. 
	  
	  That means mining is a finite business with a real end-of-life date. 
	  
	  Companies can delay this by increasing reserve replacement, buying other producers, or mining for new minerals.

	- E) Other Risks 
	  
	  â€¢ Financing risk: Dilutive equity or high-cost debt?
	  
	  â€¢ Permitting Risk: Feasibility
	  
	  â€¢ Geology Risk: Low grades
	  
	  â€¢ Metallurgy Risk: Recoverable quantity
	  
	  â€¢ Country Risk: Politics, taxes, geographic risks, stability, etc. 
	  
	  Country-specific risk premiums ðŸ‘‡

	- 4/ Three Mining Categories
	  
	  There are three main mining company categories:
	  
	  â€¢ Exploration: Don't know if a deposit exists
	  
	  â€¢ Development: Deposit exists, but hasn't been financed or constructed
	  
	  â€¢ Producing: Miner is extracting and selling ore from deposit

	- 5/ Matching Valuation With Category
	  
	  There are three main valuation methods for mining companies: 
	  
	  â€¢ Income/Cash Flow: Earnings-based or DCF model
	  
	  â€¢ Market: Peer transactions
	  
	  â€¢ Cost: Historical cost for asset
	  
	  Here's a great graphic on which method to use for each category!

	- 6/ Inferred, Indicated, and Measured Resources
	  
	  You'll see mining companies boast about their inferred, indicated, and measured minerals.
	  
	  Don't let it intimidate you.
	  
	  Inferred: 10%+ chance its there
	  
	  Indicated: 50%+ chance its there
	  
	  Measured: 90%+ chance its there

	- 7/ The Appraised (or Cost) Method
	  
	  The Appraised (Cost) Approach is best for higher-risk exploration companies as they don't have mineral or cash flow.
	  
	  Value = Sum of all meaningful past exploration expenses and warranted future costs.
	  
	  I.e., how much to recreate exploration?

	- 8/ Comparable Transactions (Market) Valuation
	  
	  Comp valuation is great when there isn't enough information to perform an NPV calculation. 
	  
	  There are many ways to compare various mining projects/companies: 
	  
	  â€¢ Geological resource
	  
	  â€¢ Mineral resreve
	  
	  â€¢ EBIT/EBITDA
	  
	  See below.

	- 9/ Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method
	  
	  The most important factors in DCF are: 
	  
	  â€¢ Discount Rate
	  
	  â€¢ Long-term Commodity Price Assumption
	  
	  Other factors include: 
	  
	  â€¢ Tonnage and grade
	  â€¢ Revenue
	  â€¢ Production costs
	  
	  Let's break down the DCF into its individual factors ... 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fuki_GfWAAEUa6d.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/marketplunger1/status/1650889208540659712))
	- 10/ DCF Factor: Discount Rates
	  
	  I don't want to spend a bunch of time on discount rates, because it's very simple. 
	  
	  There are three inputs: 
	  
	  â€¢ Risk-free rate
	  
	  â€¢ Mining project risk
	  
	  â€¢ Country risk
	  
	  Combine all three risks to get your discount rate. 
	  
	  See below example.

	- 11/ DCF Factor: Mineable Reserves
	  
	  Ore reserve is the fundamental asset which underpins the value of any mining project. 
	  
	  Ore reserve is a function of grades and tonnage. 
	  
	  Lower grades and higher waste tonnage increases costs and reduces revenues, which reduces mine's value. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fuki_3QWcAA0MDm.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/marketplunger1/status/1650889223342284800))
	- 12/ DCF Factor: Revenue 
	  
	  Revenue calculation is simple: 
	  
	  Annual tonnage of ore mined and processed * rate of production * metallurgical recovery of salable commodity * price of commodity.
	  
	  Focus on these three main drivers and ignore the rest for understanding revenues.

	- 13/ DCF Factor: Production Cost
	  
	  There are three main types of costs in mining operations: 
	  
	  â€¢ Operating costs: On-site and off-site 
	  
	  â€¢ Capital Expenditures: Development, construction, engineering, inventories, WC, replacement
	  
	  â€¢ Royalties & Taxes: Financing & gov't tax
