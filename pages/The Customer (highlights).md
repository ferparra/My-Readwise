	- There are five key principles you need to take into account when designing a customer segmentation model:
	  
	  •   Customers within a segment have similar needs
	  •   Customers between segments have meaningful differences in needs
	  •   All segments have a meaningful (i.e. consistent, definable and worth pursuing) number of customers
	  •   The number of segments is manageable within the business – teams within the business can understand and operate with the segmentation
	  •   The segmentation model will enable the business to act differently for each segment, and hence more effectively drive revenues ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhn25eh349q6fvhwnd62dt6))
