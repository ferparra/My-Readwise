	- Hi #datafam, hereâ€™s a sunburst chart I made using Excel. This #viz shows how each economic sector contributed to Nigeriaâ€™s GDP in 2020. Data was obtained from CBN. Here's a thread with instructions on how to create this #viz in Excel.

	- A Sunburst Chart is made up of an inner circle encircled by rings representing higher degrees of hierarchy. Each segment's angle is proportionate to a value or split evenly under its parent node.
	  The sunburst chart is best used for presenting hierarchical data. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DOh_Bams/status/1575944018181005312))
	- Each level of the hierarchy is represented by a single ring or circle, with the innermost circle at the top. A sunburst chart demonstrates how the outer rings link to the inner circles. So, how exactly do we create a sunburst chart in Excel? It's quite simple. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DOh_Bams/status/1575944021239009280))
	- All we need to do now is ensure that our data is formatted correctly. We must organize our table in a hierarchical order from left to right. Imagine the left-most column as the parent column and the ones on the right as the children. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DOh_Bams/status/1575944024619245569))
	- Examine how the data in the table below is organized. Once you have your data in this format, simply highlight all the cells and insert a sunburst chart, and you're done.

	- Here's the data I used for my own #viz. It might look complicated but it follows the same principle. Also,ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… note that for larger hierarchies it's tricky to get the labeling right
