	- The Most Important Sensor to Drive Real Time and Forecast Accuracy
	  
	  Summary:
	  Oceans are vast and we don't have massive networks of cars and roads on oceans to gather that information. To get that information, you need satellites. Most agencies believe weather radar is the most important sensor to drive real time forecast accuracy. Over 5 billion people live outside of radar coverage.

	  So all right, so the problem is you can't get that information of rotions because oceans are vast and we don't have massive networks of cars and roads on oceans to gather that information. So to get that information, you need satellites.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So I would say the following. To help customers make better decisions, you need to give them reliable insights. And to give reliable insights, you have to have reliable and accurate forecast behind it. And I think that over the last few years, what we learned that we're pretty much limited in terms of how much further we can improve the forecast accuracy by the inputs to the models. Because again, as you mentioned, you don't have good enough coverage over the oceans. You don't have many sensors in Latin America, in Africa, in India, in many places in the world. And I would say that the most important, not just me saying that, actually, most of the agencies actually believe that the most important sensor to drive real time and forecast accuracy is weather radar. We all see weather radars daily on TV, on our apps. Radars help us understand where it's raining in real time, how the atmosphere looks like, the cloud's formation and whatnot. And what we learned is that over 5 billion people live outside of radar coverage. And I can go on and on of the consequences of what's happening when you don't have a radar coverage. Now, beyond that, the oceans do not have radar coverage. So every time a really important weather phenomena like tropical storm, like hurricane or cyclone or typhoon is evolving, we don't really have a good grasp of it. So in the US, for example, we fly airplanes, the government flies airplanes over the eye of the storm with a radar, scan it and send it back to the model so we can understand if it's going to be a category one, two or three, and whether we need to evacuate Miami or Tampa. Obviously, it's not as efficient as we want it to be. We want to monitor the hurricane from the inception 24 seven in real time. So, and rest assured, by the way, nobody's flying anything over a typhoon or cyclone in the east. So it's a big, big, big problem. That lack of sensor coverage and specifically radar creates significant issues with weather forecasting and climate resiliency. And that's the problem. The biggest problem we're going after today, and it's part of the entire problem of how do we help customers manage their challenges.
