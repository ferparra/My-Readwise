	- I built my ideal "look great on Zoom/podcasts" setup.
	  
	  It cost some money -- but itâ€™s worth it.
	  
	  Here is how I did it (if you want to copy it): ðŸ§µ

		- **Note**: Thread
	- Some design goals:
	  
	  â€¢ "90% solutions" on these things are great, so I keep it simple
	  â€¢ It needs to be "just turn it on, and it works."
	  â€¢ I want to see people's faces while I look at the camera.
	  â€¢ Cam pointed at my eye level.
	  
	  These are the components (in order of priority): ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/girdley/status/1606277217389985792))
	- 1) USB-C dynamic microphone
	  
	  If you do anything, invest in a dynamic microphone.
	  
	  There are two types:
	  
	  â€¢ Condensers (good at picking up sound in rooms)
	  â€¢ Dynamic (sounds amazing, but you have to stay close)
	  
	  I use a Shure MV7, but any USB-C dynamic is fine.

	- 2) Mic boom arm
	  
	  My mic is mounted to my desk.
	  
	  I use this one from Elgato.
	  
	  But any heavy-duty boom arm does fine.
	  
	  The cheap ones aren't as stable.
	  
	  Elgato is the one I bought.
	  
	  They also have a low-profile version.

	- 3) Camera
	  
	  I have a Sony A6000.
	  
	  This is a mid-range mirrorless camera.
	  
	  1080p (so HD) video with HDMI out.
	  
	  It's a huge improvement over regular webcams.
	  
	  There are other A-series Sonys, too, available now.

	- 4) HDMI-USB adapter
	  
	  This is how my computer uses the Sony A6000 as a webcam.
	  
	  I've tried the fancy adapters (El Gato), but the cheapies are fine.
	  
	  Zoom is usually at 360p, and most pods are 1080p at most, so 4k video isn't useful.

	- 5) Camera Position
	  
	  Below is what I see when on Zoom.
	  
	  There is a:
	  
	  â€¢ teleprompter
	  â€¢ 10.1" monitor screen
	  â€¢ Sony A6000 behind that one-way mirror.
	  
	  On calls, I drag the zoom/pod app to that monitor, which my computer thinks is a regular HDMI monitor.

	- 5a) Teleprompter & components
	  
	  These are the four components.
	  
	  The monitor screen is a bit small for my old eyes.
	  
	  But otherwise works great.

	- 5b) The Teleprompter
	  
	  Here's a quick video of all the pieces put together. https://t.co/y2pTMLud3a ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/girdley/status/1606277439373553664))
	- 6) Camera Lens
	  
	  I used the stock lens for the Sony A6000.
	  
	  But I recently upgraded to a fixed focal lens.
	  
	  It gives:
	  
	  â€¢ better depth of field
	  â€¢ higher performance in low light
	  â€¢ a slight fish-bowl feature to show more of my torso.

	- 6a) The Torso Feel
	  
	  This is by design.
	  
	  The best perspective is if the viewer feels like they're sitting at a table across from me.
	  
	  So, I've pushed to have more of my full torso shown.
	  
	  (Also, I still need to dial in the lighting more. Always a WIP!)

	- 7) Key and Fill Lights
	  
	  I have two panel lights.
	  
	  At 45-degrees from my face.
	  
	  I chose the Elgatos because they can be controlled by software.
	  
	  I have ordered light boxes to diffuse the light better from the panels. Will report back on that.

	- 8) Studio Controller
	  
	  This is from Elgato, too.
	  
	  I programmed the buttons.
	  
	  Then, it's just clicking a button for the on-off of everything. 3 seconds and we are good.
	  
	  It works on Windows and Mac.

	- 9) RGB light strips
	  
	  I used the Elgato's here because the Stream Deck controls them with a single click.
	  
	  They do all colors of the rainbow and rest behind me.
	  
	  It's where the blue comes from here.

	- 10 ) Headphones
	  
	  The Shure MV7 mic has an audio out for headphones.
	  
	  I'm hearing impaired, so I invested in monitor-style headphones.
	  
	  Just plug them into the Shure mic and go from there. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fkqk4-HUEAAmue-.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/girdley/status/1606277521367916546))
	- 11) Shure MV7 Fanciness
	  
	  The MV7 has one frustration.
	  
	  Great mic, but they have a crappy thin foam pop filter.
	  
	  One trick: you can buy an aftermarket one to look like Joe Rogan.

	- 12) Phillips Hue
	  
	  The Elgato stream deck can control the Phillips Hue line of RGB lighting.
	  
	  So one button and I get any color of the rainbow behind me.
	  
	  It requires a bridge to work with the Elgato software.

	- 13) Cable management
	  
	  @michaelpatron0 pointed out my cable management looked like crap.
	  
	  So, I bought this.
	  
	  It looks 100x better with everything hidden below the desk now.

	- OK, that's my setup.
	  
	  I'm sure I'll get 100 A/V guys suggesting improvements, please do!

	- I took some feedback from @EdSillars and it really improved it.
	  
	  Lowered my lights and moved them to compensate for the natural light from my window.
	  
	  May need to move the key light a little to the right still.
