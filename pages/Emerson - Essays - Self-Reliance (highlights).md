	- There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction
	  that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself
	  for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is
	  full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through
	  his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till.

	  contemporaries, the connection of events.
