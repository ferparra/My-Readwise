	- The MakerDAO protocol minted the DAI stablecoin asset, which acts as a hedging tool and medium of exchange directly on-chain.
	- The cornerstone of DeFi is overcollateralization–always having more collateral than assets minted–which means that there is always room for incentivization of a third party to pay back debt on behalf of borrowers, keepers being repaid and retributed by borrowers collateral through an action mechanism.
	- The D3M is an exploration of an alternative path to bring more liquidity in secondary DAI venues by minting DAI backed by aDAI and depositing it directly in secondary markets to release liquidity shortage pressures.
	- The D3M module is a potential new tool for the MakerDAO to stabilize DAI peg, increase DAI attractiveness for borrowers and create new pathways of revenues for the MKR ecosystem.
	- aDAI is an automatically-generated, native token to the Aave protocol, which is issued to a user who supplies DAI into the Aave protocol. aDAI is astandard ERC-20 token, which is natively balance-increasing such that the DAI pool on the Aave protocol generates interest to all suppliers to the DAI pool. he aDAI smart-contract continuously updates the balance of all aDAI token holders (including D3M Vault) to reflect this accrual by increasing their aDAI balance.
