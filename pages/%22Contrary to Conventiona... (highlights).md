	- "Contrary to conventional wisdom, human brilliance emerges not from our innate brainpower or raw computational capacities, but from the sharing  of information in communities and networks over generations." A false dichotomy.

	- I think that passages like this involve strawmanning imagined opponents and asking questions ("what makes us smart?"; see also "what is the secret of our success?") that are so nebulous and ill-defined that they couldn't have scientific answers.

	- Nobody (including Pinker) disagrees with the trivial claim that individual-level creativity, innovation, rationality, etc., are not *sufficient* for making rockets, composing symphonies, developing scientific theories, etc. The claim is that they are necessary.

	- To the extent that researchers in social psychology and behavioural economics portray individual human beings as "compete morons" riddled with irrationalities, the researchers are simply radically mistaken.

	- I would quibble with the wording at points (e.g., the phrase "cultural evolutionary incentives") and think some of what's being expressed is too vague, but I agree with all of these - and would note that they are not unique insights of this brand of cultural evolutionary theory.

	- There is lots that is valuable here. It is good to appreciate the importance of culture, history, institutions, incentives, etc, which are often overlooked. But the framework similarly overlooks the extent to which humans are highly sophisticated, strategic, rational agents. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danwilliamsphil/status/1650175018435747847))
