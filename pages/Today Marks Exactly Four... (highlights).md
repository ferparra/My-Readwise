	- Spotify became publicly traded on April 3, 2018, via a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange. 
	  
	  At that time, Spotify's LTM sales were roughly €4B. And sales kept growing rapidly. 
	  
	  This chart needs no explanation, look at that continuous revenue growth!

	- So, why hasn't the stock price kept up? 
	  
	  Well, Spotify is STILL unprofitable. Much of their revenues are sucked into the record labels' pockets, who own the rights to the music.
	  
	  Without a handful of top artists, Spotify becomes useless. So the labels have some leverage 💪🏼. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PersianCapital/status/1510629279855378436))
	- And companies are not valued on their revenue, nor on their revenue growth. But rather on how much CASH its shareholders expect to TAKE OUT of the business. 
	  
	  More simply:
	  
	  👉🏽 It doesn't matter how much revenue a company has if none of it will ever be paid out as dividends. 👈🏽 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PersianCapital/status/1510629282824945667))
	- Furthermore, investors have put a lower multiple on Spotify's sales. At the time of their IPO, investors were willing to pay ~4x P/S. Now, that has decreased to ~2.6x.
	  
	  Multiple compression is a bitch 💀.

	- Lastly some positive words: As a user, I love Spotify. I've used it for 10 yrs, long before it was officially available in the Netherlands. 
	  
	  And I like Daniel Ek (co-founder). I wish every billionaire was as humble and down to earth as he is 🙌🏽. 
	  
	  That's it. Have a good day! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PersianCapital/status/1510629292035563525))
