	- Problem: You want to reset React state when a componentâ€™s props change.
	  
	  Solution: Change the componentâ€™s key when the props change. 
	  
	  When the key changes, React deletes the old component. It creates a new instance that uses the default state.
	  
	  No useEffect required. ðŸ˜Ž

	- Two more points:
	  
	  1. Why not use useEffect? Because resetting state via useEffect is error prone. As new state is added, someone may forget to update the useEffect call.
	  
	  2. Warning: If the component tree is expensive to render, consider resetting state via useEffect instead. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1652695129289785345))
	- @gimenete And itâ€™s a tradeoff, so agree can be a tough call: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1652724623077699586))
	- Problem: "I don't like setting the key in the parent. It's not discoverable, has to be implemented in each usage, and breaks "encapsulation".  
	  
	  Solution: Wrap the component so it manages its own key. Do this in the component's file, and only export the wrapper.  Problem solved.
