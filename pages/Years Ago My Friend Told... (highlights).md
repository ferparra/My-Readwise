	- years ago my friend told me about Ring Theory, it helped me to be better at taking care of people in crisis
	  
	  I've never heard it discussed since then, so I'll write up my understanding here bc I think it could be useful ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RichDecibels/status/1626127231457062913))

	- person X is in distress. they're in the inner circle, surrounded by concentric rings of people. first ring could be their spouse. second ring, siblings or close friends. third ring, acquaintances, friends of friends etc ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RichDecibels/status/1626127655450906625))
	- visualising these rings gives you a model for  how to metabolise distress & other intense feelings
	  
	  the person in Crisis gets to thrash about and vent and dump their bad feelings out to the first ring. no holds barred, anything goes ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RichDecibels/status/1626128065616138242))
	- the job of the first ring is to be superhumanly understanding, comforting, forgiving, patient, kind to the person in distress
	  
	  but they're accumulating resentment / bad feelings in the process, which they can export to the second ring ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RichDecibels/status/1626128454524497922))
	- bad feelings is exported outwards in expanding rings of diminishing intensity
	  
	  comfort is imported in to the smaller rings in increasing intensity ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RichDecibels/status/1626128634913120257))
	- if there are enough connections in the social fabric and rough alignment on this import/export model, very intense feelings can be metabolised by the network, like dropping a bowling ball on a trampoline ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RichDecibels/status/1626129239459209217))
	- if there are not enough social connections, or not enough alignment about what to do with bad feelings, the intense distress can overwhelm the network capacity: extreme distress ruptures relatedness ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RichDecibels/status/1626129342840414210))
	- I looked it up, Ring Theory was coined by psychologist Dr. Susan Silk: https://t.co/jy99fvRZV4
	  
	  "Each person in the diagram is advised to 'comfort in, dump out', which Silk calls the 'kvetching order'." ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

	- by the way I think this is a useful way to think about accelerating political polarisation
	  
	  problem: extreme distress ruptures relatedness
	  solution: more connections + more skills of mutual care ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RichDecibels/status/1626130717427081217))
