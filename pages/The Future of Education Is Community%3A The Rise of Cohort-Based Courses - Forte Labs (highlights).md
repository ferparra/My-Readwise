	- Known as “Cohort-Based Courses,” or CBCs, this is the first truly Internet-native form of learning. It is the first to tap into the essential nature of the Internet: that it is open-ended and interactive.
	- Some cohort-based programs (such as Marie Forleo’s B School) embraced the “flipped classroom” model, where pre-recorded content is consumed on students’ own time, and the live classroom is reserved for things that can only happen in real time, like coaching, interacting, asking questions, and sharing breakthroughs.
	- Cohorts can now come together from dozens of countries, meet any time of the day or night, focus on niche topics that relatively few people are interested in, and adapt the curriculum on the fly. Everything is virtual and digital, which means it is malleable.
	- The intensive environment of a cohort is like a pressure cooker for friendships – they can happen in a fraction of the usual time. And not just friendships, but all kinds of relationships: students find mentors, collaborators, thought partners, coaches, advisors, and even clients, employers, or romantic partners.
	- True accountability comes from being in relationship. It is the relationships we value which prompt us to show up for our soccer team, come prepared to the meeting, or make it to our friend’s birthday party after work. Those relationships can only be formed through direct, meaningful interaction with people we respect.
	- The learning experience that is emerging resembles a video game or a virtual world as much as it does a university classroom.
