document_note:: Robert Pirsig's "On Quality: An Inquiry Into Excellence" is a collection of his writings related to the concept of quality. He emphasizes that one's ability to recognize quality is more important than one's ability to create it, and that ultimately, the pursuit of excellence is an enlightenment. Pirsig also suggests that quality is self-evident, and that it is a duty to oneself and to quality. He suggests that Zen meditation is the best route to discovery quality, and offers advice to students to recognize quality before attempting to explain it.
