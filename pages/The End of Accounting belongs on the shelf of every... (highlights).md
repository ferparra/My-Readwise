document_note:: The book 'The End of Accounting' discusses why the usefulness of financial information in investors' decisions is at an all-time low and how to fix it. It highlights several charts demonstrating the decline in the relevance of corporate financial information to investors and bifurcates each factor (earnings and book value) to determine the insignificance of each bit of corporate financial information. It also states that financial accounting reports contribute only 5% to an investor's final decision-making process. The book identifies three main culprits for Accounting's Irrelevance: Treatment of Intangible Assets, Substituting Estimates For Facts and Unrecorded Events That Affect Corporate Value. It suggests Strategic Resources & Consequences Reports as a potential solution.
