	- “‘Rachel’ started taking puberty blockers at 14... testosterone shortly after…  breasts removed at 16… womb removed at 18… By age 22, she was ‘swamped by regret’… ‘With time I could have lived happily as a masculine lesbian woman.’”

	- “I was prescribed testosterone in 2010... My doctors did not do a fulsome screening of me for other mental health diagnoses or developmental disabilities. In 2012 I paid to have my breasts removed….What happened to me should never happen again”

	- “Imagine there was a sudden 4,000% increase in teens identifying as amputees…Such a world would obviously be mad, yet our reality is far worse. Teens are being allowed to sacrifice their health, fertility, and future chance of intimacy”

	- We are living through the greatest medical scandal since the sterilization of the mentally ill 100 years ago. Children with treatable psychiatric conditions, autism spectrum disorder, and other developmental challenges are vulnerable. So too are gay kids. It’s time to speak out.

	- The radical trans movement is a violent and dangerous cult that preys on children and attacks their primary defenders, women. It deceived us by wrapping itself in the language of compassion and liberation. It’s led by fanatics and enabled by cowards.
