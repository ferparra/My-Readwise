	- It‚Äôs not a secret that i‚Äôm omega bullish on $ETH so I wanted to share a few good yield sources that I consider safe
	  
	  Some of the coolest high-yield tricks atm involve leveraging up on interest-bearing $ETH tokens (e.g $stETH) üëá ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/litocoen/status/1507348674459938829))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- This works because borrowing rates for $ETH across DeFi lending protocols are much lower than the interest gained by staking.
	  
	  The Ethereum Max Yield Index (aka $ETHMAXY) achieves exactly that.

	- It is composed of stETH, deposited as collateral, allowing ETH to be borrowed and wrapped into stETH - this process is repeated until the token is 3x levered.
	  
	  As a user you don‚Äôt have to manage any of this, you just buy the token and leverage is managed by @galleonDAO. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/litocoen/status/1507348682714320905))
	- PROS: Easy to use, one click exposure
	  
	  CONS: 2% streaming fee, 10% quotes apr seems wrong it's probably a bit lower
	  
	  BONUS: You can LP $ETHMAXY/$ETH and earn 10% additional yield in $GBL and $DRINK gov tokens but be aware that his may fluctuate based on their respective prices ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/litocoen/status/1507348684626968576))
	- Another way to achieve this leverage is by using @Instadapp‚Äôs smart contract wallet.
	  
	  It works exactly the same way, the only difference is that here you manage your position yourself.
	  
	  Instadapp simply allows you to bundle multiple txs in one using Flashloans.

	- Deposit $stETH -> borrow $ETH -> sell for $stETH on @CurveFinance, deposit more $stETH etc.
	  
	  You get to a 4x leveraged position at 8.7% APR.
	  
	  PRO's: higher leverage, no streaming fees to "managers"
	  
	  CONS: high gas cost bc it involves many tx's & having a Instadapp smart wallet ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/litocoen/status/1507348692902236167))
	- TLDR: It only makes sense for a position of $100k +
	  
	  One option I really like as it is üç§-friendly is @argentHQ's L2 wallet where you can zap into its Yield Optimized Yearn vault with any token and get 7%
	  
	  Yearn LP's on $stETH/ETH on Curve and auto-sells $CRV rewards into  $ETH

	- PROS: Insanely easy UX on mobile, fiat on-ramp with @RampNetwork 
	  
	  CONS: Being picky here not a big con but theres no easy way to off-ramp $ETH from L2 account (yet), if you want to exit your position you need to bridge back to L1 and then to CEX and pay some additional fees ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/litocoen/status/1507348700485591042))
	- Then there's @stakewise another staking platform.
	  
	  I like Stakewise because they are the only ones using a dual token model allowing you to re-invest your staking rewards ($rETH2) into $sETH2 and hence compound your yield.

	- Stake $ETH and then provide liquidity on $sETH2/$ETH and earn 9% APR from staking rewards + trading fees + $SWISE gov token incentives.
	  
	  As mentioned, you can manually re-invest your $rETH2 into more $sETH2 and increase your LP position incrementally üîÑ

	- PROS: Increase staking pool diversity, good APR
	  
	  CONS: Setting UniV3 LP range can be intimating for some users but it's actually quite easy! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/litocoen/status/1507348712577769482))
	- It wouldn't be a real twitter thread if I wouldn't shill my own project somewhere so go check out the @hopprotocol $ETH pools on @0xpolygon and @gnosischain where you earn over 7% of $GNO and $MATIC incentives + trading fees.
	  
	  PROS: best bridge in the world
	  
	  CONS: none

	- Lastly there's also the $rETH -$wstETH pool on @curvefinance where you earn staking rewards on both tokens & $CRV
	  
	  rETH is the staking token of @Rocket_Pool and $wstETH is @LidoFinance 
	  
	  easiest & most profitable way to access is via Yearn üëá

	- Waiting for a few good options on L2 so that I can shill it to people with smaller budgets
	  
	  @argentHQ excels for that reasons
	  
	  @PolynomialFi structured product vaults on @optimismPBC coming in a week will be sweet as well
	  
	  any good $ETH yields on L2 pls ping me ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/litocoen/status/1507349869572374533))
	- a really good one is actually @GMX_IO but you're exposed to multiple tokens not just $ETH
	  
	  it's an index of assets, technically an LP token that provides liquidity on the platform for all the perp trades
	  
	  it earns 70% of the platform revenues + escrowed $GMX rewards
	  
	  40% apr

	- ps: another app i really like to managed leveraged positions on Aave, Maker etc. is @DeFiSaver 
	  
	  Like Instdapp you also have to deploy a Smart contact wallet but it uses the DSProxy standard developed by MakerDAO meaning you can manage it in other user interfaces
