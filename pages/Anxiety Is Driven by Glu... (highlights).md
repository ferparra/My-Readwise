	- Anxiety is driven by glutamate, adrenaline, cortisol, reduced or relieved by GABA and serotonin. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1381640511136493572))

	- Magnesium glycinate, l-theanine, and/or inositol under the tongue.
	  
	  SOAK back of head and neck liberally with magnesium chloride water to disengage stress/anxiety biochemistry similarly to the pharmacological actions of benzodiazepines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1381640512461934597))
	- Nutritional deficiencies are also the primary driver for anxiety, aside from the obvious trauma exposure. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1381640687486033931))
	- I’ve had people compare the efficacy of anxiolysis they experience with the magnesium glycinate and l-theanine sublingual combination to Clonazepam (Klonopin) without side effects or dependency. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1381640688601767936))
	- Ironically, pranayama/breathwork or meditation DIRECTLY reduces this biochemistry.
	  
	  When people say it “doesn’t help”, this indicates glutamate/adrenaline/cortisol too high to manage in this state on their own. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1381640983826157569))
	- Not that they’re “doing it wrong”, but their biochemistry prevents them from shifting it without support. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1381640985092878336))
	- [[Anxiety]] really is one of the easier states to relieve altogether.
	  
	  It’s a shame people either get stuck in [[victim mentality]] or doctors tell them there is no hope outside of addictive medications. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1381640986397315074))
	- Now, take this actionable advice and thrive potentially for the very first time in your life. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1381640987676614656))
