	- Context gives us a sense of purpose and reason.

	- Friendship and camaraderie. I’ve been lucky to find close friends alongside whom I’ve weathered a number of life’s storms; people I can both confide in and FaceTime without prior warning without it being weird.

	- Friendship, love and community are all meaningful. They do make me feel more rooted in the world around me. They do make me feel less lonely.

	- It’s when you wish you could talk to someone, but as you scroll through your phone looking for the right person to call, no one feels particularly right for whatever reason; wishing to feel connected but just not wanting to do the whole connecting thing.

	- A brief or close encounter with the silence of our own thoughts can feel like jumping into the deep end of a pool before ever learning how to swim. We almost reflexively squirm and scramble, reaching for something, anything, more familiar, more predictable, more in our control.

	- It’s common for there to be a gap between who we think we are and who we actually are. Closing that gap can be scary, especially as the stories we tell ourselves grow cemented over time. In my case, I’ve clearly grown to think I’m a better listener than I appear to be.

	- The truth is that in many ways, we are strangers to ourselves.

	- The way Tea With Strangers conversations work is simple: A host in our community puts a time and a place up on our website. 5 strangers sign up. Nobody knows anybody who’s going to show up. Nobody knows what they’re going to talk about. They meet at a cafe. They talk for 2 hours. The host helps facilitate and guide the conversation as needed.

	- Asking one seemingly uncomfortable question raises the bar for what’s awkward. It’s not long before everyone at the table is asking follow up questions, paying attention to what each person has to say. Making eye contact! Even listening enough to not constantly think about what you’re going to say next while someone else is talking.

	- You don’t really know what’s going on. You have no idea what the person is going through, and there’s probably a ton of assumptions you’ve baked into your interpretation of the situation that might be challenged if you sat with the person and heard their story. They are probably doing their best with the card they were dealt in this moment, and it’s likely that they are no “worse” or “better” than you are.
	- As you notice the reality that you don’t know everything about others, you might wonder what you don’t know about yourself.

	- In order to grow curious with yourself and listen to what you might find, you need space to step outside of yourself. Giving your [[consciousness]] breathing room—time, non-judgment, quietude—can yield its own kind of shared humanity: Self Awareness.

	- For me, practice is going on long walks in nature—long enough to forget what I was thinking about before I started—and instead marvel at how many shades of green there are.
	- And when I’m not quite prepared to face my own thoughts, it’s bringing a book to the living room and getting sucked into a story so deep that I forget my phone is in the bedroom—which, of course, requires me to leave my phone in the bedroom in the first place.

	- You stop worrying so much about what other people think and trade that in for enjoying the process of becoming who you are.
	- When you recognize how complicated you are, you give other people a bit of a break and accept them for being complicated in their own ways
	- In the past, you might have wanted to be where everyone else is, but instead, you feel oddly comfortable in your own company.
