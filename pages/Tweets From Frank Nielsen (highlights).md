	- Book #otd "Mathematics for machine learning" (CUP, 2020).
	  Free PDF from https://t.co/sUwX7N3VJI ðŸ˜Š
	  A must-read masterpiece, nicely structured and richly 
	   color-illustrated book  by @mpd37 @AnalogAldo @ChengSoonOng

	- Calling tensor  a multidimensional array is often an unfortunate misnaming in machine learning!
	  â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“
	  In geometry,  a tensor is an *intrinsic object* whose *components* obey either a *covariant/contravariant rule* under *changes of basis*

	- I like this textbook very much (MSc & PhD 1st year level). It does a great job to convey traditional statistics in 70 pages before engaging the reader into methods that were made possible by the "computer age" (eg, Random forests, boosting, Lasso, NNs). 
	  Nicely+concisely written!
