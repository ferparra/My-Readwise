	- Calling tensor  a multidimensional array is often an unfortunate misnaming in machine learning!
	  â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“
	  In geometry,  a tensor is an *intrinsic object* whose *components* obey either a *covariant/contravariant rule* under *changes of basis*

	- I like this textbook very much (MSc & PhD 1st year level). It does a great job to convey traditional statistics in 70 pages before engaging the reader into methods that were made possible by the "computer age" (eg, Random forests, boosting, Lasso, NNs). 
	  Nicely+concisely written!

	- Symmetry is a fundamental concept in science and art related to groups and group actions.
	   â†’ selected books presenting symmetry under various angles, from popular viewpoints to advanced mathematical theories with applications in mechanics, physics, machine learning and AI, etc.

	- An excellent *concise* book to get an introduction to *topological data analysis* (TDA) with homology and Morse theory

	- Engrossed in reading of "Journey to the edge of reason: The life of Kurt Godel". Godel (PhD at 23 yo) is famous for his incompleteness theorem (published at 25 yo):  "no formal math system captures every math truth within its own bounds". Tormented life

	- Nicely written book covering many concepts and structures.
	  Very useful & worth checking!
	  "Mathematics translates concepts into formalisms and applies those formalisms to derive insights*that are usually not amenable to a less formal analysis."
	- Minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence can be interpreted as an information projection wrt to Fisher orthogonality and exponential or mixture connection.
	  Uniqueness of projection proof may be proved with a generalization of the Pythagoras' theorem!
