	- Recently chatted with multiple PMs who are facing common pain points.
	  
	  1. Mgr expects the PM to do everything
	  2. Eng estimates are inaccurate
	  3. Mgr helicopters in and makes sudden changes
	  4. No culture of accountability
	  5. No EM to manage engineers
	  
	  How I approach these: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1579539778382331904))

	- 1. Expecting PMs to do everything
	  
	  PMs should roll their sleeves up, but these should be short term stop gaps. Stop the bleeding then hand it back to the right owner.
	  
	  Map out where you can be highest leverage and make it clear that's where your time is best spent. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1579539780945125376))
	- 2. Inaccurate eng estimates
	  
	  Some eng don't bake in enough time while others sandbag.
	  
	  Hold eng accountable to their estimates so they know to be accurate. Push them on how long tasks should take. If you don't know, get up to speed + check with someone. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1579539783570796549))
	- 3. Mgr helicoptering
	  
	  This is the worst. If you feel comfortable, talk to your mgr 1:1.
	  
	  Ask how you can provide more context along the way (in weekly 1:1s, weekly email, looping them into PRDs) to minimize thrash. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1579539786116710400))
	- 4. No culture of accountability
	  
	  This comes from the top. The founders should have clear milestones and timelines should be clear across the board.
	  
	  As a PM, you enforce & build your timelines in.
	  
	  If no one is held accountable from the top down then this is a lost cause. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1579539788717170688))
	- 5. No EM to manage engineers
	  
	  This is common at early startups. Unless explicit, the job of a PM isn't to be an EM. Instead of managing every individual eng, I like to lean on a sr eng/tech lead in those situations.
	  
	  They can delegate tasks to the team & hold them accountable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1579539791393136640))
