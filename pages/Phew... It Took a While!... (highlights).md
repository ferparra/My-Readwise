	- Phew... it took a while! But our 3D editor for THREE.js is finally out üòá
	  
	  It helps you tweak #r3f scenes, place #threejs objects around, and animate them.
	  
	  Here is how it works üßµüëá https://t.co/jzFS2jdql8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ariaminaei/status/1570393233997582336))

	- The 3D editor is an extension of @theatre_js made for React Three Fiber. You basically mark your THREE.js objects, and they show up in the 3D editor (video in the next tweet).

	- Once an object is marked, it shows up in the snapshot editor, so you can select it/tweak it/move it around. The snapshot editor is frozen, so active objects don't have to be "chased"  Here is an example of placing a camera to get a perfect shot. https://t.co/Sg5rL1iAeH ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ariaminaei/status/1570393313622233090))
	- Known THREE.js objects come with default bindings. E.g. a fog has a color and a near/far field. Cameras have zoom/FOV, and lights have intensity. https://t.co/hggPKAZlKr ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ariaminaei/status/1570393366927675393))
	- And since it's all Theatre.js, everything is animatable!
	  
	  Speaking of animation, the keyframing flow has a big upgrade too. For starters, keyframes now aggregate to their parent prop, helping you choreograph complex sequences. https://t.co/sLjUNCrnSf ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ariaminaei/status/1570393394287120384))
	- It used to be that the only sequenceable type was numbers. Now, all types are sequencable!
	  
	  And yes, @akella, that includes the color prop üòâ https://t.co/F1zFm0W7Wd ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ariaminaei/status/1570393413996146688))
	- Keyframes can now be edited inline, saving you a few seconds on each edit. https://t.co/RxFTKHpuz9 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ariaminaei/status/1570393441271713798))
	- If you are animating a long sequence, you may want to focus playback on a short range until you get it right. The new focus range makes that easy. https://t.co/hEoTYZ2rgo ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ariaminaei/status/1570393477921542151))
	- And as is always the case, everything snaps! https://t.co/YUbOrHqYPu ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ariaminaei/status/1570393520070074370))
	- Blocking out sequences has also gotten much faster. The new tween editor helps you edit several easings at once, so it's easy to make different movements match up now. https://t.co/Od2jIXUP8E ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ariaminaei/status/1570393544782909441))
	- The popular easing presets are also there, so you can define the contours of your animation, and leave the details for later. https://t.co/QPPIB0iscl ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ariaminaei/status/1570393566765273089))
	- And for power users, the fuzzy matcher helps you pick a preset in two seconds! https://t.co/ky8xQv3RQ5 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ariaminaei/status/1570393584029007876))
