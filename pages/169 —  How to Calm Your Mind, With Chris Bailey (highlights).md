	- Dopamine Is More Than Just a Pleasure Chemical
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Dopamine is more than just the pleasure chemical., * Dopamine drives a lot of our biological functions., * Dopamine helps us think logically and creatively., * When we hunker down and focus on something with intensity, dopamine propels that behavior in a really other neurochemicals do as well, like oxytocin and serotonin.)

	  Yeah, so let's unpack that a little bit further because dopamine is more than just the pleasure chemical. This was one of the big things I got from this book. And that's kind of how I defined it previously. But it has more to do with the anticipation than the actual pleasure. You mind diving into that a little bit?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, for sure. So, you know, dopamine, this is something that I misunderstood as well going into writing this book, is looking at the actual research on this neurochemical. I realized just how misunderstood dopamine is, including by myself at the time. I thought of it as a pleasure chemical and thought, okay, of course, we're propelled towards pleasure with dopamine whenever we distract ourselves or something like that. But it is far more complex than that. Dopamine drives a lot of our biological functions. It helps our body continue moving and beating. It helps us think logically. It helps us think creatively. When we hunker down and focus on something with intensity, dopamine propels that behavior in a really other neurochemicals do as well, like oxytocin and serotonin, where we feel connected and proud with what we're doing and endorphins as well when we feel a sense of rush behind what we're doing, like during a workout, for example. But dopamine is this complex chemical that drives so much of the good things in our life as well, this creative, productive work. But it does kind of have a darker side that is more worth illuminating as it relates to two ideas. And those ideas are stimulation and acquisition, accomplishment. And so, you know, we just covered the first one. The more we're driven to acquire more, the more we're propelled by dopamine because we activate this acquisition network of our brain. And the fascinating thing about this acquisition network is there's kind of too, not to nerd out too much, but I feel focused. No, let's do it.
