	- Profit Well starts off with some notes that brands that use these tactics see 2x CLTV, 2x AOV, and 3x higher growth rate.
	  
	  The companies featured in season 2 include Fresh Clean Tees, Dollar Shave Club, Boxed Water, Bulletproof, Bouqs, Ritual, Art of Sport, Soylent, and Lovepop ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jsappington/status/1408176241148977154))
	- They see 3 categories that affect your subscription program.
	  
	  1. Active churn  - Customers who are actively trying to cancel your product
	  2. Expansion revenue - Existing customers buying more product
	  3. Credit card failure - Delinquent or involuntarily churn. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jsappington/status/1408176242206068747))
	- I'm going to go 1 by 1 each category and include the notes I took for them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jsappington/status/1408176243493818370))
	- First off, how you can reduce active churn...

	- Customers who have already purchased from you are much more likely to purchase more, take advantage of that.
	- Expansion revenue cont/

	- Send out 4-5 emails over a 14 day drip with 1-2 sms nudges
	- Automatically retry customers card at 4-5 times at key dates where someone is likely to have just gotten paid (12:01 pst the 1st and 15th of the month)
	- That's all I had! This was a great series (thanks for putting it together @Patticus + PW team)
	  
	  Going to start writing out how we can use this for @bambuearth and @SlickProduct right away. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jsappington/status/1408176251077005313))
