	- I had fun giving this talk in @chipro 's ML Systems Class @Stanford about a subject we don't talk about enough:
	  
	  1. How to evaluate ML Tooling
	  2. How to spot & deal with ðŸ”¥Tool Zealots ðŸ”¥
	  
	  We have recorded the full talk ðŸ‘‡

	  Also a ðŸ§µðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1489269947108769795))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- We have all encountered tool zealots
	  
	  Things that have been said to me:
	- It can be hard to resist Zealots, especially when you are new.  They often appeal to authority and try to make you feel inferior if you do not use their tools with cherry-picked features

	- These are some criteria that can be helpful for evaluating tools that I discuss in the talk using TensorFlow Extended as an example

	- I discuss important things like adding friction into critical aspects of the workflow

	- The importance of being able to iterate fast

	- The danger of having too much complexity up-front

	- New DSLs and confusing config files that add cognitive load for simple things like data visualization

	- I also discuss how myopic focus tools can lead to large blind spots in how you solve certain ML problems

	- The most important consideration when selecting tools: 
	  
	  âœ¨Quality of the documentation âœ¨

	- API design is important:  tools should not force you to incur cognitive load with tons of boilerplate or unintuitive syntax

	- BUT WAIT!  There are counter-arguments zealots will often use.  I outline the most common ones.  
	  
	  The First one: "We need to scale"
	  
	  Unnecessary focus on scaling  is destructive, especially in the presence of reasonable alternatives that work well for many people 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FKrujHiVkAQB6Kd.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1489269994688897029))
	- The second one:
	  
	   "You can prototype with your own tools, but only refactor when you are ready for production"
	  
	  The slide speaks for itself 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FKrvSdnUUAAgqR-.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1489269999067820033))
	- The third one:
	  
	  "If you use {favorite cloud provider}, it is not that bad!"
	  
	  I think this is a dangerous career strategy 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FKrveYHVgAQThcg.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1489270003568234496))
	- The most egregious argument zealots provide is an appeal to authority.  
	  
	  Zealots often do this because they do not have principled arguments and are not informed.  It is important to shut this argument down if **all you hear** is an appeal to authority

	- One thing I hope people will take away from this talk: 
	  
	  Don't Become A Zealot!!!
	  
	  I outline why

	- Just to be clear, I do not hate TFX.  In the talk, I talk about some parts of TFX that I really love.  It's not a binary love vs. hate thing.
	  
	  If you want to know what those are, watch the talk!
