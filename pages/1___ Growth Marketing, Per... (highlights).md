	- 1/ Growth marketing, performance, acquisition, media buying... where does one start and the next start? 
	  
	  I get this question quite a bit (most recently from my friends @reforge and @lennysan's slack group). So I thought I'd share my take here!

	- 2/ Media Buying
	  
	  I start here, knowing full well that this title is almost exclusively used on the agency side, and not in tech or consumer "in-house" titles these days. But this is actually what most of these roles tend to be hiring for.

	- 3/ Growth Marketing
	  
	  The "sexiest" title on the market, so is over-used. True growth marketing covers a much broader territory to do what growth does well. 
	  
	  The demand-gen (think awareness/consideration) exclusion here tends to be the goal of the role. Not what's possible.

	- 4/ Acquisition Marketing
	  
	  The most narrow slice. It tends to just be focused on the purchase point and too narrowly defines what these roles actually do.

	- 5/ Performance Marketing
	  
	  This is probably the purest alignment on what most companies are actually hiring for, and what the job ends up actually having influence over.

	- 6/ Channel Marketing
	  
	  This is what I think most performance marketers should own, but the goals they have or the internal perception they have are too narrow to allow it. But they own the platform, they should own all roles it can play.

	- 7/ Lifecycle Marketing
	  
	  While not usually confused with the above mix, it definitely has overlap, and often the same person/team is expected to carry the lifecycle torch.

	- 8/ The truth?
	  
	  The titles I've had -> Media associate, Media buyer, media strategist, mobile marketing, marketing, performance marketing, growth marketing, marketing innovation, growth, performance and lifecycle. 
	  
	  And my jobs have never met any of these molds perfectly ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AKGrenier/status/1451615776348147716))
	- 9/ Thoughts?
	  
	  I fully recognize literally no one's job or JD fits any of these molds perfectly. So don't overthink it. But please use this as a foundation and poke holes. I'd still love your thoughts - where am I off? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AKGrenier/status/1451615777367359493))
