	- Imagine an AI model that's 3x larger and more powerful than GPT3 aka ChatGPT
	  
	  Google already built that in April, called PaLM, on their own TPU hardware competing with NVIDIA. People think ChatGPT will replace Google but they basically invented transformers in '17 (the T in GPT)

		- **Note**: Thread
	- Google's been using a transformer model called BERT billions of times a day for years, it powers their search, email, and probably lots more, but it's invisible to users
	  
	  Google Assistant will suddenly outperform ChatGPT one day when Google flips the switch for a system like PaLM ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sterlingcrispin/status/1606064294663069696))
	- PaLM stands for "Pathways Language Model." Google Pathyways is an ML system that can scale a model across tens of thousands of their proprietary TPU chips. Eventually they'll have a massive multimodal model across vision, sound, and language all at once

	- Imagine a more powerful ChatGPT that can see, listen, as well as read. That's what Google is building. I'm sure OpenAI is too, but Facebook + Google employ like 80% of all machine learning PhD's. OpenAI is just more willing to ship in progress tech, and they have a good PR team ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sterlingcrispin/status/1606064297867710468))
	- People say "There's no moat! AI flattens everything" and there's truth to that, but Google Assistant is in the pockets of 3 billion people, and their TPU data centers are a moat
	  
	  There's so much going on behind the scenes at FB/APPL/GOOG  that the public doesn't hear about, ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sterlingcrispin/status/1606064299444621312))
	- I expect that there will continue to be a bunch of flashy tech demos and quickly thrown together apps on top of them that provide real value to people, but assuming the most advanced system you have access to is the most advanced system, is short sighted and misinformed ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sterlingcrispin/status/1606064300811988993))
	- @lexmakesthings reminded me that Google published LaMDA last year that’s more conversational based, sort of like ChatGPT. But they’re concerned about factuality, bias, racism, abuse etc and aren’t releasing the model
	  
	  OpenAI’s style is yolo-ethics

	- Anyway, Google, and probably Apple Microsoft and Facebook, have made insane progress on this stuff. And when it’s ready, it’s going to go off like a bomb and totally upend society https://t.co/Y2oZFzEFZF ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sterlingcrispin/status/1606073169210548224))
