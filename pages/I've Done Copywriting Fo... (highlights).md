	- Tip: weave features with benefits.
	  
	  Features tell visitors what/how. Benefits tell them why. What root issue is your product solving? Write that as your headline.
	  
	  Example: @KennethCassel's Slip.

	- Tip: questions drive action
	  
	  Ask your visitors a compelling question that pushes attention to your CTA. 
	  
	  "Don't think you can make your pages look this good?" The reader can't help but click to find out more.
	  
	  Example: @unbounce

	- Tip: write a "how it works" section
	  
	  In three simple steps describe what users can do with your product and how it will improve their life.
	  
	  Example: @PaulYacoubian / @chris__lu with @copy_ai

	- Tip: problem, agitate, solution.
	  
	  Address the main problem your visitors have. Agitate it with a short statement. Then serve your product as the ideal solution.
	  
	  Example: @damengchen's Testimonial.

	- Tip: reduce friction with data
	  
	  Consideration spans are short. Use numbers to show ease of adoption: 10 minutes, zero code, done.
	  
	  Example: @matthlavacka's JobBoardSheet

	- Tip: showcase demand with your copy
	  
	  Tell visitors how great your product is with real user statistics like recent signups, not jargon or buzzwords. 
	  
	  Example: @SoapBoxHQ 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1wgdA_WYAENa26.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jmoserr/status/1395025669269172230))
	- Tip: replace buzzwords
	  
	  Cut words like supercharge, unleash, unlock. Instead, use phrases like improve, solves, or better yet, actual results and data.
	  
	  Example: @harrydry 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1wgdS3WUAUaTb-.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jmoserr/status/1395025675204153346))
	- Tip: be clever AND clear
	  
	  Utilize puns or a play on words without sacrificing clarity. Simple yet witty copy sparks interest to keep scrolling.
	  
	  Example: @KaterinaMarkov's @ritual 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1wgdq7XEAw24Ru.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jmoserr/status/1395025681982033926))
	- Tip: hook, then explain.
	  
	  Grab attention with a benefit-rich statement. Then, explain how your product gets the visitor there with ease. 
	  
	  This is what drives signups.
	  
	  Example: @kevinyun's @GrowSurf 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1wgeBMWYAI7kUH.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jmoserr/status/1395025686499319812))
	- Tip: CTA button copywriting
	  
	  Your CTA button shouldn't say "get started." It should tell users the exact step they are about to take to produce action and commitment.
	  
	  What happens when they click? Write that. 
	  
	  Example: @buymeacoffee 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1wgeXeXMAEskim.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jmoserr/status/1395025693428183043))

	- Bonus tip: use customer quotes as copy
	  
	  Instead of a stand-alone testimonial section, put customer quotes in the header/hero. Social proof is the best conversion copywriting.
	  
	  Example: @hnshah's @usefyi
