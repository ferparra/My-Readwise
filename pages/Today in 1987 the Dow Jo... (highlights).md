	- Today in 1987 the Dow Jones crashed 22.6% in what is remembered as Black Monday.
	  
	  @MorningBrew and @its_ahickey wrote about it today and it's a great opportunity for some highlight lessons for the value investor ðŸ§µ
	- The price has temporarily changed, putting many great companies on sale.
	  
	  Realizing the intrinsic value of most of the companies is all the same, and avoiding market fear, could generate awesome opportunities for investment.

	- The Dow Jones as a whole recovered fully by 1989.
	  Just 2 years, which means ~22% gain for those coming into the DJ on the fall, and even better for those choosing great companies on relatively even better sale prices.
