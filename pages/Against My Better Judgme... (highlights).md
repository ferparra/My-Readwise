	- against my better judgment I shall proceed to unpack this shitpost https://t.co/boKhblB5EV ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1373695249135058946))
	- prompted by this thread, which correctly points out the benefit of jargon: that it allows for making distinctions that you care about while ignoring distinctions other people care about
	  https://t.co/Akr6zPieMp ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1373695250145943560))
	- it's true that jargon makes it harder for others to understand what you're talking about, though this is not really the big problem (and can be a feature depending on what you want to do) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1373695251295141892))
	- the big problem is jargon that starts with a precise, distinct meaning and then spreads out to fill the vague space formerly occupied by the ordinary words that the jargon replaced in specific situations ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1373695252125646848))
	- for instance

	- this is common among technically minded individuals who want vague terms to be grounded out in ways that are either firmly defensible (as objectively correct methods) or interesting (that mark me as a cool smart person) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1373695254168240133))
	- Now to apply this to "priors" in particular: the use of the terms "priors" and "updating" in casual use by, shall we say, Technically-Minded People (TMP) has a bunch of desirable features, emphasizing that: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1373695256013721600))
	- that plausibility is not binary (just true or false)
	- these things are all easy to forget when using nearby concept in ordinary English ("I believe X", "I changed my mind to Y", etc), so it's very useful to have a set of communication norms that emphasize them ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1373695257964056578))
	- Bayesian language is therefore very appealing to TMP: it emphasizes a bunch of important things while being grounded in the Objective Correctness of Math*

	- what are the terms + conditions? well, Bayes' theorem is a statement about the ways that you can factor a joint probability distribution. in the applied version, you are factoring a joint space of data (D) and hypotheses (H) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1373695259893506054))
	- you need to
	- it is very hard to do all this! it is usually a good idea to attempt to do this in order to see how hard it is, but it's very hard! sufficiently hard that it is not, in fact, what people are usually doing when they invoke the phrase "updating my priors" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1373697162920525824))
	- instead they are doing some difficult to define thing that is like "changing their mind" while keeping in mind the various desiderata that made learning about Bayes theorem feel so insightful
	  https://t.co/NIQ5Ww121w ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1373698137672536066))
	- there is a sort of gap in conceptual space between what was formerly occupied by "changing your mind", which has ceded some territory, and "updating your priors", which technically only has a very narrow purview but is also The Correct Thing To Say ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1373699302074253318))
	- and if you are focused on those desiderata (for good reason), you end up spending most of your time in that gap, and need a way to talk about it. so you catch yourself every time you were going to say the old term and replace it with the new term ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1373700516941869062))
	- this brings us back to Nate's original tweet: over time, the term that was initially designed to track a very fine distinction no longer serves that function ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1373701092278681605))
	- this is a problem in scenes as dilution happens heterogeneously. it can simultaneously be true that a term is used in context to make powerful distinctions _and_ that it is used in different contexts as a way of pretending you are special when you're recapitulating a normal idea ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1373702624218865666))
	- so someone can accurately notice the latter, critique the scene for it, and then get counter-critique on the basis of the former. of course, they can also inaccurately assume that any jargon must be in the latter category ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1373703206073737220))
