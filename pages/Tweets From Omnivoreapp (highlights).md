- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Dec 22nd, 2022]]
	- Omnivore is a free and open source read-it-later app. Save interesting articles, newsletter subscriptions, and documents and read them later.
	- 9: Omnivore integrates with apps like [[@readwise]] and [[@logseq]] for syncing notes and highlights, but also supports sending data via webhooks. 
	  
	  I backup my links to Google Sheets using a webhook and IFTTT (and briefly turned on the Roomba every time I saved an article about vacuums)
