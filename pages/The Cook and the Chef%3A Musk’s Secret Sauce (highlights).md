document_note:: Elon Musk's "reasoning from first principles" is a powerful way of thinking that involves discovering what already exists and using his powers of connection and persuasion to create change. Creative thinking is similar in that the thinker needs to invent their own thought pathways. By contrast, "reasoning by analogy" is a way of thinking that relies on conventional wisdom and follows cook-like behavior. For those wishing to move closer to the chef side of the spectrum, they must remember to remember, ignore conventional wisdom, and experience an epiphany that neither failing nor changing is a big deal.

	- Life is a flood of incoming data of all kinds that enter the brain through our senses, and it’s the software that assesses and filters all that input, processes and organizes it, and ultimately uses it to generate the key output—a decision.

	- A scientist gathers together only what he or she knows to be true—the first principles—and uses those as the puzzle pieces with which to construct a conclusion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grngq8fdhv5e51sgxr1018w9))

	- Brain software has four major decision-making centers:
	  
	  **1) Filling in the Want box**
	  
	  **2) Filling in the Reality box**
	  
	  **3) Goal selection from the Goal Pool**
	  
	  **4) Strategy formation** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grngqyrxmkszvj78ws9sjek7))
	- Musk works through each of these boxes by reasoning from first principles. Filling in the Want box from first principles requires a deep, honest, and independent understanding of yourself. Filling in the Reality box requires the clearest possible picture of the actual facts of both the world and your own abilities. The Goal Pool should double as a Goal Selection Laboratory that contains tools for intelligently measuring and weighing options. And strategies should be formed based on what you know, not on what is typically done. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grngrd7ckawg7br525m1b872))

	- **Tribalism is good when the tribe and the tribe member both have an independent identity and they *happen* to be the same.** The tribe member has chosen to be a part of the tribe because it happens to match who he really is. If either the identity of the tribe or the member evolves to the point where the two no longer match, the person will leave the tribe. Let’s call this **conscious tribalism.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grngxggk33yt6wgwj2s8227k))

	- **Tribalism is bad when the tribe and tribe member’s identity are one and the same.** The tribe member’s identity is determined by whatever the tribe’s dogma happens to say. If the identity of the tribe changes, the identity of the tribe member changes with it in lockstep. The tribe member’s identity can’t change independent of the tribal identity because the member has no independent identity. Let’s call this **blind tribalism.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grngxtxjs2v6qr84gs2e5rrc))

	- Humans want internal security, and for someone who grows up feeling shaky about their own distinctive character, a tribe and its guiding dogma is a critical lifeline—a one-stop shop for a full suite of human opinions and values.
