	  Here are 20 practical career lessons they shared with me üëáüëáüëá ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199492062191617))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Always strive to simultaneously be overrated and underrated.
	  
	  Contrary to popular belief, being overrated is good. It opens doors and gives you credibility.
	  
	  But don‚Äôt let this go to your head. Stay hungry, humble and hardworking. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199494134108160))
	- Most people overinvest in expiring skills & underinvest in permanent skills.
	  
	  Expiring skills are tactical; their relevance diminishes with time and technology
	  
	  Permanent skills are evergreen and create disproportionate impact 
	  
	  E.g. communication, judgement, trust, empathy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199496608694272))
	- Get comfortable with being uncomfortable 
	  
	  If you get advice from enough people, the advice will cancel out. 
	  
	  You can find 2 smart people to take opposite sides of the argument on virtually every topic.
	  
	  Focus on developing your instincts and trusting your own intuition. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199499301511169))
	- Surround yourself with open minded people vs. close minded people
	  
	  Open Minded People:
	- Sweat the details
	  
	  Most people hate messes and avoid them like the plague. 
	  
	  But this is where the impact lives.
	  
	  If you let details go, you slowly chip away at your core. 
	  
	  Doing 1% less consistently makes underachievement inevitable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199506712784896))
	- Focus on inputs vs. outputs.
	  
	  It‚Äôs really important to separate inputs (process) from output (outcomes).
	  
	  Every so often you will have a great outcome that seemingly comes out of nowhere ‚Äî this is luck.
	  
	  Do not get seduced by it.
	  
	  It isn't repeatable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199511657984000))
	- Be ruthless about what you say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to.
	  
	  Every commitment is 2 decisions: 
	  
	  1. A decision to engage on X 
	  
	  AND 
	  
	  2. A decision not to engage on Y.
	  
	  Guard your time. As the road widens, many of the detours are seductive. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199513570476037))
	- Consistency is the most underrated element of success
	  
	  Most people hit roadblocks and give up. 
	  
	  Successful people understand roadblocks are a part of the journey.
	  
	  When you hit a roadblock - embrace it, work through it, celebrate and then ‚Äúre-rate‚Äù your baseline. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199517609730048))
	- Work like a lion, not a cow
	  
	  Cows consistently graze. This is akin to 9-5 jobs. Always operating at ~30% efficiency.
	  
	  Lions pounce in bursts. This is counterintuitive. Work on high intensity, high value projects. Execute at 120%.
	  
	  Rest. Rejuvenate. Repeat. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199521317507079))
	- Nip problems in the bud quickly.
	  
	  Every complexity starts out as a snowball. Address it head on.
	  
	  If you let it fester, it‚Äôll turn into a boulder and you‚Äôll either (a) get crushed or (b) have to spend an inhumane amount of energy to fix it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199523385143300))
	- There are 2 paths to success:
	- Luck can be created
	  
	  Build in public. Send that cold email. Build relationships with people you look up to.
	  
	  The most interesting opportunities are never on job boards, they‚Äôre created organically. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199528112230400))
	- History is filled with businesses and people that win because they have the best story.

	- Become a master at sales and negotiation
	  
	  Every opening is a sale - partnerships, recruiting, vision, fundraising
	  
	  Every close is a negotiation - hiring, alignment, price, terms, value ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199534839795718))
	- Focus on what you can control vs. what you can‚Äôt control
	  
	  Can Control:
	- You can‚Äôt do it alone no matter how great you are
	  
	  To win big, surround yourself with 3 things:
	  
	  1. Other greats
	  2. Role players
	  3. A system that brings out the best in everyone.
	  
	  All three of these are equally important and allow you to thrive. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199543261876232))
	- Play games worth playing
	  
	  How to build a successful business:
	- Having a billion dollars is great, having a billion seconds is priceless.
	  
	  Interesting [[thought experiment]]: 
	  
	  If you had the opportunity to switch places with Warren Buffet, would you do it?
	  
	  You would be a billionaire, but you would also be 90.
	  
	  Time > Money. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199550593519621))
	- Everybody wants the same fundamental things
	  
	  At the end of the day, everyone wants the same thing: to feel fulfilled, maintain pride and enjoy what they‚Äôre doing.
	  
	  Remember that, apply it to every interaction you have and you can get through the toughest of conversations. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199554423107584))
	- Find your anchor.
	  
	  Religion. Family. Friends. Kids. Whatever it is, find it.
	  
	  Life only gets more complicated as you grow older.
	  
	  Anchors help keep it simple - they remind us what actually matters. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199557035978754))
	- BONUS LESSON: Don‚Äôt get high on your own supply.
	  
	  Don‚Äôt be a jerk. It isn‚Äôt cool. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199561154891778))
	- And that's it!
	  
	  I consistently reflect on these 20 lessons - the best part about them is many are counterintuitive / non-obvious.
	  
	  It takes time to internalize and apply these. 
	  
	  Step 1: Digest
	  Step 2: Practice
	  
	  I hope these lessons help you in your journey. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1441199563939844100))
