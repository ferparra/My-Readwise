	  I just wanted to take a moment to geek out because I still can't get over the fact that we know $AAVE has private pools for institutions to try out.
	  
	  I don't think people realize the big deal that is for $ETH and all of defi: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1393209928282673161))

	  @fintechfrank (probably one of the most reliable folks around when it comes to scoops from great sources) 
	  
	  Noted sources tell him we underestimate the amount of institutional money readying to get into ETH by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.

	  (By the way, many people think an order of magnitude is a multiple. Like 1x or 2x. It isn't. It is when you move a decimal. So like 100 to 1000 is an order of magnitude.) ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1WoBU5WUAQlSJE.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1393209932686708737))

	  Big investors are saying we under estimate the amount  by 1-2 orders of magnitude, and despite that early adopter institutions helped add $300B to $ETH's marketcap since the new year. ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1WoVtlWYAQFskQ.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1393209936159592449))

	  Right now, the *entire* marketcap of all defi projects according to Coingecko is $143B and the TVL is $138B. ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1Wov91X0AEDh7u.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1393209938873397253))

	  I'll take it even further and strip out anything that isn't a productive asset, is infrastructure related or is to risky or unfamiliar for US institutions.
	  
	  Then I get to a total marketcap of around $46B. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1393209939909390343))

	  Some people look at blue chip defi tokens right now and think they are expensive.
	  
	  But that entire playground is about $48B in value.
	  
	  If even the small contingent of early institutional adopters dive in that means huge multiples for that sector. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1393209940815265799))

	  But, better yet most of these tokens not only earn value from their purchase, but the fact they are productive assets means they earn value from the amount of money locked up in those protocols as well, which will also boom.

	  I think the note about the $AAVE private pools is likely one of this seasons biggest alpha leaks and a lot of people glossed over it or think they are too late to the party.
	  
	  With the scale we're talking its not to late. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1393209942774063107))

	  And if institutions are speaking with Aave, they are speaking with other bluechips as well.
	  
	  Institutions are coming, and they want in on defi.
