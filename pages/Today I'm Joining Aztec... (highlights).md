	- Today I'm joining Aztec (@aztecnetwork) to lead growth.
	  
	  We're bringing privacy to Web3, powered by the magic of zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs).
	  
	  I'm sad to end my illustrious LARPing career, but I truly believe this is the most important thing I can do.
	  
	  To the moon math!

	- When I started tweeting about crypto in March of this year, my entry point was Defi.
	  
	  The idea that anyone could transact without limitation, secured by public, transparent, auditable smart contracts was pretty fucking mind blowing.
	  
	  So why work on privacy infrastructure? ü§î ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonwu_/status/1446287235112845313))
	- The deeper I got, the more obvious it was that Ethereum wasn't ready to take us to the future on its own.
	  
	  It's not just about solving the trilemma by scaling cost + speed.
	  
	  It's about enabling entire *classes* of programmably private use cases only made possible with ZK proofs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonwu_/status/1446287236266295298))
	- We take it as a given that every contract, transaction, and interaction must be public.
	  
	  But what if we could have privacy and retain auditability?
	  
	  What if we could keep the security guarantees of $ETH at orders of magnitude lower cost?
	  
	  That's Aztec. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonwu_/status/1446287237356744707))
	- This is also a personal journey.
	  
	  My whole life I've carried my credentials and begged for entry into highly-permissioned organizations.
	  
	  Throughout, I saw two grievous errors:
	  1) Liars faked their way in
	  2) Genuinely capable individuals weren't given the chance to earn a spot ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonwu_/status/1446287238422151168))
	- When I learned @zac_aztec, @jaosef and team were building at the bleeding edge of zero-knowledge to solve both problems, I was thrilled.
	  
	  "I can prove any fact without revealing it" sounds psycho, but once you see it, you can't unsee it.
	  
	  This is the way we're going to interact. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonwu_/status/1446287239462326272))
	- As much as it's about technology, our collective effort is deeply human.
	  
	  A world that assumes privacy by default is:
	- My mission at Aztec is simple:
	  
	  Help the world understand, use, and build scalable private applications.
	  
	  The unlimited potential of zero-knowledge proofs is waiting to be unlocked.
	  
	  Let's get building--I can't wait to show you what's possible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonwu_/status/1446287241567870977))
