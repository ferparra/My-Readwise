	- Gibson Biddle’s **DHM** model of product strategy, he advocates for product leaders to ask “*How will your product* ***delight*** *customers, in* ***hard-to-copy****,* ***margin-enhancing*** *ways?*”. Product managers should be thinking through whether the features they build are margin-enhancing. If not, then engineering time might be better spent elsewhere.

	- Good-better-best ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhpy1th2km6crcbjbywp3jc))
	- Use case/persona ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhpyb3s0zq1zn92w7mesqwf))
	- Functional/modular ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhpyg00r5wj2d4mfht04jsh))
	- **Consumption:** This approach may be thought of as a “platform plus additional features and services” which can be consumed and paid for at the point of need. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhpyqejv8ayw097zbrdpyfz))
	- **Add-ons:** Add-ons sit outside the core packaging structure, and work well with any of the approaches discussed above. They allow buyers to customise aspects of their purchase (and in so doing, increase engagement with the product and commitment). This works very well for niche, high-value features which don’t obviously fit into any of the defined packages. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhpyzv0j05eyb05mr6z06d0))
	- ![Framework to prioritise features for packaging strategy](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/631f0f414f23e8ab7dcbf0bc/6325084804c4e398ca11c3ec_value%20adoption%20graph.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhpz79cjj72yvvkeezacyak))
	- **High adoption and low willingness-to-pay** features should be included in all packages as standard. This would also have been reflected in the **must-have** profiling. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhq0bph1c5n5jmj4r2csa74))
	- **High adoption and high willingness-to-pay** features should be included in premium versions of the product. They may also be included as standard in order to support a higher-priced customer entry point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhq0ga7wh0hyyb2x4vwwdvq))
	- **Low adoption and low willingness-to-pay** features could be prime candidates for rationalisation. If we apply the DHM model referenced earlier, there could be a strong argument for sunsetting the feature as it neither delights customers nor is margin enhancing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhq0p16ev3t57t7km984k1h))
	- **Low adoption and high willingness-to-pay** features may be ideal add-ons. Equally, it may be appropriate to include them in a premium version of the product. If adoption is focused on a particular segment, including it in a package aimed at that segment may be the answer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhq0z5ezjxsxa3tyf8t2n8a))
