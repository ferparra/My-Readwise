document_note:: This document outlines a framework in which machine learning can be used to guide human intuition in the discovery of new mathematical theorems and conjectures. Examples of successful applications of this framework are given in distinct areas of pure mathematics, such as topology and representation theory, where it has helped mathematicians understand complex mathematical objects and uncover previously unknown relationships. The framework involves the use of supervised machine learning to detect patterns and relationships, and attribution techniques to understand and confirm them. Ultimately, the framework is intended to help mathematicians collaborate with AI to uncover new mathematical insights.

	- A mathematician‚Äôs intuition plays an enormously important role in mathematical discovery‚Äî‚ÄúIt is only with a combination of both rigorous formalism and good intuition that one can tackle complex mathematical problems‚Äù[25](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04086-x#ref-CR25) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grd2bgt2gtj2rctv27n79nwx))

	- Low-dimensional topology is an active and influential area of mathematics. Knots, which are simple closed curves in ‚Ñù3R3{{\mathbb{R}}}^{3}, are one of the key objects that are studied, and some of the subject‚Äôs main goals are to classify them, to understand their properties and to establish connections with other fields.

	- Our hypothesis was that there exists an undiscovered relationship between the hyperbolic and algebraic invariants of a knot. A supervised learning model was able to detect the existence of a pattern between a large set of geometric invariants and the signature *œÉ*(*K*), which is known to encode important information about a knot *K*, but was not previously known to be related to the hyperbolic geometry.

	- Representation theory is the theory of linear symmetry. The building blocks of all representations are the irreducible ones, and understanding them is one of the most important goals of representation theory. Irreducible representations generalize the fundamental frequencies of Fourier analysis[28](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04086-x#ref-CR28) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grd2amstktdjm1ekmvx511h5))

	- Rather than use machine learning to directly generate conjectures, we focus on helping guide the highly tuned intuition of expert mathematicians, yielding results that are both interesting and deep. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grd279ee74v1e5qypjtsza26))
	- In the supervised learning stage, the mathematician proposes a hypothesis that there exists a relationship between *X*(*z*) and *Y*(*z*). In this work we assume that there is no known function mapping from *X*(*z*) to *Y*(*z*), which in turn implies that *X* is not invertible (otherwise there would exist a known function *Y*‚Äâ¬∞‚Äâ*X*‚Äâ‚àí1). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grd2852hmx3j15gqe9mkbefv))
	- If a relationship is found, the attribution stage is to probe the learned function ùëìÃÇ¬†f^\hat{f} with attribution techniques to further understand the nature of the relationship. These techniques attempt to explain what features or structures are relevant to the predictions made by ùëìÃÇ¬†f^\hat{f}, which can be used to understand what parts of the problem are relevant to explore further.
