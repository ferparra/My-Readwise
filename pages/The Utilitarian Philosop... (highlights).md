	- The Utilitarian Philosophy of Shirou Emiya
	  
	  Shirou is a character defined by ideals. Those ideals though are not his own but have a lineage that dates back to the 18th century. This thread will highlight the key aspects of Shirou’s ideals and how they relate to utilitarianism.

	- Utilitarianism is not a straightforward philosophical movement and many thinkers have contributed to how the philosophy has evolved. The first classical utilitarian though was Jermey Bentham who was was interested in human nature. He felt humans were ruled by two principles.

	- These principles were to seek pleasure and avoid pain and through this devised the idea of utility as a way to guide the actions of people and governments. Actions are considered just when they are designed to promote happiness, or pleasure, and unjust when they cause unhappiness

	- Or pain. Bentham’s ideas were the foundation for the most important utilitarian of the 19th century John Stuart Mill. Mill enlarged the scope of Bentham’s claims highlighting how man is not completely selfish. There are people that some will care for more than their own life.

	- Importantly when those we care for are harmed it causes a strong sense of guilt within us for allowing such harm to come about. Mill also argued that man’s motivations were underwritten by their sense of justice. Both of these principles are critical to Shirou’s character.

	- Shirou carries with him a heavy sense of survivor’s guilt due to being the lone survivor of the great Shinto fire wondering why he was given the opportunity to live while everyone died around him. This becomes closely intertwined with Shirou’s desire to become a hero of justice.

	- Shirou does not want to see anyone go through the same traumatic experience he went through. He’s a firm believer that all people deserve an equal opportunity at happiness and detests many of the worlds inequalities and wants to protect people from them.

	- Similarly Bentham and Mill believed that utilitarianism should inform inform law and social policy. Mill was a massive proponent of free speech and of women’s suffrage when he was alive and both argued that clinging to social traditions impeded acquiring universal happiness.

	- The principle seems straightforward but while it is in the collectives best interests to promote happiness for the collective it is also at odds with many who wish to act for their own pleasure.

	- Shirou I would argue is an example of an extreme utilitarian for he cares nothing for his own well being or happiness. For Shirou the very act of helping and protecting others is enough of a reward. If a normal utilitarian would sacrifice one to save the many then Shirou

	- Would volunteer over and over again to be the one person who is sacrificed in order for others to achieve happiness. Shirou at the beginning of Fate/Stay Night believes his chance at happiness for himself is impossible and unworthy to someone like him. The only thing that give

	- His life meaning is if he fulfills the promise he made to Kiritsugu to carry on his dream. In the subsequent routes of FSN his extreme utilitarianism is challenged by all the characters in the story who wish to instill in Shirou a sense of self worth and that he can to pertake

	- In the happiness that he has been able to give people. In the view of philosopher Thomas Hobbes the central problem with man is that they are inherently selfish. For Shirou it is the opposite he is so selfless that the question is posed if he’s even human.

	- The question then that FSN poses is can Shirou find happiness without sacrificing the ideals that are so core to his existence. Through Shirou it is also pointing the question at the audience and what do you value more your ideals or your happiness.

	- Shirou in FSN becomes increasingly aware of the hardships that come with his dream of becoming a hero of justice who brings about a more peaceful world and constantly faces his insecurities on whether he can achieve that dream.

	- In this I find the Utilitarian ideals that guide Shirou to be both tragic and beautiful. Utilitarianism is a philosophy about how the world should work, embracing policies that leads to happiness for majority, but often doesn’t. It is also a philosophy that has also been

	- Criticized for its naïveté and inability to quantify what will bring happiness to majority of people as happiness is an evolving concept. The philosophy then is not perfect but that also makes it the ideal philosophy for Shirou who is an incredibly imperfect character.

	- Shirou wants to protect others but doesn’t know what the correct path will be to achieve that goal or if it’s even achievable. Shirou like many utilitarians knows that creating an idyllic society is impossible but it doesn’t him from wanting to create one.

	- The hardships down his path are many but his road is very reflective of the human experience. Shirou teaches us that even if the probability of changing the world is exceptionally small that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to create a better world where everyone can live happily.

	- If you have made it to the end of this thread I am very grateful. I hope this thread did shed insight on his character and his ideals are rooted in the utilitarian tradition. Thank you @KuroiEnpitsu for allowing me to use your art for this thread and enjoy Shirou Day.
