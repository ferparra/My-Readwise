document_note:: This document summarizes the book "The Trouble with Fusion" by Lawrence Lidsky of MIT, outlining the advantages and disadvantages of fusion energy. The author concludes that fusion is more complex and less reliable than fission and risks nuclear weapons proliferation. However, they remain hopeful that private companies in the space can overcome the engineering challenges, while also acknowledging the advantages of fission, which has been reliable since the 1950s and has higher energy density.

	- Fusing nuclei in plasma requires forcing charged particles into each other, so smaller nuclei require less energy input to fuse ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv3071vzcx15n3hgwc5cpk48))

	- Fusion definitely has some benefits, but the new ability to extract uranium from seawater has removed the seawater/Deuterium benefit. The only thing left is waste. Fission waste is worse, but we already have a system for storing it. Fusion still doesn't even work on earth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv308k8g8aht0j7hrvs0zxyc))
