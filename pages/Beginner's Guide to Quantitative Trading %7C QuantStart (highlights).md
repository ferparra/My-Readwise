	- All quantitative trading processes begin with an initial period of research. This research process encompasses finding a strategy, seeing whether the strategy fits into a portfolio of other strategies you may be running, obtaining any data necessary to test the strategy and trying to optimise the strategy for higher returns and/or lower risk.
	- Many of the strategies you will look at will fall into the categories of mean-reversion and trend-following/momentum. A mean-reverting strategy is one that attempts to exploit the fact that a long-term mean on a "price series" (such as the spread between two correlated assets) exists and that short term deviations from this mean will eventually revert. A momentum strategy attempts to exploit both investor psychology and big fund structure by "hitching a ride" on a market trend, which can gather momentum in one direction, and follow the trend until it reverses.
	- The goal of backtesting is to provide evidence that the strategy identified via the above process is profitable when applied to both historical and out-of-sample data. This sets the expectation of how the strategy will perform in the "real world".
	- A dataset with survivorship bias means that it does not contain assets which are no longer trading.
	- Risk management also encompasses what is known as optimal capital allocation, which is a branch of portfolio theory. This is the means by which capital is allocated to a set of different strategies and to the trades within those strategies.
