	  Got Bumblebee and #StableDiffusion running in @livebookdev!

	- 2/ More progress on #dreambooth in @elixirlang
	  
	  Managed to get #StableDiffusion running without using the Nx.Serving pipeline, enabling full control over each part of the process.

	- 3/ Thanks to the ðŸª„ of Kino and @livebookdev, this doesn't require saving frames and stitching them together using ffmpeg. 
	  
	  Kino makes it totally trivial to visualize results and make notebooks interactive ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hanrelan/status/1604206222567444480))
