	- It's All In Your Assumptions
	  
	  That's one of the things I've learned about decision making over the last couple of years.
	  
	  And recently I've played with a very interesting technique to tease out my assumptions:
	  
	  The Key Assumptions Check: ðŸ§µðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1640470580037320705))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- The Key Assumptions Check works like this:
	  
	  1.  Write down and clarify your current analysis of the problem or situation you're dealing with.
	  
	  Don't focus on assumptions yet, but the summary of your thoughts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1640470582751023105))
	- 2.  Set a timer for 10 minutes, and write down all the assumptions you've made in your analysis.
	  
	  Ask the standard journalistic questions: Who influences the situation? What do they want? How are they going to act? When? Where? Why do we think so? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1640470585393426432))
	- 3.  Watch out for three key phrases:
	  
	  â€¢ will always
	  
	  â€¢ will never
	  
	  â€¢ would have to be
	  
	  They are signs of unchallenged ideas/assumptions.
	  
	  Fix that.
	  
	  Also: "based on" and "generally the case" need to be challenged too! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1640470588019064832))
	- 4.  After listing all assumptions, examine them:
	  
	  Am I confident that this assumption is correct? Why? How confident am I?
	  
	  When might this assumption be untrue? Could it have been true in the past but not any longer?
	  
	  If it's invalid, what happens to the analysis? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1640470590674075648))
	- 5.  Place each assumption in one of three categories:
	  
	  Basically solid (S)
	  
	  Correct with caveats (C)
	  
	  Unsupported or questionable â€“ "key uncertainties" (U) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1640470593257754627))
	- 6.  Refine the list
	  
	  Remove bad assumptions. Then focus hard on assumptions that change the conclusion if they are wrong.
	  
	  7.  Turn key uncertainties into research projects to gather more information on, if they have material impact on the conclusion
	  
	  And then: review it all! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1640470595803705346))
	- 8.  Review the results of this key assumption check
	  
	  How good is your evidence?
	  How reliable are your sources for this evidence?
	  
	  How likely is it THAT YOUR CONCLUSION IS WRONG?
	  
	  Focus on how likely it is you might be wrong â€“ this offsets positivity bias. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1640470598441930752))
	- I love this technique, and I highly suggest you read the book that I have it from:
	  
	  Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis
	  https://t.co/jLO4vhYJ3G
	  
	  It's worth a close study. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1640470601042382848))
