	- We just shipped a new blog post I wrote on the @dagster blog. It's a step-by-step tutorial on how to build a ChatGPT-like bot that can answer technical questions about any GitHub repo using a great new Python library - @langchain - and the @OpenAI API.

	- One of the big challenges we've faced at the @dagster project is the rapid growth of our Slack community. We want to deliver a great support experience, so this means we have an engineer on-call basically full-time during the workday just answering Slack questions.

	- When ChatGPT came out we wanted to explore whether we could build a similar bot to alleviate our increasing support burden. This led us down a fun and educational rabbit hole of large language model chains, vector space search indexes, and data pipeline orchestration.

	- The overall end product is pretty cool, and adaptable to your own GitHub repo. Check out our blog post to learn more! And thanks to @hwchase17 for the great @langchain library! (4/4) https://t.co/ZVLqh5V3LA ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/floydophone/status/1612529024567500800))
