	- DNA methylation analysis can help researchers gain valuable insight into gene regulation and identify potential biomarkers. Aberrant DNA methylation has been implicated in many disease processes, including cancer, obesity, and addiction. DNA methylation is also a common subject of agrigenomic investigations into responses to drought, temperature extremes, and other environmental changes.
	- High-throughput technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and microarrays enable genome-wide methylation profiling studies. These technologies offer new ways to understand the significance of DNA methylation, providing novel insights into the functional consequences of variation.
