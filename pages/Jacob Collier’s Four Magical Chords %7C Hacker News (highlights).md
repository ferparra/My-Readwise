	- These days I'm more interested in [[resonance]]. It creates excitation and movement across multiple dimensions. It starts in one place and time, and ends up spilling across the rest of your lives and that of others. Maybe you were at a concert, or a church service, or around a campfire when some music struck your 'heart strings'. Something about that sound [[energy]] turned your mesh of physiology in a new direction. Maybe when you were driving home you realized something about yourself, and eventually your career took a new path; maybe your love for someone became clear. Whatever happened next, the places you traveled, the things you purchased, the fields you trod upon; all real-world effects started when part of you resonated with some sound energy.
