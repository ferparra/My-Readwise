	- Learning curves are the most powerful facet of deployment-led-innovation, but they are not an ironclad law. As tech matures, repeatable parts of the cost structure shrink compared to non-repeatable parts. Harder to stay on the curve when this happens. https://t.co/wJ89JzC5eq ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TimMLatimer/status/1600205380344111104))

	- Here is a great example from SunRun. Costs are up from 2015 to 2022 despite a significant drop in module costs. Why? Module costs used to be a huge % of the overall cost structure, now it's very small. Continued cost declines aren't enough to overcome soft cost increases.

	- You can see that trend even more clearly with SolarCity numbers, who was public earlier and reported further back in time. Much easier to drop costs between 2012 and 2015 when modules are 50% of your cost structure and dropping lock a rock.

	- Here is a great overview of the when and how learning curves apply, based on customization. What's interesting is you can also expand this to think about sub-components of energy tech systems--some are standardized, some can not be. https://t.co/9lID9ETwAa
