	- This week I had @chamath on the pod for a hard hitting 80 min discussion.
	  
	  Man, this was fun.
	  
	  Here‚Äôs 15 unique insights I learned from one of the greatest tech icons of our generation üëáüëáüëá ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884042221789194))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Chatting with @chamath was a blast.
	  
	  He has a special ability to dissect complex topics and articulate them elegantly.
	  
	  I also found him to be a down to earth guy that was incredibly generous with his time.
	  
	  Alright...onto the insights: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884043975008259))
	- Insight 1: The world is best understood through the lens of a pendulum
	  
	  This pendulum swings between 2 poles:
	  
	  Centralization -- Decentralization
	  
	  Technology accelerates the shift to decentralization.
	  
	  This necessitates a shift in the role of private enterprise and government ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884047066206209))
	- Insight 2: What can and is possible with technology will become manifest destiny
	  
	  This will have a material impact on society.
	  
	  Positive: Mass advancement via democratization, decentralization and creation.
	  
	  Negative: Mass instability via insecurity, inequality and classism. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884049385664519))
	- Insight 3: Mimetic desires are more extreme in a connected world
	  
	  Humans aren't born with a natural inclination to "want."
	  
	  We "want" because others "have."
	  
	  Technology allows us to see everyone's "haves."
	  
	  Continually chasing the hedonic treadmill is a path to misery. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884051054923781))
	- Insight 4: The political spectrum is a circle not a line
	  
	  The extreme left and extreme right are not polar opposites; they're the same.
	  
	  Both have a rigid world view of moral absolutism.
	  
	  The further we stray from rational centrism, the tougher it will be to form social unity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884053701545985))
	- Insight 5: Thoughtful capital allocation is the most positive sum force for advancing humanity.
	  
	  There are 3 kinds of capital a leader must allocate:
	  
	  1. Human Capital
	  2. Product Capital
	  3. Monetary Capital
	  
	  The intersection of all 3 produces outsized outcomes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884056633364484))
	- Insight 6: Crypto evolves capitalism
	  
	  The best part of capitalism is the ability to effect change with money.
	  
	  The worst part of capitalism are the historical artifacts that repress cohorts of people.
	  
	  Crypto decentralizes and democratizes.
	  
	  It's a more inclusionary system. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884059611373569))
	- Insight 7: New value measured by old metrics creates tension
	  
	  Today anybody can acquire skills to be self-sufficient.
	  
	  The internet is the great equalizer. But only if we allow it to be.
	  
	  The longer "where you went to school" > "what can you do", the more conflict will persist ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884061519814657))
	- Insight 8: 98% of people in the world don‚Äôt achieve their full potential
	  
	  We have architected a system filled with artificial constraints.
	  
	  But imagine a world in which we expanded the numerator, not just the denominator.
	  
	  Developing 10 more superstars could 10x our progress. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884063365312513))
	- Insight 9: Long term thinking is the ultimate arbitrage
	  
	  Private markets - managers show paper markups to raise a next fund.
	  
	  Public markets - managers take low risk bets to prevent redemption.
	  
	  Both markets subject managers to short termism.
	  
	  Do the opposite to win the game. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884065776930816))
	- Insight 10: Public policy should focus on equality, not equity.
	  
	  Equality is positive sum - it allows more people in the world to participate.
	  
	  Equity is zero sum - in the interest of fairness, it equivocates outcomes. Counterintuitively, this puts a ceiling on all of humanity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884068213927938))
	- Insight 11: Traditional institutions have lost product-market fit
	  
	  The inevitable result will be innovation through destruction.
	  
	  Startups will solve the biggest problems filling the void left by the shrinking capability of government, foundations and international organizations. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884070147510275))
	- Insight 12: Participating in the future is reserved for the courageous
	  
	  The solutions to the world's most difficult problems require creating a new path.
	  
	  It is uncomfortable, mocked and held in low regard.
	  
	  Until it isn't.
	  
	  That shift happens slowly and then quickly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884072122933252))
	- Insight 13: First principles thinking is the atomic unit of progress
	  
	  The majority of humans hate change.
	  
	  It‚Äôs unpredictable and challenges our existing beliefs.
	  
	  But change is a necessary condition for growth.
	  
	  We can have the status quo or evolution.
	  
	  Can't have both. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884074685644806))
	- Insight 14: Life is a single player game.
	  
	  There are no rules. There is no right or wrong. 
	  
	  All that matters is self-congruence.
	  
	  The faster you realize this, the more likely you will succeed.
	  
	  Unfortunately, most people sacrifice most of their life to make this discovery. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884077231644675))
	- Insight 15: At the end of the day, everybody just wants to be happy
	  
	  Apply this lens to every interaction you have.
	  
	  More empathy goes a long way towards pushing the world forward.
	  
	  A single action can be the "on-the-margin‚Äù difference to change someone's life. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1457884080423460864))
