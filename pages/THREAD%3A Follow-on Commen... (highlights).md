		- **Note**: Thread
	- The most common response that I got from the thread about inflation is that corporations are just responding to market signals. They have a lot of pricing power right now and they're taking advantage of it, as they should in a capitalist system. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459661528010010634))
	- But that pricing power is itself a side effect of government intervention--a series of historically unprecedented fiscal injections--that helped keep the corporate sector in the green during the crisis. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459661631168913411))
	- In other words, it's not pricing power earned by curing cancer. It's pricing power stumbled upon by occupying a too-big-too-fail position in the system, such that the government had to print money, risking future inflation, to keep you & your customers whole in a crisis. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459661726207643650))
	- Though it's legal to do whatever you want, I'm saying that corporations should be good citizens here, and refrain from using the situation to draw in an even larger windfall for their shareholders, at the expense of inflation losses for others. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459661882902597636))
	- To be clear, increasing profit is 100% fine. But until we get through this weird period, do it on increased volume, which is positive sum for everyone, as opposed to increased price, which creates losses for people who haven't done anything to deserve them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459662124649701377))
	- Examples of such people: anyone w/ savings held outside of the stock market (& RE, crypto, etc.), people living on fixed pension or disability streams, employees who lack wage bargaining power wrt their current employment situations, & so on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459662241964376068))
	- Even if it's a one-time "transitory" process, an uncompensated 15% or 20% loss in the value of your savings or your wage over the next few years is not some small thing. It's a big deal for the person who it lands on. And someone necessarily will be that person. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459662462748405764))
	- Now, a point about MMT. Of all schools, MMT should be the MOST irritated when it sees corporations try to exploit fiscally-induced demand strength via price hikes. In doing that, corporations are undermining MMT's practical viability, when it was MMT that was helping them out! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459663478529138697))
	- In practice, if you use the power of fiscal policy to try to push an economy as far as it can go, you are inevitably going to push demand above supply at certain points. The question is, how will economic participants respond to the pressures that follow? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459664396398043142))
	- Will they attempt & acquiesce to price increases, or will they balk and wait for more supply to come online? The answer partially determines the extent to which the approach can work, without becoming inflationary. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459664667295592453))
	- In Japan, employers are hesitant to attempt price increases, and consumers are averse to accepting them. It's in the culture. That's part of the reason why, right now, consumer prices in Japan aren't really inflating, even w/ everything going on. ~0% YOY CPI, just like b/f Covid. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459665430986076163))
	- B/c of its strong price anchor, Japan has a lot of room for an MMT-inspired fiscal approach, as we've seen. They could overstimulate to the end of the earth, and probably still wouldn't end up w/ an inflation problem. Just inconvenient shortages that eventually clear up. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459665609168498688))
	- In contrast to Japan, try introducing those same pressures & shortages into the Venezuelan economy. You won't get the same hesitation and patience. You will be in an inflation spiral before you can blink. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459665951205597187))
	- wrt the deployment of MMT, it's a good thing to be like Japan & a bad thing to be like Venezuela. In Japan, you won't need to layer on cumbersome additional interventions--price controls, borrowing restrictions, rate hikes, tax hikes, etc.--to stop the system from re-pricing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459667137207980036))
	- Suppose that I could install a chip into everyone's brain, making them completely & utterly averse to attempting or accepting any price increase, ever. A steel anchor that never budges. It would be MMT nirvana. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459667827410018310))
	- If I inject too much demand, the only side effect I will have to deal w/ is shortage. The incentive to improve productivity & increase supply will come from the profit opportunity thereby introduced. There will be other things to worry about, but not broad inflation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459668654526713858))
	- The example is not mean to be realistic, of course, it's just to illustrate that the price anchor affects the space & room for an aggressive fiscal approach to overshoot, without creating follow-on problems like an inflation spiral. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459670410719547400))
	- Finally, w/ respect to the political angle, when bad things are happening, people need a bad guy. If you're in charge, and you can't point to who the bad guy is, guess what... it's YOU. The point may be Machiavellian, but it's true. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459670572682526722))
	- Now, I'm not saying that politicians should be unfair here. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459670714596802563))
	- But I do think a JFK-type strategy of highlighting how obscenely well corporations & their shareholders have done amid this experiment, & calling on them to be good citizens & not exploit the situation further by unnecessarily hiking prices, just b/c they can, would resonate. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459670893731500041))
	- It probably wouldn't actually accomplish anything outside of politics, but the sentiment and the frustration are entirely valid, this is a totally undeserved government-induced windfall for a small segment of the population, do not abuse it! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jesse_Livermore/status/1459671419952979975))
	- For those interested, here is a clean recording of JFK's full April 1962 speech, from the archives. I can only imagine what that speech would have looked like if it were directed at the current situation:
