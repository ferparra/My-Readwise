	- The new WSTETH-A Vaults in MakerDAO allow you to borrow DAI against wrapped $stETH.
	  
	  Alternatively, you can also create a leveraged, long $ETH position using $wstETH, where you would be earning yield from ETH staking and be exposed to any ETH upside.

	- üí°You can also convert any existing MakerDAO $ETH-x Vault into a $wstETH one.
	  
	  The template recipe for this position shift is available right here: https://t.co/Xmm0Ltwn3Y
	  
	  ‚ÑπÔ∏èKeep in mind that WSTETH-A has a liq. ratio of 160% - noticeably higher than both ETH-B and ETH-A.

	- Now that you've opened a $wstETH Maker Vault you may want to consider setting up liquidation protection for it, too.üõ°Ô∏è
	  
	  Our DFS Automation services are now available for WSTETH-A and you can enable liquidation protection, as well as automated leveraging at https://t.co/rGwJYEMVtY ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DeFiSaver/status/1454159917552648192))
	- If you currently have $ETH and are looking to convert that into $stETH or $wstETH - note that you can do so using our Recipe Creator, which has had @LidoFinance support for months now.
	  
	  Here's a recipe that let's you convert $ETH straight into $wstETH: https://t.co/hgMgWljCxd

	- Finally, we also added support for @MakerDAO $DAI Flash Minting with this update and you can now find these options under the Flashloans category in our Recipe Creator!‚ö°Ô∏è
	  
	  The $ETH to $wstETH Vault shift recipe above already uses Dai flash minting.üßô
