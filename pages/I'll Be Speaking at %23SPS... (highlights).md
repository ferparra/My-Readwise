	- I'll be speaking at #SPSP2023 about finding high-value datasets on a budget
	  
	  When I was a grad student, free datasets like WVS,  D-Place, ANES, and NGram were all game-changers for doing cross-cultural or big data research
	  
	  Do you have any other suggestions? Please comment or DM! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/josh_c_jackson/status/1625895374597521408))
