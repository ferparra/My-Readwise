	- First, my thanks to @vjeux and @aakansha1216 for review and pointers! üíï
	  
	  Let's go over some highlights. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dluzar/status/1451279943556546563))
	- You can insert an image in many ways. The most common is pick from your file system.
	  
	  You can then either click to insert, or click-drag to set your own size. https://t.co/PYvYk6aGQ2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dluzar/status/1451279992361529355))
	- You can drag and drop a file onto canvas. https://t.co/thFhgi1mGw ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dluzar/status/1451280028378050562))
	- You can copy an image from the web, filesystem, or elsewhere (such as your favorite screenshot app) and paste it directly on canvas. https://t.co/nfBD4YGPF7 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dluzar/status/1451280063807344645))
