	  So let's say you don't believe what's a classic limiting belief, like, you don't believe that you will ever be the fit, athletic, Adonis that your childhood self wished that you would be, you're never going to have that six pack because six packs aren't just aren't for people who are you, right? Like, I think a lot of us who aren't Adonis's, you know, we might have a thought like that. The because statement basically takes that and it questions that belief. So and it sounds so corny when you do it. So just, you know, you don't have to broadcast this to the world. You just kind of got to do it like subtly in your notes app away from the judging eyes of the public who might think you're cringe for self improving. Maybe that's an Australian thing. Who knows? But you would start a sentence with, I will have call it that athlete's body that I like that I really want because and then every morning you might finish that sentence with five dot points. Then the next day you finish it with five dot points more. Next day you finish it with five more dot points. And these might be things like because I understand that eating healthy is something that I really do enjoy every time I do it. Or it might be because I regularly go to the gym or it might be because I am researching how to actually do this. You know what I mean? And what you and even if it's just one answer to that because statement a day by the end of a year, you've got 365 reasons why you are actively breaking that limiting belief and reminding yourself that every day, like it seems so trivial and nominal. But I think it's I don't know, it's incredibly powerful to do it over a consistent period of time. ([TimeÂ 0:17:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/13be8c4a-25d3-4a79-8a3a-03b6fa837a99))
