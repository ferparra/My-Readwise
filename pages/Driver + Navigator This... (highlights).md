	- Driver + Navigator
	  
	  This is one of my favourite models to encourage collaboration and bring clarity to the messy nature of product work.
	  
	  Rather then having your typical RACI or accountability framework, map out:
	  
	  üöó Who is ‚Äòdriving‚Äô? and
	  üó∫Ô∏è Who is ‚Äònavigating‚Äô?

	- For example, let's take a look at the product process through the lens of the product trio.
	  
	  At the start we're prioritising, setting the strategy and deciding on what to focus on. During this phase, it's typically led by the PM - they would therefore be the ‚Äòdriver‚Äô.

	- But any good PM knows they shouldn‚Äôt do this alone.
	  
	  This is where the ‚Äònavigator‚Äô comes in.
	  
	  They drive the activity forward and are responsible for making sure it happens but they do it collaboratively with design and engineering (and others). These people are ‚Äònavigators‚Äô.

	- This continues throughout the problem space. As we move into the solution space, I like to hand the reins to design.
	  
	  Design then 'drives' the creation of necessary prototypes, organising and executing user testing, etc.
	  
	  But again they don‚Äôt do this alone.
	  
	  And so forth.
