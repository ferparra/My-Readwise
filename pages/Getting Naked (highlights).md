document_note:: In the book "Getting Naked" by Patrick Lencioni, the author details his experience while at a large consulting firm and how his views on handling clients changed when he encountered a smaller, boutique firm. He discovered that Lighthouse Partners made themselves vulnerable and honest to their clients, which led to greater trust and loyalty and ultimately more business. This concept of being "naked" can be applied to life, showing that with creativity and determination, any situation can be made win-win-win.
