	- The #1 principle for engineering teams:
	  
	  Optimize for confidence.
	  
	  Speed, Autonomy, and Certainty come out of confidence.
	  
	  Make it clear how stuff should be done and decisions should be made
	  Use tooling to guide people
	  Leave notes & comments
	  Overcommunicate
	  Acknowledge tech debt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andreasklinger/status/1161731714504204288))
	- This doesn't sound flashy i know
	  
	  But it's imho the guiding principle of all good engineering teams.
	  
	  It allows you to do "hacks" and make them explicit so people know how to handle them. 
	  
	  It allows you to judge "polishing work" (which we engineers love) objectively ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andreasklinger/status/1161732831468351488))
	- Btw i am not saying "maximize confidence"
	  
	  As a team, you consciously decide what level of confidence you are comfortable with. Evaluate efforts and decide on trade-offs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andreasklinger/status/1161733363079626752))

	- This also doesn't mean "optimize for clean code".
	  
	  One of the big advantages startups have is that they need to worry less about the future of their code.
	  
	  You want to leverage this. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andreasklinger/status/1161738402342981632))
	- How can you manage confidence while doing hacks, trade-offs and techdebt?
	  
	  The trick here is to "acknowledge it"
