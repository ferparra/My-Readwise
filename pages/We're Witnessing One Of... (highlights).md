	- We're witnessing one of the coolest human experiments ever. 
	  
	  More than 2,000 people have contributed $3,000,000 in less than 24 hours. 
	  
	  Why? 
	  
	  We're trying to buy the Constitution. 
	  
	  Here's the wild story of @constitutiondao ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1460287874516008969))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Let's set the stage. 
	  
	  September 1787: The Constitution of the United States is signed by 39 delegates in Philadelphia. 
	  
	  Beginning with "We The People," this founding document established a structure of government that existed to serve its people.

	- Now, let's fast forward. 
	  
	  Today, ~11 of 500 originals of The Constitution remain. 
	  
	  Just 1 (of 11) is owned by an individual. 
	  
	  That individual is Howard Goldman. 
	  
	  In 1988, he bought the doc for $165,000. 
	  
	  Howard has since passed and is survived by his wife, Dorothy Goldman.

	- Dorothy is putting the document up for auction. 
	  
	  On Thursday, Sotheby's will handle the sale & anticipates it will cost $15-20 million. 
	  
	  All proceeds will go to Dorothy's non-profit focused on democracy education. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1460287893478555653))
	- Enter ConstitutionDAO. 
	  
	  Austin Cain & Graham Novak are friends from Atlanta. 
	  
	  Recently, Graham texted Austin, "I have a whacky idea."
	  
	  "I like whacky ideas, hit me," Austin responded. 
	  
	  The idea: Put The Constitution in the hands of the people, by buying it together

	- It sounds crazy. 
	  
	  But it just might work. 
	  
	  As of this thread, $3,206,309 has been raised in less than 24 hours. 
	  
	  2,400 people have contributed so far and the community discord channel is up to 8,800. 
	  
	  Remember, this idea is just 5 days old (!)

	- Which leads me to Web 3.0. 
	  
	  To be honest, I've been a skeptic. 
	  
	  95% of crypto, DAO, DeFI projects have been hard to understand or feel like scams. 
	  
	  I've looked for something that makes sense & is 10x better because of Web 3.0 technologies. 
	  
	  Here's why it's @ConstitutionDAO... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1460287910134128641))
	- 1) The invaluable becomes accessible. 
	  
	  Historically, ownership of rare collectibles has been reserved for the 0.1% of the 0.1%. 
	  
	  Unless you had millions, you didn't have a chance. 
	  
	  Via tokenization, you can own a piece of The Constitution by giving as little $ as you want.

	- 2) Pool knowledge, network, and time.
	  
	  Idea: 5 days ago / Auction: in 3.5 days
	  
	  The only way to win is collectively. 
	  
	  With 30 core contributors, this DAO has built a:
	- 3) It's a perfect on-ramp. 
	  
	  You don't have to believe in pixelated JPEGs to buy into ConstitutionDAO. 
	  
	  This project is marrying the physical and digital. 
	  
	  You own a token, you own a piece of history & a highly scarce asset. 
	  
	  It's that simple.

	- 4) Collective ownership aligns incentives.
	  
	  We're part of something bigger than ourselves. 
	  
	  We want to see history made. 
	  
	  It leads to making big asks (Nic Cage, join us). 
	  
	  It leads to memes proliferating the web (ðŸ“œ,ðŸ“œ). 
	  
	  It leads to strangers helping each other. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1460287932837806096))
	- I could go on & on, but I always find the best way to learn is to dive in & do.
