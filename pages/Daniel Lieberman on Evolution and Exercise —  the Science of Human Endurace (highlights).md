	- The Evolution of Human Fatigue Resistance
	  
	  Summary:
	  The average human being is much more endurance adapted than power adapted. Because of the way those muscle fibres work, those lead to less fatigue. So its evolution, again, an evolutionary signal of selection for endurance and fatigue resistance.

	  Let's move on to this paper that you wrote with frank morino and benjamin sibson, the evolution of human fatigue resistance and the journal of comparative physiology. Because this is another thing that, you know, imean, most people have had that e which was that would you rather fight joe ro gan or chimpanzy s you'd rather fight joe rogan but there are strength, power and stamina trade offs. So what are we talking about here, and why is that lensed in the way that it is, through the body of the human being?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, we wrote this paper because there's been very little research thinking about the evolution of fatigue. And of course, fatigue is really important if you're doing kind of physical activity. And they o many dimensions to what makes us exceptional an endurance. Because essentially most creatures, that's implied in your jo rogan chimpanze comparison, most creatures are adapted for strength and power and not for endurance. So chimpanzes are typical, right? They can sprint for about a hundred meters, and then they run out af gas. They rarely walk more than three or four kilometers a day, and when they do, they like exhausted and basely do nothing the next day. They're power animals, right? But we can run marathons and go hiking all day long and be fine the next day. And part of that comes ma classic trade off, because we have different muscle fibres that are good for producing power and strength. Those are type two muscle fibres, versus muscle fibres that are really good for durance that are metabless costly and morearobic. A those are type one, or slow twitch muscle fibres. And humans have a preponderance of of course, here's a lot of variation, and depends on muscle, muscle, but in general, the average human being is much, much more endurance adapted than power adapted. And because of the way those muscle fibres work, those lead to less fatigue. So its evolution, again, an evolutionary signal of selection for endurance and fatigue resistance. And their whole bunch of other features of the human physiology, which we think, again, play into that general argument. But of course, there's variation in humans. And no, people like usane bolt are more power adapted, speed adapted, and people like me are more endurance adapted. Andno, variation is the stuff of life, right? Humans are no exception.
