	- Every second brain needs organization.
	  
	  But organizing notes is tedious and takes up valuable time. So what's the solution?
	  
	  Organize as you write!
	  
	  Here's how I use the power of @logseq's outlines to organize and find back my notes effortlessly: ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1616177100721127425))

	- Structuring notes is simple in @logseq.
	  
	  All you need are:
	  â€¢ Outlines
	  â€¢ Links
	  
	  With Logseq, you can forget about files and folders. You only need to write your notes in lists/outlines and add [[wikilinks]].
	  
	  Here's why this works and what happens under the hood in Logseq: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1616177103468376064))
	- Everything is a parent-child relationship in @logseq.
	  
	  An example:
	  
	  â€¢ Block A is a parent block; B and C are children of A; block D is a grandchild of A.
	  
	  â€¢ Block B is a child of A, and itâ€™s in the same branch as blocks C and D.
	  
	  â€¢ Block C is a child of A and the parent of D.

	- Why does this matter?
	  
	  When a @logseq parent block/note contains a link, it applies to all children.
	  
	  In other words: every note/block gets all [[links]] and #tags that its parents have.
	  
	  Linking multiple notes and finding them back becomes super easy this way. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1616177115195641856))
	- As you can see, it really doesn't matter where you store your notes in @logseq.
	  
	  Finding your notes back is ridiculously easy as long as you group notes in lists (branches) and add links.
	  
	  Here's how I find code examples by filtering lists that contain specific links:

	- @logseq Do you want to harness the full power of Logseq's outlines and links?
	  
	  Then you should also learn about queries.
	  
	  Last summer, I ran a two-week cohort and taught everything I know about how to structure Logseq graphs.
