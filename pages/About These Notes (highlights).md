	- I usually begin by opening my writing inbox (A writing inbox for transient and incomplete notes) and flipping through those prompts and incomplete notes. If any strike me, I’ll draft Evergreen notes about them.  This may happen over multiple days: I may flesh out a note considerably, then run out of steam and leave it in my inbox to finish another day.
	- I’ll focus my attention on my primary creative projects and ask myself prompts like:what are the most important unknowns for this project?what new ideas am I excited about?what are the most interesting things I know about this project?
	- backlog of books and articles I’ve read but for which I haven’t yet written Evergreen notes
