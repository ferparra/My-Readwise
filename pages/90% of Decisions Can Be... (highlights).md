	- 90% of decisions can be made [[async]] instead of having to schedule a meeting.
	  
	  If you learn how to do this effectively, your team will love you for it.
	  
	  Here's my 5-step process: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1546509702476861441))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ Identify key people
	  
	  Every decision should ideally have:
	  
	  1 decision maker
	  <5 people to provide input
	  
	  You don't want to have too many cooks in the kitchen. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1546509705563889665))
	- 2/ Set context
	  
	  The decision maker should start an async thread or decision doc with:
	  
	  1.  Background
	  2.  List of options with pros and cons
	  3.  Recommended option
	  
	  Nobody has time to read your shit so the above should be as concise as possible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1546509708344770560))
	- 3/ Use one channel
	  
	  Pick one channel or doc for people to provide input.
	  
	  Avoid starting a bunch of separate threads and then playing a game of telephone to figure out who said what. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1546509710987124736))
	- 4/ Number your points
	  
	  Encourage people to provide input in a list format for easy readability.
	  
	  Use numbered lists vs. bullets to make it easier for people to respond ("e.g., I agree with #1") ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1546509714363539462))
	- 5/ Push for a decision
	  
	  When it looks like people are reaching alignment, the decision maker should push for consensus:
	  
	  "It sounds like people prefer #1, any strong objections to moving forward?"
	  
	  Once confirmed, share the decision far and wide so everyone is on the same page. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1546509717324718080))
	- 6/ BONUS: Know when a meeting is needed
	  
	  Usually it's when:
	  
	  1.  A decision has alot of ambiguity
	  2.  A decision is a one way door (hard to reverse once made)
	  3.  Your decision doc or thread looks like people threw up all over it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1546509720218849280))
	- 7/ To recap, here's how you can make better decisions async:
	  
	  1.  Identify key people
	  2.  Set [[context]]
	  3.  Use one channel
	  4.  Number your points
	  5.  Push for a decision
	  
	  6. Know when a meeting is needed ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1546509723041558528))
