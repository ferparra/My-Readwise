	  Over the moon, over the moon, the whole thing. Cloud nine. We're so high right now. And that's the kind of temptation.

	  It just makes sense to think those dreams must be symbolic too. In other words, we have what one researcher calls a waking state bias. So it lures us into putting more into the dream that's there. Going back to that hypothetical, if I have 150 of your dreams, I think I could know a lot about you. A whole lot. When I know something you don't know, I don't think so. What I know is what I would learn from you, if I could sit down with you and say, I would like to have an anonymous interview with you for research purposes, I wish answers honestly as you can. And I ask you what your feelings are towards your mother, what your feelings are towards your two sisters. What are some of your regrets? What are some of the things you worry about? I think that I would then learn from that interview what I've already learned from your dream. If I wanted to know what I can learn from your dreams, I think I would just interview you for an hour in an anonymous, honest interview. That means that dreams have meaning. Dreams have personal meaning. Occasionally they'll have cultural meaning. For example, in societies that are hunting and gathering societies, they dream more of animals, lo and behold. That's a cultural kind of difference. ([TimeÂ 0:09:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d3b827da-db00-4f62-a429-b4e0e0d82b0e))
