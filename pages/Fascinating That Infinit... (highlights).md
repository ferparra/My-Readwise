	- Fascinating that infinitely complex systems can be constructed from ONE key component. Examples:

	- When I was designing a debugger I figured that you could construct it from one operation: STEP_IN which returns stack and other info. Then everything else could be on top of that. E.g STEP_OVER is simply a series of STEP_IN until the stack is length is equal to the starting point ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1474899691783409665))
	- Itâ€™s fun to design systems by boiling it down to one thing. But it might not be practical (eg slow). Nonetheless it gives you a better grasp on the problem. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1474900137096847360))
	- The universe seems to have a bias for conceptually simple things, despite messy implementations. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1474902021291462659))
	- This is a good example and reminds of how LISP is *mostly* constructed out of functions. Even basic operations, lists, etc can be implemented using functions https://t.co/731nRRRSRB ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1474904257841098753))
