	- #TinyTableauTip If you want to create a (Fixed) LOD calculation, as of @tableau 2021.1, you can drag a measure on top of a dimension (hold in CTRL for Windows) and Tableau automagically creates a FIXED LOD for you which you can use.

	- #TinyTableauTip If you have missing data from a date period in @tableau, right-click on the data pill and select "Show Missing Values" to make sure it pops out that there is no data recorded for the specific period.

	- #TinyTableauTip 
	  If you have two dimensions that you would like to put on color, you can't drag them individually on the marks card, as the last will replace the first. 
	  1: drag both dim on Color at once
	  2: drag dim #2 on detail, and change from Detail to Color on the icons
