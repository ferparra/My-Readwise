	- Learning physical skills, such as playing the
	  piano, is a type of [[project management]]. [[Project management]] consists of:
	  defining the objective of the project, estimating how much time and effort will
	  be required, determining whether such resources are available, knowing exactly
	  how the project will end, and then creating a [[plan of action]].
	- Estimating the time it takes to finish the project is often the most difficult
	  part. It is useful to classify projects as short term or long term: skills that
	  can be learned in a few days, or those that require a good fraction of a
	  lifetime to learn.
