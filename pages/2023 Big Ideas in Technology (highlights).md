	- The Immediate Value of AI Assist
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* AI is helping humans be more productive and efficient, and this is leading to more nearterm value for businesses., * There are still some steps that need to be taken before AI can create perfect pitches or videos, but these are steps that are already being taken.)

	  Yeah, first of all, I love how you put that fault tolerance.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I think that's notably different from other areas where the bar is incredibly high. Autonomous vehicles would be a good example of that. The stakes are the highest, right? People die if the product isn't right. And as a result, the process of getting there may take a bit longer. On the other hand, I believe that potential workflow applications of AI are enormous and incredibly near-term. And a lot of that is due to this, again, more tolerance for fault. And I think a lot of these workflows are actually oriented around AI assist. So in other words, where AI is making the human more productive, but humans still stay in the loop. And as a result, they can be deployed immediately.

	  I think coding has been pretty salient recently.

	  I've even heard developers say that they can't work without it. But that's not to say that developers are using AI and saying, hey, create this app, soup to nuts. That may be in the future, in the very near future. But today, what developers are doing are using it to code complete, right? And figuring out how they can make their process, especially the repentance parts of their job, just way more efficient and faster. And we always talk about finding new solutions that are 10x plus better. And that's arrived in that arena. There's so many use cases we could touch on. But ones that we've seen lately that have been mind-blowingly good. Video editing with companies like Runway really come to mind. This has the potential to replace software that's been around for 30 years. Pitch editing and pitch creation. The list really goes on. But I think the key theme here, to your point on immediate value, really centers around how AI is assisting the human and making them more productive and efficient. And then we'll slowly get to the idea that, hey, we can actually make a perfect picture. We can actually make a perfect pitch deck that reflects exactly what we want. We can code it out that is exactly what we want. And we can edit a video soup to nuts without humans in the loop.

	  But until then, I think the intermediate step has already been pretty groundbreaking. ([TimeÂ 1:01:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c0085463-e467-451f-a707-125a0f721e15))
