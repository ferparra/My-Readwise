	- Build a Google-like search for your data in 30 mins. 
	  
	  Large Language Models have completely changed the search landscape making semantic search accessible and affordable for all.

	- Semantic Search sandbox by Cohere
	  
	  Cohere's API makes it really easy for you to search and find relevant information from your data. 
	  
	  It is the part of the sandbox project by Cohere that aims to make building and deploying LLM-powered apps a piece of cake. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Saboo_Shubham_/status/1589291547111170049))
	- How does it work?
	  
	  Any kind of search application has to perform two important tasks:
	- Indexing
	  
	  First we break down the input text into a series of paragraphs, storing the addresses in the input into a list and generating a vector embedding for each paragraph using "co.embed".

	- Query
	  
	  We can query our index by embedding the text query and finding the paragraphs in the source text which have the closest match using some measure of vector similarity like cosine similarity.

	- Where can you use this?
	  
	  To make the information discoverable in your internal sources like technical documentation, internal wiki's where the answer to a given question is likely to be given by a concrete paragraph in the text. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Saboo_Shubham_/status/1589291654221021184))
