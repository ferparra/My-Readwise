	- Where does YIELD in crypto come from?
	  
	  It's 2021.
	  üò° $1 in Chase earns 0.05% APY.
	  üò≤ 1 UST in Anchor earns 20% APY!
	  ü§Ø 1 UST in a market-neutral fund running 50x levered BTC contango trades earns >300% APY!
	  
	  How are crypto yields SO DAMN HIGH, and is this sustainable? üßµ.

	- 1/ Yield in crypto comes from 4 main sources
	  
	  a. demand for leverage (e.g. basis trading)
	  b. risk premia (e.g. options writing)
	  c. protocol revenue (e.g. staking, LP)
	  d. payment-in-kind (e.g. token rewards)
	  
	  For each, let's explore:
	- 2/ But first, some stats...
	  
	  Comparing lending yields from USDC (up to 8%+) vs. USD (3.25% prime rate). üëá

	- 3/ Comparing staking yields for some of the highest-yielding legitimate protocols.

	- Ok let's get started. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1459942831120805890))
	- 5/ Demand for leverage
	  
	  Why do traders use leverage?
	  1. asymmetrical directional bets
	  2. market neutral strategies
	  3. capital efficiency
	  
	  Degen retail traders & insiders do 1. But their capital base is small, so net contribution to demand pressure is small.
	  
	  Funds do 2 & 3.
	  Why? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1459942831926112257))
	- Market neutral strategies have no directional exposure e.g.
	- Think of it this way: would you rather be naked long BTC betting on +20% next month, or levered 5x on +4% BTC perp funding rates?
	  
	  The levered basis trade clearly has better Sharpe, aka risk-adjusted returns. So given a choice, institutions/MMs would always choose the latter. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1459942835843518468))
	- Is demand for leverage sustainable?
	  
	  Yes.
	  But it could fluctuate.
	  
	  As long as market-neutral strategies continue to print (+) ROI, MMs will continue to demand leverage to juice up those trades.
	  
	  However, if a crypto winter strikes & overall trading activities drop, so may demand. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1459942836841836546))
	- 6/ Risk premia
	  
	  This ‚òÇÔ∏è term breaks down into:
	- "Structured products" like @ribbonfinance and @Katana_HQ transfer risk premia:
	- The most common strategy is the covered call.
	  e.g. buy ETH spot, sell Jan22 ETH $7K calls
	  
	  Performance depends on market conditions.
	- But what about when markets go... down?
	  
	  Turns out selling vol doesn't *always* return positive yield. Not in crypto; not in tradfi.
	  
	  Shocker.üò≤

	- Is yield from selling options sustainable?
	  
	  In a smooth steady bull-run, yes.
	  In a high-vol market reversal, no.
	  
	  In other words, while on average IV > historical vol, u won't always make money thetaganging. Choose the right portfolio manager who knows how to handle beta risk. ü§î ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1459942847088508936))
	- 7/ Protocol Revenue
	  i.e. when actual cashflows generated from activity on the protocol is used to pay stakeholder yield
	  
	  This further breaks down into:
	- Staking example:
	  
	  On the Ethereum network, staking means locking up 32 ETH to run validator software.
	  
	  But say u only have 4 ETH. So you enter into a pool where your contribution & claim to profits is 1/8.
	  
	  If the validator pool earns 2 ETH, u earn 0.25 ETH or 6.25% personal APY. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1459942848950779906))
	- LP example:
	  
	  Say u want to provide liquidity into an ETH-USDC swap pool on Uniswap. Say the total market cap is $295M and you provide another $5M.
	  
	  The protocol collects 0.3% fee from total trading volumes. Say it earns $12M in a year.
	  
	  Your profit: 5/300*12M = $200K (4% APY). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1459942849898684416))
	- Is yield earned from protocol revenue sustainable?
	  
	  Yes.
	  But it could fluctuate.
	  
	  Again, protocol revenue (both staking & LP) is directly proportional to transaction volumes.
	  
	  So if a crypto winter strikes & overall trading activity drops, so will validator rewards & LP fees. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1459942850838228992))
	- 8/ PIK (payment in kind, i.e. token rewards)
	  
	  Swap protocols today often issue native governance tokens (on top of protocol fees) to sweeten their deal for LPs.
	  
	  e.g. 
	  @CurveFinance issues $CRV
	  @Bancor issues $BNT
	  
	  When these tokens appreciate, it's like holding venture equity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1459942851794518020))
	- Is yield from PIK sustainable?
	  
	  No.
	  Sorry.
	  
	  I mean I get it. In the early days u should reward early users for helping to bootstrap the network.
	  
	  But in the terminal state most token holders will not be LPs. Continued issuance of LP rewards will just dilute existing stakeholders. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1459942852830531587))
	- 9/ Summary
	  
	  Crypto yields feel insanely high, propped up by the current bull run. They're sustainable as long as capital inflows & QE continue (because what's the alternative, JPow?)
	  
	  The 4 sources of yield:
