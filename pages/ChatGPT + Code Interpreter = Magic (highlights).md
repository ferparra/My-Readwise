	- Beside generating code, *Code Interpreter* (CI) can analyze the output and use it in another function. This means that you can string together different sections of code, taking the output of one and feeding it to another. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwg9ak4m089jbj3tdjwh8n8c))
	- Using the Matplotlib library I was able to get ChatGPT to make a simulation of the orbits of the inner planets and save it as a gif. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwgxm302z654ck9xk6wst29c))

		- **Note**: OpenAI has developed plugins for its ChatGPT conversational AI tool, including a Code Interpreter plugin that can generate code, run code, upload and download files, and evaluate the output. The Code Interpreter works with Python and a small selection of libraries, allowing users to do development inside ChatGPT without leaving the UI. Examples of experiments include generating a Shepard tone, creating music from Conway's Game of Life, generating a QR code, and simulating the orbits of planets. Through this plugin, ChatGPT has become a powerful tool for both coding and research.
