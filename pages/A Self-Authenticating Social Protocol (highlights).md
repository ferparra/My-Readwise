	- An open and durable decentralized protocol for public conversations can allow users a choice in their experience, creators control over their relationships with their audience, and developers freedom to innovate without permission from a platform.
	- Self-sovereign identity is based on having cryptographic identifiers for users. Control of an account is proved by a cryptographic signature from a user, rather than an entry in a database keeping track of logins.
	- Verifiable computation uses cryptographic proofs to allow observers to verify that a computation was performed correctly without having to run it themselves.
	- Aggregators in a self-authenticating network can host data on behalf of smaller providers without reducing trust in the data's authenticity.
