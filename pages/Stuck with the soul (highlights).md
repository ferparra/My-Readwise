document_note:: The soul is a concept that has been present in many cultures and beliefs, and is seen as an immaterial part of an individual that exists beyond the physical body. It is often seen as a metaphor for consciousness, deeper beliefs and desires, as well as a source of life. Belief in the soul is widespread, due to its immateriality and the promise of eternal life it brings, and it is also used by religious institutions as a way to control their followers. Despite arguments against the existence of souls, it is likely that belief in them will continue due to their connection to the human psyche.

	- Jewish doctrine says almost nothing about the soul. ‘[T]here is no way on earth,’ wrote the influential Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides, ‘that we can comprehend or know it.’ This [agnostic attitude](https://aeon.co/essays/neither-philosophy-nor-religion-can-contain-maimonides) is consistent with Judaism’s lack of specificity regarding the afterlife generally and of heaven and hell in particular. By contrast, Christianity and Islam are clear when it comes to the soul, conceiving it as immaterial as well as immortal, the two perspectives being, as it were, soulmates. Although Islam has a variety of views when it comes to the soul, there is greater diversity within Christianity – between Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox conceptions – and also within Protestantism, ranging from evangelical fundamentalism to the more relaxed and philosophical approaches of modern-day Quakers and Unitarians.

		- **Note**: Jewish teaching does not say much about the soul. Moses Maimonides, a famous Jewish philosopher, said that there is no way for us to understand or know the soul. This means that Judaism does not talk much about what happens to us after we die, or about heaven and hell. Christianity and Islam have very clear beliefs about the soul, believing that it is something that cannot be seen and never dies. Even within these religions there are different views about the soul. For example, some people believe in fundamentalist ideas about the soul, while others have a more relaxed or philosophical view.
