document_note:: This book explores the complexities of open source software and how individual developers need to filter and curate interactions in order to manage their code. It provides a new framework for thinking about open source and examines the shift from collaborative online communities to solo creators, and how platforms facilitate this shift. It also looks at the roles of maintainers and contributors, the need to refactor code, and the costs of maintenance. Finally, it examines the value of content in terms of production and distribution.
