category:: #articles
url:: https://blas.com/superthinking/
document_note:: This book provides an overview of mental models, such as arguing from first principles, de-risking, premature optimization, the top idea in your mind, local vs global optimum, the consequence-conviction matrix, resonant frequency, the OODA loop, and heat-seeking missiles. It provides examples and explains how these models can be used to become an effective thinker and decision-maker.

- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Feb 21st, 2023]]
	- Arguing from first principles - you must understand the core, fundamental principles if you are going to be an effective thinker. A first principle is an assumption that cannot be deduced any further ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntbayhf0a5zg5f0tj3n4kj))
		- **Note**: Arguing from first principles is a method of thinking which requires one to understand the fundamental concepts underlying a problem, in order to be an effective thinker. A first principle is an assumption that is taken to be true and cannot be broken down further.
	- De-risking - what steps can you take, what can you think through and control that would lower the risk? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntd4pvgq4qjztmxwqbmenq))
		- **Tags**: #[[risk]]
		- **Note**: De-risking is the process of taking steps to reduce the risk of a situation. This involves thinking through and controlling the various factors that might create a risk, so that one can confidently move forward with a plan.
	- Premature optimization - it is better to iterate, take small steps and adapt and evolve as the situation unfolds rather than come up with grand plans and rigid blueprints ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntbqprxd2w4ta6q7tdhvzx))
		- **Tags**: #[[experimentation]]
		- **Note**: The text advises against "premature optimization," which is when people come up with overly complex plans and rigid blueprints before they have enough information. Instead, it suggests iterating, taking small steps, and adapting and evolving as the situation progresses.
	- The top idea in your mind - be very aware of what you're thinking about since this shapes and colors what you see and how you behave. [Paul Graham talks about this best](http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntctty3g80q0jcgx970z4h))
		- **Note**: Paul Graham suggests that the most important thing to be aware of is the top idea in your mind, as it will influence what you see and how you behave.
	- Opportunity cost - the value you're giving up by pursuing one thing rather than another ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntca6zynbajx4344aq3zbq))
		- **Tags**: #[[opportunity cost]]
		- **Note**: Opportunity cost is the concept that when making a decision, the potential value of an alternative option must also be considered. It is the value of the most desirable option that is sacrificed when a different one is chosen.
	- Local vs. Global optimum - your mindset and time horizon very much determine how you act. Something that makes sense locally can be harmful globally ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntdnn04b1mvjq6nq7safwp))
		- **Note**: The Local vs. Global Optimum model emphasizes that our mindset and time horizon can have a significant impact on our decisions and actions. While a decision may appear to make sense in the short-term, it can have negative consequences in the long-term. This model highlights the importance of considering the global implications of decisions before making them.
	- Consequence-Conviction Matrix - how small/large are the consequences and how much conviction do you have? Large consequences and low conviction, take your time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsnte7cvpwvwqzez3jedmwmw))
		- **Note**: The Consequence-Conviction Matrix is a tool used to assess a situation and determine the best course of action. It involves considering the size of the consequences of an action and the level of conviction held for it. If the consequences are large and the conviction is low, it is best to take more time to consider the action and make an informed decision.
	- Resonant Frequency - a phenomenon that only occurs when the frequency at which a force is periodically applied is equal or near equal to one of the natural frequencies on which it acts. As leaders and teammates, we try to get on the same frequency as our team, lowering friction and getting better results ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntenz3gh8d9vsnncdp8rch))
		- **Note**: Resonant Frequency is a phenomenon that occurs when the frequency at which a force is applied matches or is close to one of the natural frequencies of the system. It can be utilized by leaders and teammates to align themselves with their team and thereby reduce friction and improve results.
	- OODA Loop - John Boyd's assessment protocol - Observe, Orient, Decide, Act ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntf13k84aqc5thtygczhgd))
		- **Note**: The OODA Loop is a decision-making process developed by John Boyd, which involves four distinct steps: Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. This protocol is designed to help individuals make decisions quickly and effectively in rapidly changing environments.
	- Heat-seeking missiles - leaders should learn from heat-seeking missiles and aim to be in the "hottest" areas - the areas with the most friction ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntfqyrerpp365aavrm293y))
		- **Tags**: #[[leadership]]
		- **Note**: This text suggests that leaders should seek out challenging and difficult situations and take advantage of them, as this is where the most learning and growth opportunities lie. Heat-seeking missiles are used as an analogy to illustrate the idea of leaders proactively seeking out difficult and demanding areas in order to become more successful and gain more knowledge.
