document_note:: Impact Networks are intentional connections between individuals and organizations for collective action and learning. They are based on the idea that people can solve simple issues, organizations can solve complicated issues, and networks are needed for complex issues. Network coordinators are responsible for coordinating people, resources, and skills to achieve a shared vision and address complex challenges. Network leadership is more inclusive, diverse, and open than in an organization, and there are four distinct roles of network weavers: connectors, project coordinators, network facilitators, and network guardians. Networks should promote power distribution, transparency, and self-directed learning. To promote network health, there should be network activity, strength of connectivity, coherence and collaboration, shared purpose, relationships of trust, self-organization, emergence, and dynamic change.
