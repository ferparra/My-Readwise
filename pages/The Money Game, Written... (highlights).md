	- The Money Game, written George Goodman under the pseudonym 'Adam Smith', is one of my favorite books about investing, its psychology, and the mindset of professional money managers. The introduction alone is full of timeless quotes about the nature of the game.

	- "This is a book about image and reality and identity and anxiety and money. If that doesn’t scare you off, nothing will." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1533102016037326849))
	- "A fund manager will tell another fund manager the innermost state of his emotions, the condition of his marriage, and even his purchases and sales, but he will not tell a broker or a magazine or any outsider who is likely not to understand him completely."

	- "It has taken me years to unlearn everything I was taught"
	  
	  "Most of what has been written about the market tells you the way it ought to be, and the successful investors I know do not hold to the way it ought to be, they simply go with what is."

	- "We are taught that money is A Very Serious Business"
	  
	  Keynes: "The game of professional investment is intolerably boring to anyone who is exempt from the gambling instinct; whilst he who has it must pay to this propensity the appropriate toll."

	- The irony: most people should not be managing their own money.
	  
	  "But if you have your money managed for you, then you are not really interested, or at least the Game element—with that propensity to be paid for—does not attract you."

	- "If you are a successful Game player, it can be a fascinating, consuming, totally absorbing experience, in fact it has to be. If it is not totally absorbing, you are not likely to be among the most successful, because you are competing with those who do find it so absorbing." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1533102031006846977))
	- Which is why people don't retire once they are rich.
	  
	  "The houses and the art are all still there, but the players have gone back to the Game."
	  
	  "The Game is more fun."

	- "It probably does not make you a better person, and I am not sure it does any good for humanity; the best you can say is what Samuel Johnson said, that no man is so harmlessly occupied as when he is making money." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1533102036262215680))
	- "This is a money game and money is the way we keep score. But the real object of the Game is the playing of the Game itself. For the true players, you could take all the trophies away and substitute plastic beads; as long as there is a way to keep score, they will play." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1533102037860331521))
	- "Active investors do not pursue bonds (except convertibles) and preferreds (except convertibles). It isn’t that one can’t make money with these instruments, it’s that they lack romance enough to be part of the game; they are boring."

	- "Sometimes illusions are more comfortable than reality, but there is no reason to be discomfited by facing the gambling instinct that saves the stock market from being a bore. Once it is acknowledged we can “pay to this propensity the appropriate toll” and proceed with reality."
