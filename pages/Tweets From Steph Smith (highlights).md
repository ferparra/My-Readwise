	- It was super simple to build:
	  
	  1. Add a formula based on date added (Notion auto pulls)
	  2. If ‚úÖ: done. If ‚ùå & within 30 days: pending. If ‚ùå & NOT within 30 days: expired
	  3. In the view I see daily, I only see pending

	- In the sea of content out there, I know I'm not the only one to have a never-ending list of articles to read or pods to listen to.
	  
	  That's why I created an "expiring todo" list.
	  
	  For "nice to haves", if I don't get to them within 30 days, they automatically disappear! üí´ https://t.co/B6ktTA49ok ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1423774842935922692))
