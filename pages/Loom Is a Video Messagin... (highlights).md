- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 18th, 2022]]
	- Loom is a video messaging startup valued at more than $325 million today. 
	  
	  In 2015 it was a usability testing app with no traction. 
	  
	  This is a story about taking a company through a dark period and teammates sticking together. üëá https://t.co/mQJB3OzWHf ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamDeBrule/status/1382428857492410368))
	- Co-founder Vinay Hiremath describes Loom's early days as "simultaneously the greatest source of joy and crushing anxiety" of his life:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Opentest, their original product, wasn‚Äôt working
	  ‚Ä¢ The founders maxed out their credit cards
	  ‚Ä¢ They pivoted 4-5 times in 7 months ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamDeBrule/status/1382428858905894912))
	- Loom started as a different product 
	  
	  Co-founders Joe Thomas, Vinay Hiremath, and Shahed Khan jumped into the domain of user testing after a 30 minute meeting. 
	  
	  They called it Opentest. 
	  
	  It started as a network of their ‚Äúexpert‚Äù friends giving companies product feedback. https://t.co/4qMbSRKtQ0 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamDeBrule/status/1382428861107904513))
	- The team used their own money to fund the company
	  
	  But it wasn‚Äôt catching on. 
	  
	  Opentest‚Äôs customers didn‚Äôt want feedback from the founders‚Äô friends. 
	  
	  The founders maxed out credit cards to keep the company alive. 
	  
	  They were 2 weeks away from giving up and looking for new jobs. https://t.co/AgwUoxUvqL ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamDeBrule/status/1382428864723357697))
	- But @vhmth had thick skin and a chip on his shoulder from childhood 
	  
	  He grew up in an Illinois farmtown.
	  
	  People flew Confederate flags on their trucks. 
	  
	  They told him that "brown people need to stay in their place." 
	  
	  He didn‚Äôt give up.

	- The team stuck together because of trust and an equal commitment to success
	  
	  They worked 16 hours a day (Vinay does *not* recommend this as blanket advice!) 
	  
	  They had weekly venting sessions. 
	  
	  They said what they didn‚Äôt like about each other. 
	  
	  They celebrated wins. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamDeBrule/status/1382428867940347905))
	- They pivoted the company 4-5 times instead of quitting
	  
	  One of the pivots? 
	  
	  An extension that helped people record feedback videos showing their screen and face. 
	  
	  They called it Openvid. https://t.co/3CwhNLWKPb ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamDeBrule/status/1382428870498951170))
	- They thought they were onto something 
	  
	  A user sent in a video screaming at his screen. He said it was a ‚Äúperfect way to express disappointment‚Äù with a co-worker
	  
	  Internet speeds were increasing around the world
	  
	  They thought work would become more distributed 
	  
	  This was in 2016. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamDeBrule/status/1382428872285691906))
	- They launched Openvid on @ProductHunt. 
	  
	  They grew from 0 to 10,000+ users in 3 months. 
	  
	  Christoph Janz and the team @PointNineCap invested in the company, now called Loom. https://t.co/4UCbS0alYy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamDeBrule/status/1382428876559699971))
	- The process of building anything new is scary 
	  
	  But like Vinay said to @figelwump,
	  
	  ‚ÄúYou have to do the thing that scares the shit out of you for the upside. 
	  
	  There might be a downside before the upside. 
	  
	  And you have to be okay with that.‚Äù
