	- Kent Beck came up with his four rules of simple design while he
	  was developing ExtremeProgramming in the late 1990's. I express
	  them like this. [1]
	  
	  
	  Passes the tests
	  
	  Reveals intention
	  
	  No duplication
	  
	  Fewest elements
	- whatever else you
	  do with the software, the primary aim is that it works as
	  intended and tests are there to ensure that happens
	- "Reveals intention" is Kent's way of saying the code
	  should be easy to understand
	- eliminating
	  duplication is a powerful way to drive out good designs
