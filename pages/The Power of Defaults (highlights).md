document_note:: This essay analyzes the concept of network effects, which occur when the value of a product or service is subject to the number of users. It looks at the examples of Facebook, Google, and Apple and how they have used network effects to achieve success. It also examines the different types of network effects and how they are used to create defensibility and growth. Finally, it discusses intersubjective realities and how they can be used to create powerful moats for businesses.

	- One of the [most cited](https://www.nfx.com/post/network-effects-bible/) [types](https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/network-effects_critical-mass/) [of](https://a16z.com/2018/12/13/network-effects-dynamics-in-practice/) [moats](https://breadcrumb.vc/) is the concept of [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect). Network effects occur when the value of a product or service is subject to the number of users. A positive network effect means that a product or service becomes more valuable to its users as more people use it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqkse1k9cp0z9meemkqrrfx))

	- **Direct network effects** – as the name suggests – occur when the number of users has a direct impact on the value of a product. A telephone, for example, is worthless if you are the only person who owns one. But with every additional user who joins the telephone network, the number of people you can have a conversation with goes up and therefore the overall value of a telephone increases. The same dynamic is true for chat apps, social networks and p2p payment systems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqkve7vejmkcejbzk5bp0x0))

	- **Indirect network effects** are a little more complicated. They occur in two-sided (or multi-sided) products where the size of one user group affects how valuable the product is to another user group. Operating systems are an often cited example here: The more users an OS has, the more attractive it becomes for developers. More developers and apps, on the other hand, make the platform more valuable for users, thereby generating a positive feedback loop between the two sides.

	- **Switching costs** describe how difficult or expensive it is for a user to switch from one product to another, whereas **multihoming costs** explain how easy or likely it is to use multiple competing networks simultaneously.

	- If you want to understand the power dynamics between different platforms, aggregators and other players in a tech ecosystem, it’s better to look at them as a **vertical stack with different layers**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqkxd76qzjyv18n5ayb65z6))
	- On each layer of the stack, companies are trying to create value and to capture value. The lowest layers of the stack are typically the most powerful. If you are able to take control of a layer, you can dictate the terms of most of the value creation and value capture that is happening in the layers above you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqkxvf4717nhxjx3mh0ffbr))
	- The base layer is the final interface between the stack and the end user – which is typically an operating system tied to a piece of hardware. This is why atom-based network effects are so powerful: They help companies gain control of the most powerful layer of the stack.

	- **Becoming the default browser homepage became Google’s actual moat.** There can only be one homepage (no multihoming) and users are typically too lazy to change it (friction = switching costs). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqkyx8q9rvy24sbm3txza11))

	- A company can have multiple sources of data, but it can’t have multiple sources of truth. **There is no multihoming on the truth layer.** You need a *single* source of truth. A default. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqm04r9apdrg11rj2c443xc))
