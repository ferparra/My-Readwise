	- The only thing surprising about the freight market slowdown is the speed at which its unfolding. The supply chain "bullwhip effect" is both predictable and was expected. The surge of inventories and declining freight costs/capacity imbalances will be deflationary. 1/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FreightAlley/status/1513145199802920972))

	- The bullwhip effect is something any supply chain 101 student would learn about - the idea that upstream providers over produce in reaction to a one-time demand shock. 2/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FreightAlley/status/1513145200733995010))
	- The war and oil prices likely shocked the consumer into a spending pullback on physical goods - at the very same time that inventories were pilling up. And without demand, you don't need to move anything quickly. 3/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FreightAlley/status/1513145201652645896))
	- Railroads move products slower, including intermodal (containerized freight on the rails). Its currently 21% cheaper to move a container of freight on intermodal than it is through a truck (door to door) - an all time high savings high. Chart: cost delta intermodal vs. truck. 4/

	- This chart shows the volume differences between intermodal and truck volumes. Intermodal is holding its own, truck volumes are slowing. 5/

	- This is all good for consumers - prices for freight will come down. Supply chain bottlenecks will ease. Inventory shortages are now gluts and will likely result in discounts, not increases. This is a late stage supply chain correction. 6/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FreightAlley/status/1513145204676648968))
	- What is happening in China will system-wide slowdowns will force supply chain executives in America to reevaluate their sourcing strategy (if not already). China is becoming far too unpredictable and unstable as a supplier. Companies can take this breather to catch up. 7/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FreightAlley/status/1513145205561696266))
	- Lots to be bullish about. The "bullwhip correction" will be a different kind of headache than we've had to deal with for the past two years - but the good news is the market is correcting and things are "normalizing" as least as supply chains are concerned. end.
