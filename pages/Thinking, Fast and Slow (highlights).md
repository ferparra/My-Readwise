document_note:: In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman divides decision making into our intuitions (System 1) and our slower, more rational side (System 2). He offers tips and techniques to avoiding psychological fallacies when making decisions. He also emphasizes the importance of recognizing the role of chance, overconfidence, and the illusion of understanding when making decisions. He further explains the effects of the availability heuristic, halo effect, priming, and preference reversals when making decisions. He also emphasizes the importance of remembering that nothing in life is as important as it seems when you are thinking about it, as well as remembering to take the duration of events into account and to judge decisions by how they were made and not just how they turned out.

- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Feb 13th, 2023]]
	- People are intuitively poor statisticians ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs51rm15418hze1npatgrkas))
	- **Availability heuristic** - people biased because of heuristics. Most obvious and prevalent example pops up first (shark attacks although very rare) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs51rrez6v81cpa36t260e41))
	- **Resemblance and recall often used but don't forget to also think about statistics.** Farmer and librarian example where describe somebody shy and think librarian but in fact many more farmers than librarians in the world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs51snp0tf5hjypn9xfzedwk))
	- **Affect heuristic** - make decision based on gut with little use of reason or intellect.
	  
	  1.  **Fast thinking uses heuristics, intuition and perception/memory and the vast majority of our decisions are made using this systems (but maybe they shouldn't be...)**
	  2.  **Slow thinking based on reason, deliberate thought** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs51t43na396xxq3b7gw3zyv))
		- **Note**: 1. Fast thinking means making decisions quickly based on our feelings, without using too much thinking or understanding.
		  2. Slow thinking means taking our time and using reason and careful thinking before making decisions.
	- Setting for yourself certain risk policies will help alleviate some of the narrow framing issues and make decisions easier ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs51w2jjtnt2jbkxsr145n02))
		- **Tags**: #[[risk]] #[[decision making]]
	- In order to avoid hindsight bias, make decisions after very thorough thought or almost none ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs51wnecd00w54vystd1hw4b))
	- Pain and pleasure drives mostly everything. Understand that duration of plays a big role when deciding ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs51wwd0rb2nddjzzdvb9p7d))
	- Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs51x0mvbtbv1htnh4e8jtrd))
	- 2 selves - experiencing self and remembering self (keeps score and makes decisions)
	  
	  1.  Make sure to take duration of event into account when making decision
	  2.  **Start judging decisions by how they were made and not only how they turned out** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs51x9j6w1b1bpfmrc68zem4))
		- **Note**: "We all have two selves inside of us: the experiencing self and the remembering self. The remembering self keeps score and makes decisions. It's important to remember to think about how long something will last before making a decision. Instead of judging your decisions by how they turn out, it's better to judge them by how they were made."
	- The Lazy Controller
	  
	  •   If system 2 needed most people cannot walk at same time
	  •   Flow stems from a balance of both systems
	  •   When system 2 is busy we are more likely to fall to our impulses in system 1 (cheat on diet)
	  •   System 2 controls thoughts and behaviors
	  •   Overuse leads to ego depletion and giving up earlier and glucose levels drop
	  •   **People avoid cognitive effort and rely on their intuition too much**
	  •   **Cognitive control linked to intelligence (marshmallow study)**
	  •   **Rationality and intelligence should be separated** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs51ykdgpz9rfn6xqmd4tkp8))
		- **Note**: System 2 is the part of our brain that helps us to make good decisions and control our behaviors. If too much effort is put into it, people may become too tired and give up earlier, and their glucose levels might drop. People may try to avoid doing too much thinking and instead rely on their intuition. How well people are able to use their intelligence to make good decisions is linked to their cognitive control. Finally, we should remember that intelligence and rationality are two separate things.
	- The Associative Machine
	  
	  •   [[Cognition]] is embodied - think with body as well as brain
	  •   **Know ourselves much less than we think we do as we don't know the majority of our thoughts as they are [[subconscious]]**
	  •   We can be primed just by being exposed to words (old people words made people walk slower) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs51zm0gn7r0hqqte1ty29xs))
		- **Note**: The Associative Machine means that we use our bodies and brains to think. We don't know most of our thoughts because they are happening in our mind without us knowing. We can be affected by things we hear, like if we hear words related to old people, we might even start walking slower.
	- Cognitive Ease
	  
	  •   Certain questions (am I safe?) continually asked by system 1 to determine if extra cognitive effort from system 2 needed
	  •   Cognitively easy you are happy and casual
	  •   If have seen something before it will see and feel familiar making you recognize it and cognitively easier
	  •   **Ideas described with more complex words seen as less intelligent.** Use familiar words to describe you're ideas (rhymes often work best for people to remember)
	  •   **System 2, unless trained, will often inherently trust system 1**
	  •   Mood affects system 1 - happier people react more accurately and quicker to intuition experiments
	  •   Exposure effect - familiarity breeds liking ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs520rnc6db6k35ny02ksjgs))
		- **Note**: "System 1 and System 2 are two parts of our brain. System 1 is like our gut feeling and it helps us recognize things we have seen before and feel safe. System 2 is like our thinking brain and it helps us make decisions. When something is familiar or easy to understand, we usually trust System 1 more. That means if something is described with simple words, we are more likely to believe it. But if something is described with complex words, we might not understand it as easily and not believe it. Also, when we are in a good mood, System 1 helps us make better decisions."
	- Norms, Surprises or Causes
	  
	  •   **System 1's goal is to update your view of the world around you**
	  •   Surprises help form world around you and prime you for what to anticipate
	  •   **Violations of normality are detected extremely quickly**
	  •   We often assign causes to events even if no real cause
	  •   Can say that we "see" causality like we see color
	  •   **People often use causal thinking when statistical thinking should be used** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs521wgzb10spgpjdp9p0h27))
		- **Note**: System 1 is like a machine that helps us understand the world around us. Surprises help us notice and remember what is important. We notice when things don't happen like they usually do. We often think that something caused an event even if there isn't really a reason. We think in terms of cause and effect, like we can see colors. People sometimes think that something is the cause of something else when really it's just a coincidence. We should think using statistics instead of cause and effect.
	- A Machine for Jumping to Conclusions
	  
	  •   System 2 in charge if detecting lies and 1 in believing
	  •   People believe weak arguments more when tired
	  •   [Halo effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect)- tendency to like everything about a person if you like one aspect
	  •   Often forget that there is more than what we see. "What we is is all there is" fallacy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52391eedt9xhwtn0pspq99))
		- **Note**: System 2 is in charge of figuring out if someone is telling the truth or lying, while System 1 is in charge of believing what people say. When people are tired, they are more likely to believe weak arguments. The halo effect is when you like everything about a person if you like one thing about them. People sometimes forget that there is more to a situation than what they can see. This is called the "what we see is all there is" fallacy.
	- The Law Of Small Numbers
	  
	  •   Statistical sampling can give strange results when using small numbers - small counties with high cancer incidents can be caused just by sampling effects
	  •   Be careful with assigning causality with truly random events
	  •   No such thing as a hot hand in basketball because it is truly random
	  •   **Pay more attention to messages than the content of their reliability** (sample size too small), jump to conclusions and some things have to cause - simply random ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs524r11zp5qhjaj9ja5ndng))
		- **Tags**: #[[sampling]]
		- **Note**: The Law Of Small Numbers means that if you have only a few pieces of information it can lead to strange conclusions. For example, if you look at a small county and see that it has a high rate of cancer, it might be because you don't have enough information to know why. It could be a random event and not caused by anything else. This means that we should not assume that things always have a cause, they could just be random. We should be careful not to jump to conclusions and pay more attention to the information we have and not just the messages it is sending.
	- Anchors
	  
	  •   Using a number as a base, or anchor, when asked to answer something else that may be completely unrelated
	  •   **Anchoring has a huge effect on us and can be found everywhere. In order to get past it, find reasons as to why the anchor is wrong**
	  •   **Priming** - our thoughts and behaviors are affected much more by our environment and other things we are exposed to than we care to admit ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5260esaca33f88vzwdytb4))
		- **Tags**: #[[priming]]
		- **Note**: Anchors are like starting points. For example, if someone asks you to guess how many people are in a room and you don't know, you could use an anchor—like 5—to give yourself a starting point. Anchoring has a big influence on us. To avoid it, try to figure out why the anchor might be wrong. Priming is when our environment or things we see around us can change our thoughts and behavior, often without us even noticing.
	- Science of Availability
	  
	  •   Availability heuristic - the ease which examples come to mind
	  •   Ease with which instances come to mind is a system 1 heuristic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs527ddac3pd91dh2bd4cx0k))
		- **Note**: The science of availability is when you think about things that are easily remembered. It is like a shortcut in your brain that helps you remember things quickly.
	- Availability, Emotion and Risk
	  
	  •   More recent a disaster struck, more diligent people are but as memory fades people become less so
	  •   Media coverage warps our views of severe events
	  •   **"Emotional tail wags the rational dog"**
	  •   Importance of an idea depends on it's fluency and the emotional charge it elicits
	  •   **People very bad at dealing with small risks. Either ignore them altogether or overreact** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5282hpt2yytmm3xwwhfjj3))
		- **Note**: When something bad happens, people pay more attention and try to be careful. But over time, they get less careful because they forget what happened. The news also makes people think bad things happen more than they really do. People often decide things based on how they feel instead of using their common sense. People are not very good at dealing with small risks, so they either ignore them or get too scared.
	- Tom W's Specialty
	  
	  •   Base rate should be combined with individual circumstance. People tend to forget base case when hear individual situation or details ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52981kyw4pwpxs25b1g8d9))
		- **Note**: Tom W knows a lot about numbers. He says that when you are making a decision, you should not just look at the general facts but also think about the specific details. It's important to remember the overall facts, even if you are focusing on the individual situation.
	- Less is More
	  
	  •   Conjunction fallacy - When valuing objects in a group people tend to take the average so if a couple crappy baseball cards with great card it'll lower the average people would pay for the group ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52bk7w5r5br61z30m6j8sf))
		- **Note**: When people are trying to decide how much something is worth, they tend to look at the group as a whole. So if some items are not worth very much, it can lower the amount that people are willing to pay for the whole group. For example, if you have a group of baseball cards that includes a few that are not very valuable, it would lower the average price of the group.
	- Causes Trump Statistics
	  
	  •   **Teaching psychology mostly a waste if time as people ignore base rates when come across information that conflicts with their stereotypes**
	  •   People very tough to change their minds about human nature and even more so about themselves in negative terms ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52cvwnmt1j6mrqhwaepq0w))
		- **Note**: People often ignore facts when they hear something that does not fit with what they already believe. It can be hard to change how people think about themselves and about other people, even when facts show that their beliefs may not be totally accurate.
	- Regression to the Mean
	  
	  •   Reward works better than punishment
	  •   People's great performance will likely be worse next time as they revert to the mean
	  •   **Intuitive predictions are not regressive and therefore need to be corrected towards the mean**
	  •   **With small samples, regression to mean even more important** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52dzqxf1tjagecks9816na))
		- **Note**: Regression to the Mean is when people's performance isn't always perfect. If someone does something great one time, the next time they do it, their performance won't be as great. Our natural, intuitive predictions are usually wrong and need to be corrected. When we have small samples, it is even more important to correct our predictions. Rewarding people works better than punishing them.
	- the illusion of understanding
	  
	  •   **Humans fool ourselves by constructing flimsy account of past. Do not recognize role of luck in everything**
	  •   **Human mind does not deal well with non-events**
	  •   People find it very tough to recall what they thought of something or an event before their mind changed
	  •   **Tend to blame people too much when turn out bad and too little credit when good**
	  •   World being orderly is an illusion and we can definitely not predict future from past
	  •   Leader's effects very exaggerated. CEOs should not be praised as much as they are ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52f45aj2wgvkajpv8psb6h))
		- **Note**: Humans often make mistakes when they try to remember the past. We don't usually think about how much luck might have played a part. Our minds don't like to think about things that didn't happen. It's hard to remember how we felt about something before we changed our minds. We tend to blame people too much when something goes wrong and give them too little credit when something goes right. We can't predict the future from the past and it's often exaggerated how important people in positions of power are. We should not praise them too much.
	- Illusion of Validity
	  
	  •   Often overconfident in our skills. Stock picking for example on average is very much based on luck as opposed to skill
	  •   **Surrounding self with like minded people dangerous as it reinforces this overconfidence and way of thinking** (financial community refuses to believe could do better than just throwing darts at random stocks)
	  •   Overconfidence in explaining past makes us believe we can predict future but are very poor at this in reality
	  •   Experts often fared worse than chance when asked to predict something in their given field ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52g7wvt89h9nbz9fdavdtf))
		- **Note**: Sometimes, people think they are really good at certain things, but it is often just luck. It is not a good idea to be around people who think the same way as you, because it can make you too sure of yourself. People think they can predict the future, but they are usually wrong. Even experts, who are supposed to be really good at something, often have worse results than if you just guessed.
	- Intuitions vs Formulas
	  
	  •   Experts over complicate decision making and this often hurts the accuracy of their predictions. Simple formulas often fare better than experts. Wine price example
	  •   Use formulas for decisions when possible
	  •   **Intuition nothing more than great recognition**
	  •   Emotional learning may be quick but becoming an expert a very slow process. Being an expert can be thought of as a summation of thousands of small skills
	  •   **In order to gain a skill need a stable environment, practice and immediate feedback**
	  •   Be cautious of trusting people's judgment, even your own ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52gv1hc2ax6ve3d12v398k))
		- **Note**: Experts can sometimes make decisions too complicated, which can make it harder to get the right answer. It is often better to use formulas, which are like recipes for answering questions. Intuition is just a great way of recognizing patterns quickly. It takes a long time to become an expert, because it requires a lot of practice in a stable environment with immediate feedback. It is important to be careful about trusting people's opinions, even our own.
	- The Outside View
	  
	  •   Need to combine inside (case specific) with outside (general or average scenario) views
	  •   **Planning fallacy** - projects almost always go over budget and take longer than expected. Look at base case statistics and then alter to your specific project ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52htex3p60s09esvx3ceah))
		- **Note**: The Outside View means that we should look at a situation both from our own point of view (inside) and from what usually happens in similar situations (outside). The Planning Fallacy is when people think a project will take less time and money than it usually does. To avoid this we should look at the statistics of how projects usually go and then adjust that for our own project.
	- Engine of Capitalism
	  
	  •   Optimistic bias - people think goals more achievable than really are, better than they are and world more benign than really is
	  •   Optimistic people usually healthier and happier and often inherited from parents
	  •   Entrepreneurs more optimistic on average and drives growth although most fail
	  •   Outcome of small business depends on much on competitors ad market conditions than their own decisions
	  •   **Do not fall into the "all you see is all there is" fallacy. Ask the right questions and be wary of what you do not know**
	  •   Optimism might be necessary in order to get through small failures entrepreneurs and others will face on their career
	  •   **Premortem is an exercise before doing project which helps lower overconfidence and spark creative thinking** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52jetpzc1ph37w1v8hbv5x))
		- **Tags**: #[[premortems]]
		- **Note**: Optimistic people are often healthier and happier, and this optimism is often inherited from their parents. Entrepreneurs are usually more optimistic than other people, and this optimism helps them to try and achieve their goals, even though many of their plans often fail. The success of a small business doesn't only depend on the decisions of the people running it, but also on the competition and market conditions. People should be careful not to assume that what they can see is all there is, and should always ask the right questions and be aware of what they don't know. Being optimistic can help people to get through the small failures they face in their careers. Doing a premortem before starting a project can help to lower people's overconfidence and encourage them to think more creatively.
	- [Bernoulli's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli) Errors
	  
	  •   People are risk averse and people should decide between options by seeing the probability and outcome of the average of all the options in the group
	  •   **Reference dependence vital for almost anything it seems like. Is this color dark? - compared to what?...**
	  •   Bernoulli did not take reference dependence into account ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52n7e43k4xv2bc1w6tr9gg))
		- **Tags**: #[[risk aversion]]
		- **Note**: People are usually afraid to take risks, and when making decisions they should think about the average outcome of all the options.
	- Prospect Theory
	  
	  •   **Loss aversion drives most decisions but reference point also important**
	  •   Staying at status quo a version of loss aversion
	  •   Tastes change and bad effects look larger in your mind that good effects ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52q0g5sgjemfxz3z9tdbyn))
		- **Tags**: #[[risk aversion]] #[[decision making]]
		- **Note**: Prospect Theory is a way of making decisions. It says that when we make decisions, we are usually more afraid of losing something than we are of gaining something. This means that we often try to stay in the same place or position (called the "status quo") in order to avoid losses. Our tastes also change over time and it often feels like bad things have a bigger impact on us than good things.
	- Endowment Effect
	  
	  •   **[Endowment Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect) - value of something goes up after you actually own it**
	  •   Endowment effect not universal for everything you own. Depends on if own for use or exchange. Can be explained by loss aversion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52rc94372cnde574e6jw8y))
		- **Note**: When you own something, it can become more valuable to you than it was before you owned it. This is called the Endowment Effect. But this doesn't happen with everything you own. It depends on whether you own it to use it or to exchange it. This can be explained by the idea that people don't like to lose things.
	- Bad Events
	  
	  •   Brain prioritizes things that are bad news - angry faces for example
	  •   **Bad events weigh much more in out mind than good**
	  •   Lottery ticket is ultimate example of possibility effect. Care less when payoff huge ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52sc9fy3bf4j27accp2fmg))
		- **Note**: Bad things stand out to us more than good things. Even when we think we're getting a good deal, like a lottery ticket, we don't think about it as much as when something bad happens. Our brains pay more attention to the bad stuff.
	- Rare Events
	  
	  •   **Prospect theory - decision weight and probably not weighed the same**
	  •   Utility theory decision weights and probability weighed the same
	  •   If don't experience rare event don't give it as much weight in your decisions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52wa2kv3795tscksjq3d15))
		- **Tags**: #[[decision making]]
		- **Note**: Prospect theory and utility theory are two different ways to weigh decisions when making decisions. Prospect theory suggests that decision weights and probabilities are not necessarily weighed the same, while utility theory suggests that decision weights and probabilities are weighed the same. Rare events may not be given as much weight in decisions if they have not been experienced before.
	- Risk Policies
	  
	  •   Do not fall into trap of "all you see is all there is"
	  •   **Broad framing - do not consider one risk or gamble in isolation, think of all of them spread over your whole life and will see that this decision actually carries very little risk**
	  •   **Setting for yourself certain risk policies will help alleviate some of the narrow framing issues and make decisions easier**
	  •   People tend to be overly optimistic when planning something and then overly pessimistic to losses ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs52yvpzg43hj33f0czp0eb8))
		- **Tags**: #[[risk]]
	- Keeping Score
	  
	  •   **People keep mental accounts for their expenses or actions in order to keep score. One must be aware of these accounts and not weigh one much more heavily than others**
	  •   Realize when something is a sunk cost and do not make poor decisions because have already paid for something
	    •   Keeps people at bad jobs and poor marriages
	  •   **People have stronger regret to something that requires action. Even if same result but taken inaction instead you are less happy about it too**
	  •   **In order to avoid hindsight bias, make decisions after very thorough thought or almost none.** Regret when think a little and then can look back and scold yourself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs530195ca4aq7geh377mj0t))
- New highlights added [[Feb 13th, 2023]] at 10:29 PM
	- Frames and Reality
	  
	  •   **Framing of a question or situation greatly affects our beliefs and preferences**
	  •   Emotional area of brain active when decision matches frame, cognitive dissonance when choose something framed as lose (even if right decision), rational subjects combine the two and have little conflict
	  •   **Aim to make decisions which are reality bound and not frame bound**
	  •   Risk aversion or seeking also affected by frame and if a sure thing or a gamble ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5616nqr6gm5zdxkcfsngn1))
		- **Tags**: #[[framing]]
		- **Note**: Framing is an important part of decision-making. Our beliefs and preferences can be changed depending on how the question or situation is framed. When the decision matches the frame, we feel an emotional response. But if the decision is framed as a loss, even if it is the right decision, we feel confusion. To make sure we make decisions that are based on reality, not just the frame, we should try to make decisions that are not influenced by the frame. Whether we are more likely to take risks or avoid risks also depends on the frame and if it is a sure thing or a gamble.
	- Pain and pleasure drives mostly everything. Understand that duration of plays a big role when deciding ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs562q9yy3ybrfspcchrgaej))
