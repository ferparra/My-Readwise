	- Indirectional work means that you just feed your Zettelkasten. It is hungry and demands for notes a.k.a. Zettels. The more you feed it, the more complex it becomes, and the more it will actually talk to you. For additional information read: Create a Zettelkasten for your Notes to Improve Thinking and Writing
	- Directional Work means that you are working on a text, a book or an article, and feeding your Zettelkasten with notes directly and intentionally related to this book.
