	- The first question to ask with something like this is...
	  
	  Is it a component, or does it just need to be a style?
	  
	  Component – Can be extended, fixed, and managed more tightly (component props)
	  
	  Style – Smipler, and fixed in presentation. What font weights become a challenge

	- A sample of the common answers:
	  
	  Eyebrow – Too visual, lacks context
	  Label – Too generic, would name inner content as label though!
	  Stepper – I think this is more of a +/- component
	  Progress indicator – Nice!
	  Title – Pre-title, maybe?
	  Kicker – Love this, but hard for adoption

	- What can we do then?
	  
	  1️⃣ Over-engineer it to be a multi-level component that is wildly unnecessary 😂
	  2️⃣ Use styles, but lose "control"
	  
	  What would you choose?
