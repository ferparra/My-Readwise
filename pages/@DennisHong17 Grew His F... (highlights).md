	- @DennisHong17 grew his fund from $10M+ to $1.5B in about 6-years
	  
	  He has some incredible returns. I just absorbed lessons about his philosophies.
	  
	  Here are his 10 most important Investing principles that led to his success: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1408168100617404418))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ Find High-Quality Companies w. Ecosystem control:
	  
	  He focuses on businesses that control/dominate their ecosystem - Consumers, Producer/Suppliers, Employees, & Key partners revolve around the company. 
	  
	  All stakeholders love the company and hence it keeps competitors at bay. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1408168106049126406))
	- 1b/ Quality, Ecosystem control:
	  
	  Together with the earlier point, 
	  
	  He measures high-quality companies as those businesses that are either asset-light (high margins ideally) or even asset heavy, but have good predictability of their future cash-flow and growth trajectory.

	- 2/  Vertically Integrated Co's:
	  
	  He looks to identify businesses that control a major aspect of their supply chain and control at least a major aspect of the distribution of their product (or service)
	  
	  These businesses always possess a durable competitive advantage. eg $CVNA, $JD ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1408168122847223811))
	- 3/ Find Aggregator businesses:
	  
	  My definition - Investors should identify businesses that have a network model where the company is able to centralize information about a particular offering - and organizes providers around it and sell the services under their own brand. eg $UBER ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1408168130736705542))
	- 4/ Two-sided Marketplaces:
	  
	  Dennis loves Marketplace business models (I loved this one!). It builds on the aggregation b-models.
	  
	  These businesses possess durable competitive advantage due to their intrinsic network effect, brand, and ability to easily scale. e.g Craigslist. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1408168139502886918))
	- 5/ Cognitive Referent businesses (CAC< LTV):
	  
	  He believes that businesses that possess 'consumer immediate recall' have a sustainable low Ad cost
	  
	  This competitive advantage drives down CAC. This enhances sustainable LTV and strong consumer retention.
	  
	  e.g. $UBER, $ABNB, $DOCU ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1408168142707347468))
	- 6/ Identify businesses with High NPS:
	  
	  High NPS > Low CAC > High LTV
	  
	  Investors want to find companies that have high NPS (Personally, this is valuable in industries known for poor NPS). 
	  
	  Find companies that consistently delight customers and in turn, consumers love the company. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1408168150802309126))
	- 7/Other Principles:
	  
	  Amongst the qualities mentioned, He is also looking for businesses
	  
	  + Durable unit economics
	  + Network Effect flywheel
	  + Defensive Competitive advantage
	  + Founder Led w. exceptional managerial character
	  + That possess or exhibit a wide degree of Optionality ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1408168153084051459))
	- 8/ Some Fundamental  Investing Principles (a)
	  
	  He believes in the importance of always being invested.
	  
	  His studies have shown market timing is not worth the wasted cash.
	  
	  He holds minimum cash holdings and views cash as a call option on future volatility opportunities. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1408168161569083407))
	- 9/ I-Principles- b
	  
	  His most important goal- Always strive to maximize return on time & effort spent.  You can do it by developing mental models around industries.
	  
	  Also,  be able to reverse engineer your investment process so you can evaluate when you make investing mistakes (!) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1408168165159452675))
	- 10/ I-Principles-c
	  
	  One of the biggest lessons that had a big impact personally.
	  
	  He believes in the importance of portfolio concentration and always being invested in only your highest conviction names.
	  
	  Concentration forces you to set a very high quality bar for your portfolio. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1408168168493813767))
