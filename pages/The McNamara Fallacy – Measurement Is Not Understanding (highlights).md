	- What McNamara didn’t keep track of was the narrative of the war, the meaning that it had both within the military forces of each side, but also in the civilian populations of the nations involved. Instead, he applied the business aphrorism that you can’t manage what you can’t measure and treated his metrics as if they were in themselves the definition of success. McNamara insisted that if factors could not be quantified, they were not relevant to the management of the Vietnam War.
	- Genuine in-depth interviews that are analytically deep, rather than just taking a long time, are an important tool. So is ethnography that’s culturally immersive, more involved than the brief observational visits typically done by design thinkers.
