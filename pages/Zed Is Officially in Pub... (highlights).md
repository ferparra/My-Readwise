	- Zed is officially in public beta for macOS! We've been building Zed in Zed for a year now, and here's what we're loving most about it... 🧵 https://t.co/Kjwzjn1qhr ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/zeddotdev/status/1636034629848403968))

	- First: speed. From the beginning, we were determined to do whatever it took to make Zed fast. That's why we chose Rust, wrote our own GPU-accelerated UI framework, and created the Tree-sitter parsing framework. The result is 🚀. https://t.co/N4rz8Ut0k3 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/zeddotdev/status/1636034633665245184))
	- But Zed is more than just a faster editor — we've engineered it with collaboration as a first-class concern, because we believe we write better software when we communicate effectively about our code. 👩‍💻✨👨‍💻 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/zeddotdev/status/1636034636429279232))
	- Today, you can invite other Zed users into your projects to seamlessly write and discuss code together in real time. Soon, we'll introduce text-based conversations, so you can discuss any part of your codebase at any time, not just code you've recently committed.

	- The beta release we're sharing today is just a shadow of the tool we envision, and we're looking forward to chiseling away the marble in the coming months and years.
