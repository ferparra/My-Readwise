		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ Substitute for google search
	  
	  While ChatGPT is:
	  
	  • Lacking info beyond 2021
	  • Occasionally incorrect and bias
	  
	  Many users leverage its ability to:
	  
	  • Answer specific questions
	  • Simplify complicated topics
	  
	  All with an added bonus - No ads! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jspeiser/status/1609912460126863361))
	- 2/ Study partner
	  
	  Type “learn”
	  Then paste a link to your online textbook (or individual chapters).
	  
	  Ask Chatbot to provide questions based on your textbook.
	  
	  Boom. 
	  
	  Now you have a virtual study buddy.

	- 3/ Train YOUR OWN Chatbot
	  
	  I bet you didn’t know it’s possible to:
	  
	  1. Integrate ChatGPT into your website
	  2. Train it with customized information
	  
	  The result:
	  
	  A virtual customer service bot that can hold a conversation and answer questions (meaningfully). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jspeiser/status/1609912561184514049))

	- 4/ Counsellor
	  
	  When it comes to turbulent personal questions,
	  
	  Chatbot may spit out a disclaimer.
	  
	  But it will also give you straightforward and actionable advice.

	- 5/ Coding
	  
	  ChatGPT is opening the development of:
	  
	  • Apps
	  • Games
	  • Websites
	  
	  To virtually everyone. 
	  
	  It’s a lengthy and technical process,
	  
	  But all you need is a killer idea and the right prompts. 
	  
	  Bonus: It also de-bugs your existing code for you.

	- 6/ Outline your content marketing strategy
	  
	  As an example,
	  
	  I’ve asked Chatbot for an AI SaaS content strategy.
	  
	  It’s fairly basic, 
	  But you can ask Chat to extrapolate on each point until you’ve got a detailed roadmap.

	- 7/ Craft all your marketing materials
	  
	  Type “learn” and paste any existing copy (landing page, articles, etc).
	  
	  Then ask it to generate:
	  
	  • Ads
	  • Blog posts
	  • Email templates
	  • Landing page copy
	  • Social media posts / captions
	  
	  They’re not perfect, but make great templates.

	- 8/ Creative writing
	  
	  ChatGPT is revolutionizing creativity.
	  
	  It can write:
	  
	  • Poems
	  • Story plotlines
	  • Music and lyrics 
	  • Scripts for movies, youtube, Tiktok, etc.
	  
	  It can even write your wedding vows.
	  
	  Just don’t tell the mrs…
