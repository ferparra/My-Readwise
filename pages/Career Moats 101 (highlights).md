	- A career moat is an individual’s ability to maintain competitive advantages over your competition (say, in the job market) in order to protect your long term prospects, your employability, and your ability to generate sufficient financial returns to support the life you want to live. Just like a medieval castle, the moat serves to protect those inside the fortress and their riches from outsiders.
	- Pursue rigorous, informed trial and error. Trial and error dominates in situations where a body of knowledge does not exist, such as in business and in life. This is because it lets reality be the teacher.
	- Build the capacity for doing Deep Work in your life.
	- Screw motivation, build habits. I recommend Stanford professor BJ Fogg's Tiny Habits course.

	- When pursuing trial and error, remain in the game. Practice basic financial hygiene.
	- Practice dominates because success is determined by tacit knowledge, what the Ancient Greeks called technê. (This is a truism — if success can be determined via explicit knowledge, we can all become successful through reading alone). Self-help is better understood through the lens of technê, which then leads to certain surprising implications about reading self-help.
	- Beware writers who propose to teach you mental models without being practitioners themselves. (I call this the ‘Mental Model Fallacy’).
	- Understand how humans learn. Know that you can't teach what they aren't ready to learn.
	- When pursuing deliberate practice, recognise the difficulty of creating a DP-inspired training program. Recognise the differences between naive practice, purposeful practice, and deliberate practice. Pursue purposeful practice in domains where no established pedagogy exists.

	- When reading self help, judge the advice according to believability and usefulness. Keep in mind the hierarchy of practical evidence. Evaluate advice according to the domain the author inhabits.
	- Treat career moves as bets. When starting speculative projects, evaluate sub-tasks by information rate.
