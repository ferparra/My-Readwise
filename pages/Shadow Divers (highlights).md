	- Life’s splendor forever lies in wait about each one of us in all its fullness, but veiled from view, deep down, invisible, far off. It is there, though, not hostile, not reluctant, not deaf. If you summon it by the right word, by its right name, it will come. —Franz Kafka, Diaries ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1RSC&location=44))
