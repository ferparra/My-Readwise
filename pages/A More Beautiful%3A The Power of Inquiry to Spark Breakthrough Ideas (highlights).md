	- **"Why - What If - How"** model for forming and tackling big, beautiful questions. It's not a formula but more of a framework designed to help guide one through various stages of inquiry because ambitious, catalytic questioning tends to follow a logica progression, one that often starts with stepping back and seeing things differently and ends with taking action on a particular question
	  
	  1.  Why - helps you question the status quo and see potential new possibilities; backwards steps
	  2.  What If - helps you see things other than they currently are; leaps of imagination
	  3.  How - helps you take your question and make it actionable; action, failure, iteration
	    1.  Must narrow down to most promising question at this point
	    2.  Fail fast, get feedback, improve, repeat - establish a minimum viable product
	    3.  Important to study failures but equally important to study and understand what went right. Am I failing differently each time? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1pdhm72qnh27y3wv500ec))
		- **Note**: This document outlines a framework for forming and tackling big, beautiful questions known as the "Why - What If - How" model. This model encourages one to step back and see things differently, make leaps of imagination, and take action on a particular question. It is important to narrow down to the most promising question, establish a minimum viable product, and study both what went wrong and what went right.
	- **Innovative questioning** - confronting, formulating and framing the initial question that articulates the challenge at hand and trying to get some understanding of the context
	  
	  1.  Why does a present situation exist?
	  2.  Why does it present a problem or create a need or opportunity, and for whom?
	  3.  Why has no one addressed this need or solved this problem before?
	  4.  Why do you personally want to invest more thinking about, and formulating questions around this problem? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1qztynv4tewkqf2fxk1zd))

	- **5 learning skills or habits of mind**
	  
	  1.  Evidence - how do we know what's true or false? What evidence counts?
	  2.  Viewpoint - how might this look if we stepped into other shoes, or looked at it from a different direction?
	  3.  Connection - is there a pattern? Have we ween something like this before?
	  4.  Conjecture - what if it were different?
	  5.  Relevance - why does this matter?
	  6.  Approach questions, situations, answers with skepticism and empathy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1q2gzbp32pmxt1zxdq1zf))
