	- So much of building a business is about patience and pace. You want to build as fast as you can, but not before you interpret the data and gain empathy for the problem you wish to solve. You want to launch as soon as you can, but not before you have a product worth the cost of PR and marketing to spread. And you want all the users or customers you can find, but not before you’re able to keep them.

	- Contrary to logic, you don’t want all of your customers right away. You want your first cohort of “willing” customers to be quite small, so you can communicate directly and provide an incredibly high level of touch. At the start of your business, you must do a lot of things that don’t scale in order to triangulate your value proposition and build your brand. As you expand, you want to do so slowly.
	- In my experience, sustained (not-hacked) virality only happens when a product is polished enough to elicit trust and love from customers that are busy.
	- I also remember when Periscope was in its early beta with a very small but hyper-engaged audience that would jump in whenever a user was live streaming. These “willing” and often times visionary customers are the ones you want to engage first. You don’t want too many, because you want to get to know them. These early customers get what you’re doing and are willing to participate before you launch.
