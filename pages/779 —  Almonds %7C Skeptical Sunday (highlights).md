	- Almonds Are Good for You, but It's Not Worth It

	  So already struggling people have to struggle more so that these companies can make profits by growing water intensive crops in the middle of a friggin desert. Yep. Got it. I know also there's some aquifer stuff going on that gets even worse. Yeah. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So if they're using stuff like that, like fresh water from streams or anything like that, like a lot of almond farmers do, they're actually reducing local resources. And that can lead to shallow, warmer waters than expected in nature, which causes salmon to die from a disease called gill rot.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So almonds are healthy for you, but it's kind of not worth it if it wrecks the entire environment.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, sometimes, and yeah, that's the downside. Almonds are known or seen to be this amazing food for the human body. The Atlantic in an article titled the dark side of almond use in 2014 writes, this week, another large study added to the body of known cardiovascular benefits of eating almonds. Every ounce eaten daily was associated with a 3.5% decrease risk of heart disease 10 years later. Almonds are already known to help with weight loss, help prevent diabetes, help potentially mitigate arthritis, inhibit cancer cell growth and decrease Alzheimer's risk. And a strong case can be made that almonds are this is what they say, nutritionally, the best single food a person could eat. And that's a quote. But then they go on to say that 44% more land in California is being used to farm almonds than was 10 years ago. So the problem is only getting worse. Sure. And that thousands of endangered King salmon in Northern California's Klamath River are threatened by low water levels because the water is being diverted to almond farms. We have more and more salmon dying of gill rot. So people are weighing the health benefits against destroying the environment. Experts say that the real question is, what is the cost of growing nutritious food? And how can we minimize its environmental and societal costs? Because we need to provide food for growing populations, we need to protect our environment, of course. But we also need to bring economic prosperity to local farming communities. So as long as there is a demand for almonds and the market wants it, then growers are going to continue to grow almonds and they're going to grow them in the most efficient climates. And those climates just happen to be places where they're water stressed. So California, Australia, Spain, Iran, and Morocco, they're water stressed, but they're perfect climates for almonds. So do we shift to a more sustainable healthy product? Or do we shift to a more efficient way of specifically growing almonds?
