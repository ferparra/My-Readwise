- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Apr 14th, 2023]]
	- Expert Systems are 50+ yr old AIs that rely on lots of hard-coded if-else rules to automate knowledge reasoning. They are re-incarnated today as the "LLM + domain expert tools" paradigm. 
	  
	  Here's ChemCrow, making GPT-4 a chemistry expert with highly specialized software: ðŸ§µ

		- **Note**: Thread
	- GPT-4 is provided with a special "Chemist's App Store": a list of human-designed expert tools, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output. Then you can plug it into any Agent frameworks, like ReAct or AutoGPT, to automate the decision making.

	- The tool kit includes molecular synthesis planner, manufacture pricing information, functional groups finder, reaction prediction, and even a patent check (!!). In principle, GPT-4 can now analyze molecules and attempt to synthesize new ones, while avoiding patent litigation!

	- Of course, safety is of paramount importance here. The "App Store" also includes safety assessment tools that pulls from PubChem database to provide human safety guidelines, FDA approval status, and toxicological data.
	  
	  There're also potential misuse/abuse cases to consider.

	- Overall, a fantastic effort by the authors Andres M Bran, Sam Cox, Andrew D White, Philippe Schwaller.
