	- I wanted to stop people selling my data.
	  
	  So, I used the ChatGPT browsing plugin to search for where my data is being sold.
	  
	  Then, I used the DoNotPay plugin to request deletion under the California Consumer Privacy Act.
	  
	  Two plugins working together to fight data brokers! https://t.co/7T1XIOYvd1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jbrowder1/status/1644814314908565504))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- The @donotpay plugin turns ChatGPT into an autonomous consumer rights agent.
	  
	  We are working on tightening the integration so that these actions can be performed in a single request, and even in the background.
	  
	  Power to the people! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jbrowder1/status/1644814322647056384))
