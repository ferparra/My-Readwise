	- One of GPT's most under-appreciated features is one-shot structuring of unstructured data. The possibilities of this are far reaching and can unlock massive productivity boosts in many domains. This will be a thread of some experiments applying this to clinical note-taking ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petepetrash/status/1619578203143798791))

	- With not a lot of experience using the GPT API and some rudimentary prompt engineering, I can turn the following clinical note into this JSON, which follows a schema I specified:

	- Like most tools and even companies building on top of the GPT API, a clever prompt can provide a stunning amount of leverage. The prompt I prepended to the clinical note input does a few key things: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petepetrash/status/1619581898124328960))
	- 1. If your structured data includes any date fields, you'll need to tell GPT what the current date is. Otherwise it assumes it's 2020 by default. 
	  
	  This is as simple as `Today's date is ${new Date()}` at the start of the prompt. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petepetrash/status/1619582972340076544))
	- 2a. Context priming: This is incredibly weird and awesome. You're essentially telling GPT a story about itselfâ€”its origin and it's purpose in life. Cont. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petepetrash/status/1619584120639848448))
	- 2b. This is how I bootstrapped GPT to orient itself towards my input: 
	  
	  "You're a sophisticated NLP model trained on the mental health domain as well as clinical shorthand, abbreviations, and terminology." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petepetrash/status/1619584410323664896))
	- 3a. Get very specific about how you want the data to be structured. I know I want JSON, and my application data follows a particular schema. I also need to need to be mindful of the 4k token budget which counts against the prompt + output. Cont.. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petepetrash/status/1619585105667948546))
	- 3b. Providing a full JSON object with example values gets the job done, though it turns out if you're using a typed language (I'm using TypeScript), you can just provide the type interface! This approach enables some other capabilities, like narrowing using unions:

	- 3c. These types not comprehensive; just for testing. You may have noticed that I added comments to some fields. This is something I'm in the middle of experimenting with to further steer the output in the desired direction on a per-field basis. Seems to be working fairly well.

	- 4. Glue it all together. Here is the complete prompt I used to structure that example clinical note. All line breaks are removed, and there are additional instructions I'm experimenting with to further refine the output:

	- The preamble is currently 374 tokens. The continuation response is ~790. This would allow around 2,800 tokens in the clinical note (the mock note I used is 390) which is ~2,100 words. I'm certain the preamble and response can be brought down a lot, so there is plenty of headroom. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petepetrash/status/1619591255721410563))
	- Next up is the UI side of the equation which I'm excited to explore and share more about.

	- Here's a breakdown of the structured output based on the clinical note example. Aside from faithfully adhering to the provided schema, GPT was able to make some impressive inferences:
