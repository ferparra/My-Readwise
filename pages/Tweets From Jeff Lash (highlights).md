	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 179: Be judicious about asking for estimates. 
	  
	  It seems innocuous to have engineering size a feature/change, but these add up and ultimately take time/resources away from building. 
	  
	  It's OK to ask for estimates; just realize that each has a "cost."
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1409682713909489674))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 180: Learn more by NOT answering questions during user/customer interviews
	  
	  If they ask "Will your product do [X]?" or "What happens if I click here?" probe by answering with a question: "Is [X] important to you?" or "What do you think SHOULD happen?"
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1410054523289284608))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 173: Care more about being better than being first.
	  
	  Amazon wasn't the 1st online bookseller/retailer; the iPod wasn't the 1st portable MP3 player; Google wasn't the 1st search engine.
	  
	  Speed to market matters less than providing differentiated value.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1407538163225071621))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 175: Think like a competitor.
	  
	  Product managers often can't spot flaws in their product b/c they're too in love with it.
	  
	  Pretend you're the biggest/most threatening competitor. What would your strategy be to win? What weaknesses would you exploit?
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1408261721790242816))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 174: Explain the value that product management provides.
	  
	  Don't assume others in your organization understand what #prodmgmt does and why it's needed.
	  
	  Create a value proposition for product management and explain how it adds value for customers and the org. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1407890836529070115))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 176: Use the phrase "Help me understandâ€¦"
	  
	  It's one of the most powerful things to ask in a customer interview (i.e. "... what you meant when you said XYZ") and works great with colleagues (i.e. "... what help you need from me to hit that deadline").
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1408615578634498050))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 177: Repeat yourself.
	  
	  Communicating something 1x won't make it stick
	  
	  Use repetition when sharing a #product vision, strategy, priority for the next launch, etc
	  
	  Even if you're tired of it, keep repeating it until your audience is tired of hearing it

	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 170: Figure out how to build your resiliency.
	  
	  Having fortitude to get through (many!) challenges is key skill for #ProdMgmt.
	  
	  But "being resilient" is easier said than done, so learn what works for you (i.e. mentors, positive affirmations) to build resiliency. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4Sxh6pXMAUwHCB.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1406444310430617600))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 164: Focus on usefulness before usability (though aim for both).
	  
	  It's much better (and easier!) to start with a useful product and improve its usability than to start with an easy-to-use product and then figure out how to make it useful.
	  
	  #prodmgmt #ux #design 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E3z6C8NWEAMIrfd.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1404272478382329856))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 159: Be specific and outcome-oriented when asking for resources.
	  
	  Example:
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 156: To improve a team's performance, focus on trust.
	  
	  More fundamental and foundational than process, methodologies, roles, responsibilities, ceremonies, tools, or technologies -- trust in one another is the underpinning of all successful teams.
	  
	  #prodmgmt

	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 160: Focus competitive differentiation on ability to meet needs, not number of features.
	  
	  A product isn't "better" than a competitor based on HOW MANY green checkmarks it has; it's based on whether it has THE ONES THAT MATTER for target customers.
	  
	  #prodmgmt https://t.co/c3cYuvfx26 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1402818234450055168))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 161: Clarify definitions of metrics.
	  
	  Consistent metrics are great, but to ensure alignment & avoid misinterpretation, agree on common definitions.
	  
	  Example:. "Active users"; logged in during the past year or month? Calendar month or rolling 30-day? 
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1403174378557353985))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 141: Don't shy away from tough conversations.
	  
	  Providing direct feedback to a teammate, pushing back on a request from a big client or executive, calling out costly mistakes - these are hard to do, but often the "easy" way out isn't always the best.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1395953193738252289))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 142: Learn to make decisions with imperfect and incomplete information.
	  
	  While #prodmgmt needs to keep researching and testing to gather more data, product managers need to realize when risks of looking for more info outweigh risk of not making a decision. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2Cq4SpWYAUFh5m.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1396304203635625984))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 145: Think use, not just purchase.
	  
	  With users having more influence in buying and more products implementing subscription models, prospect-focused product capabilities may help w/an initial sale but retention will suffer if users aren't happy.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1397349227131506690))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 149: Prioritize problems before designing solutions.
	  
	  #Prodmgmt must ensure limited resources (time, people, money, brainpower) are focused on addressing the most pressing customer needs.
	  
	  Before creating a solution, ensure you're focused on the right problem. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2mi9qxXIAA7JaM.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1398828409325867008))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 151: Look for problems that, if solved, would benefit multiple personas.
	  
	  Facilitating sale of used equipment helps a seller earn money & the buyer save money.
	  
	  If a user can easily reset their password, it helps them & is less work for tech support.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1399569227594579971))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 153: Be persistent but patient when driving change.
	  
	  Transformation - like moving customers to a new platform, transitioning to "true" agile, or going from sales-driven to product-led - will take time.
	  
	  It requires lots of little steps along the way.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1400287617908985857))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 150: Make complex products seem simple.
	  
	  Users don't need to know or care HOW a product works. It's HARD to make complexity opaque, or you may want to try to impress customers with it, but it's better to hide unnecessary complexity from customers.
	  
	  #prodmgmt 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2pLsd_X0AcaUtZ.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1399015124166492168))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 136: Be a missionary, not a mercenary.
	  
	  Product managers who act as mercenaries may have some  short-term wins but won't have lasting success. #ProdMgmt as missionary means aligning product teams around a greater purpose to deliver bigger, longer-lasting impact. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1jpsatX0AUofug.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1394121633275817985))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 131: Build for a widespread need, not for an individual customer.
	  
	  Good product managers look for needs shared by lots of current/potential customers in a market segment.
	  
	  If you want to build for just ONE customer, that's fine; it's just not #prodmgmt. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1392310069795164163))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 132: Structure product experiments around hypotheses.
	  
	  Experiments shouldn't just be "let's put something out there and see how it goes." Good product experiments start with a hypothesis and the experiment itself is designed to prove or disprove it.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1392659878162927618))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 133: Don't treat product management as a democracy.
	  
	  You must balance views of different audiences/stakeholders. But not everyone gets a vote, and even so, votes aren't equal.
	  
	  #prodmgmt needs to take many things into account -- but then lead and make decisions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1393018584415232005))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 138: Follow the cone of uncertainty.
	  
	  With less certainty at a project's start vs. end, reflect this in roadmaps, timelines, "promises" to sales, etc.
	  
	  Flipping this- share early info that's likely to change, open Qs at the end- is hugely problematic.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1394684511456219140))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 104: Learn to balance diverging ideas.
	  
	  Successful product managers can hold two opposing ideas in their mind at one time and find the middle ground. 
	  
	  Instead of thinking "either/or," ask "why not both?"
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1382332364253184001))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 105: Market your product internally.
	  
	  It's not enough to have a great product; to get the mindshare and support of sales and key internal stakeholders, think about employees as a key audience. Work proactively and consistently on messaging to them.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1382821882475515906))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 114: Don't just share data; explain what it means.
	  
	  When sharing numbers and metrics with your team and stakeholders, don't inundate them with a torrent of data. Instead, tell a story that has a point/recommendation/request, using data to support it.
	  
	  #prodmgmt 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzyX-a2WEAMiezc.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1386150318786981891))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 115: Restate "obvious" conclusions and statements.
	  
	  What seems apparent to you (e.g. importance of a specific product capability) may not be as evident to others. Restate the obvious to reinforce important concepts and identify any misunderstanding.
	  
	  #prodmgmt 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ez3ho1NXIAsGsbW.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1386513247579394055))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 117: Define what you mean by a roadmap.
	  
	  Often what #prodmgmt thinks a roadmap is (vision of product's potential future) isn't what others think (commitment of exactly what will be delivered & when).
	  
	  What the definition is isn't as important as agreement on one ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1387102067395866625))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 118: Differentiate objections from barriers.
	  
	  Those in #prodmgmt face 2 types of obstacles; knowing the difference (and how to try and overcome each) is key:
	  
	  1) Objections: disagreements that create resistance
	  2) Barriers: impediments that prevent action ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1387607807365722113))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 119: Evaluate sunsetting options.
	  
	  Product sunsetting is more than a yes/no decision. Consider various options for products that no longer make sense to continue besides just "turning off."
	  
	  Divest? Spin off as its own company? License the IP/tech? 
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1387971054597988354))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 122: Involve users early.
	  
	  There are many reasons NOT to get user input early in the product lifecycle: hard to recruit, we know what they want, don't have time, etc.
	  
	  But those are all eclipsed by the main reason TO: it'll make your product better.
	  
	  #prodmgmt 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0bc-8SWEAEYvNx.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1389040690982752260))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 123: Set timeframes for experiments.
	  
	  Successful product experiments have a defined end. You won't keep your experiment open in the market forever; have a specific goal and decide what you'll do if you do/don't hit that goal in the defined timeframe.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1389407994409070592))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 125: Align around a "north star" metric.
	  
	  There are many metrics you can (and should!) use, but pick a main one to align around & use to measure  progress.
	  
	  E.g. win rate vs. main competitor; retention rate; % of users who opt in to redesigned version
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1390140715070631937))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 126: Dig into the data.
	  
	  Don't just collect and report numbers; figure out what it means. 
	  
	  A key product metric is changing - what's causing the change? Is that good or bad? What should we do differently because of it?
	  
	  Data + #prodmgmt = insight ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1390488575460978693))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 93: Spend time watching your customers/users.
	  
	  Research techniques like interviews and surveys are useful, but uncover unspoken needs and additional context, conduct observational research (follow-me-home, job shadowing, contextual inquiry, etc.) too.
	  
	  #prodmgmt 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EyDshVvXIAYVr38.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1378361725758636039))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 98: Spend time AS a customer/user, if possible.
	  
	  You ARE NOT your user, but time spent as one gives you empathy. Work a bit in retail if you manage a point-of-sale app, or check in patients if your product does healthcare appointment scheduling.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1380329292886913027))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 95: Involve technology/engineering early.
	  
	  Too many in #prodmgmt come up w/ ideas/solutions in a vacuum & toss requirements over the wall to dev.
	  
	  Success comes from partnering w/dev from the earliest stages of product ideation & throughout the entire lifecycle. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1379611150355206148))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 95: Involve UX/design early.
	  
	  Too many in #prodmgmt only think of #UX/#CX as UI designers who make already-defined features look pretty.
	  
	  Good experience designers can add tons of value in product discovery + definition and throughout the #product lifecycle. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1379070777492918278))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 99: Identify goals for the day & when/how you'll meet them.
	  
	  It's easy to get distracted, avoid responsibilities, or get pulled in to (not-really) urgent issues.
	  
	  Every morning, list the 3 things you *need* to get done that day and when you'll do them
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1380677349394542592))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 91: Sweat the details.
	  
	  It may seem boring & annoying to think through minutia of acceptance criteria, business rules, user flows, etc. 
	  
	  You may get fed up and want to move on but these details can have a big impact on the overall product experience.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1377751942282285060))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 94: Get your product right before over-marketing it.
	  
	  Or, in lean startup terms: Achieve product/market fit before attempting to scale.
	  
	  Don't let a rush to grow - or hubris - push you into marketing a product that isn't ready for prime time.
	  
	  #prodmgmt

	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 70: Minimize time to value.
	  
	  Maximizing customer lifetime value starts with getting customers to value sooner. Figure out how to shorten the time it takes to get them from "I want to buy/use this product" to "wow, this was worth it."
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1370224469374087169))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 79: Hope for the best and plan for the worst.
	  
	  Be a positive to peers, stakeholders, and to the market, but don't let that blind you to potential risks. 
	  
	  A risk mitigation plan is like insurance; something you need but hope you never have to use.
	  
	  #prodmgmt 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ew9xmi8XAAATe7-.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1373441393230802944))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 85: Generate new ideas by assuming your preferred solution won't work.
	  
	  #ProdMgmt too often jumps from problem to diving in to solution w/o considering other options. 
	  
	  To "force" yourself/your team to find other ideas, take your initial/top idea off the table. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1375447677689757704))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 86: Decide how you want your customers to feel when they use your product.
	  
	  It's not enough to define the features and capabilities your product needs to have; design for how you want your customers to feel when (and after) using it.
	  
	  #prodmgmt 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExiJ5ZsWUAMvlU9.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1376001485851492356))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 90: Compare future scenarios to reality, not ideal.
	  
	  e.g. When estimating the impact of a price increase on gross retention, compare it to expected actual retention w/o a price increase, not to an ideal-but-not realistic 100% gross retention.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1377446362531389442))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 78: Allocate your time according to your product priorities.
	  
	  If your product is mainly for lawyers and paralegals are a small user base, don't spend an inordinate amount of your time in meetings on a specific use case that only applies to paralegals.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1372937172492414976))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 74: Factor in additional investment needed when considering potential enhancements.
	  
	  Too many product managers only look at cost to develop a new capability & neglect to consider additional (tech) investment needed over time to maintain/improve it.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1371588308938145801))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 64: Create many solutions, don't just fixate on the 1st idea or the one you like the best.
	  
	  Forcing the creation of several options = more likely to have better ideas that lead to improved outcomes. (Supporting research: https://t.co/OaVHtK75X5)
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1368030123321090049))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 65: Seek out colleagues/peers with differing views.
	  
	  It may be "easier" to only work w/those who share your thinking but other perspectives help
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 66: Lead by example.
	  
	  Product managers often complain they have "all the responsibility, none of the authority." 
	  
	  Real [[leadership]] doesn't comes from an org chart but from  behavior. Act like a leader & model desired behavior to get others to follow.

	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 52: Establish product principles to guide product strategy and decision-making.
	  
	  Features, designs, and competitors come and go; principles do not. Clarify the key principles and guiding philosophies for your product and don't compromise on them.
	  
	  #prodmgmt

	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 43: Aspiring #product managers - don't talk about what YOU want to do, but instead on the value you can provide.
	  
	  Too many who want to move into #prodmgmt focus on their interests/needs/desires vs. how they can help solve employer/hiring manager problems. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1360226629369417729))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 41: Define standard names/descriptions for each launch type.
	  
	  Everyone may have a different opinion of what phrases like "soft launch" and "hard launch" mean. (Is there a sunny-side-up launch?) Create agreed-upon definitions and use consistent terms.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1359695373019791361))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 57: Make your boss look good.
	  
	  Successful product managers keep their boss's manager off their boss's back.
	  
	  This isn't about sucking up; it's basic product management: understand needs of your customer (read: boss) and figure out how to address them.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1365497442364518402))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 59: Turn down/"fire" customers who aren't a good fit for your business/product.
	  
	  Not all customers have the same needs so trying to be everything to everyone makes a product nothing to anyone. Focusing on the right customers means saying no to others.
	  
	  #prodmgmt 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvUPebsXMAEoJFz.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1366015147165253643))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 49: Gather market insight from other audiences, not just customers/users.
	  
	  Include influencers, analysts, thought leaders, etc. in your research efforts.
	  
	  Don't talk to ONLY these 3rd parties but they can be valuable to supplement first-hand research.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1362542054539223042))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 58: Rely on data over intuition.
	  
	  Product management is a job that requires making constant decisions in the face of uncertainty. While gut feel and experience can be helpful, look for data to guide and inform decisions whenever possible.

	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 27: Let your strategy guide your prices (vs. pricing dictating your strategy).
	  
	  For example: Want to grab market share? Price lower. Want to be seen as premium? Price higher. Targeting certain segments? Design + price packages specific for each.

	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 31: Take calculated risks.
	  
	  Don't try to eliminate risk entirely - that's not possible. 
	  
	  Don't take unnecessary risks - that's not smart.
	  
	  Focus on opportunities where the expected return outweighs the risk.

	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 34: Ask research participants to help refer you to others.
	  
	  At the end of an interview/survey, ask for suggestions to others who might want to participate. These "warm leads" make recruiting for research easier & expand your participant pool.

	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 39: Tailor your release cadence to the situation.
	  
	  Just b/c you CAN release weekly/daily/hourly doesn't mean you SHOULD. 
	  
	  Your customers/users/sales reps/partners/etc. may not be able to "consume" updates as frequently as you'd like to release them.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1358857019634184196))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 30: Think about what you want your product to be in the minds of your buyers/users.
	  
	  It doesn't matter if YOU think your product is "better" than competitors -even if it really is- unless prospects/customers actually believe that it's better.

	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 2: Clarify who your product ISN'T for. 
	  
	  Yes, you need buyer and user personas (you have those, right?) but specifying which audiences *aren't* targets will provide clarity for the #product team and help improve marketing and sales effectiveness.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1345435968615174145))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 8: Take time to reflect. 
	  
	  At the end of every day or week (like today), ask yourself: What value did I deliver - to customers, and to the organization? What did I learn? What should I start/stop/continue tomorrow or next week?
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1347535955352297472))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 4: Don't just focus on market opportunity; also focus on market feasibility. 
	  
	  Product managers love to say "If we capture just 1% of this giant market, we could be rich" but often don't have a good plan for "How are we going to capture that 1%?"
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1346106615041290244))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 10: Decide what's most important: scope, cost, launch date, or quality. 
	  
	  Have targets for each that you aim to hit; but if you can't, what do you relax 1st? 2nd?
	  
	  Make sure the #product team (& beyond) has the same understanding of the priorities.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1348270065007947776))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 17: Track your time. 
	  
	  Every day for a typical week (or 2), capture what you're spending your time on, then analyze it. What are you spending too much time on or not enough? 
	  
	  Then work to modify responsibilities and manage your calendar accordingly.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1350794107636088832))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 19: Think value, not price.
	  
	  If a prospect (or customer) says your product's price is too high, it means they don't think the value justifies the expense. 
	  
	  Instead of dropping the price, think about how you can increase the value - real or perceived.

	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 18: At the end of every research activity (e.g. interview, survey), ask participants if they'd like to participate in future activities.
	  
	  This lets you build a list of people to tap as-needed and segment invitees based on info you've already gathered.

	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 20: Create a product vision.
	  
	  It isn't a strategy, list of features, or near-term metric. It defines the desired future state: the audience, objectives & impact.
	  
	  Create it w/input from the product team and remind them/others of it on a regular basis.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1351881161346310147))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 22: Conduct a premortem.
	  
	  When starting a new product/initiative, imagine it failing. What would have caused that? Identify potential causes & figure out how to prevent them.
	  
	  (Good to pair this w/yesterday's tip: press release from the future.)
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1352654875306418183))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 21: Write a press release from the future. 
	  
	  When your product launches, what will it say? What does success look like? How will customers benefit? What will the (improved) experience be like?
	  
	  (More on how Amazon does this: https://t.co/0Dn52ClV0t)

	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 23: Think meaningfully. 
	  
	  Slow down and be more deliberate in your thinking. 
	  
	  It will help you learn more quickly, remember more information, and make better decisions.

	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 1: Realize that no one wants your product. 
	  
	  People want to address needs (solve problems or take advantage of opportunities).
	  
	  They'll only care about your product if it can help them solve their needs better than other options they're aware of.
	  
	  #prodmgmt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1345004671509934085))
	- #ProdMgmtDailyTip 195: Evaluate the value of solving a problem before trying to solve it.
	  
	  There may be a customer need, but is it widespread? Growing? Painful? What's the value to you of solving it?
	  
	  Too many in #prodmgmt jump to problem solving w/o asking if it's worth solving. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1415502817536712707))
