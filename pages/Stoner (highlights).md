- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- William Stoner is born at the end of the nineteenth century into a dirt-poor Missouri farming family. Sent to the state university to study agronomy, he instead falls in love with English literature and embraces a scholar’s life, so different from the hardscrabble existence he has known. And yet as the years pass, Stoner encounters a succession of disappointments: marriage into a “proper” family estranges him from his parents; his career is stymied; his wife and daughter turn coldly away from him; a transforming experience of new love ends under threat of scandal. Driven ever deeper within himself, Stoner rediscovers the stoic silence of his forebears and confronts an essential solitude.
	- Stoner matures, goes through life, struggles, tries to carve out some happiness for himself and his loved ones. He's a good man. He knows a depth of feeling. He gives his utmost to bridge the gap between his awkward self and people around him, to open up, to establish a connection.
	- Life rolls over Stoner in waves. In the end, he drowns in this ocean.
