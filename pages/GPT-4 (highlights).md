	- After watching the demos I'm convinced that the new context length will have the biggest impact. The ability to dump 32k tokens into a prompt (25,000 words) seems like it will drastically expand the reasoning capability and number of use cases. A doctor can put an entire patient's medical history in the prompt, a lawyer an entire case history, etc.
	  
	  As a professional...why not do this? There's a non-zero chance that it'll find something fairly basic that you missed and the cost is several cents. Even if it just phrases something obvious in a way that makes you think, it's well worth the effort for a multimillion dollar client.
	  
	  If they further increase the context window, this thing becomes a Second Opinion machine. For pretty much any high level job. If you can put in ALL of the information relevant to a problem and it can algorithmically do *reasoning*, it's essentially a consultant that works for pennies per hour. And some tasks that professionals do could be replaced altogether. Out of all the use cases for LLMs that I've seen so far, this seems to me to have the biggest potential impact on daily life.
	  
	  edit (addition): What % of people can hold 25,000 words worth of information in their heads, while effectively reasoning with and manipulating it? I'm guessing maybe 10% at most, probably fewer. And they're probably the best in their fields. Now a computer has that ability. And anyone that has $20 for the OpenAI api can access it. This could get wild.

	  What we really need is a model that you can run on your own hardware on site. I could never use this for business because they're reading everything you send through it, but let me run it on my own server and it would be unbelievably useful.
	  
	  Imagine being able to ask your workplace server if it has noticed any unusual traffic, or to write a report on sales with nice graphs. It would be so useful.

	  we won’t have that until we come up with a better way to fund these things. “””Open””” AI was *founded* on that idea, had the most likely chance of anyone in reaching it: even going into things with that intent they failed and switched to lock down the distribution of their models, somehow managed to be bought by MS despite the original non-profit-like structure. you just won’t see what you’re asking for for however long this field is dominated by the profit motive.

	  Curious why even companies at the very edge of innovation are unable to build moats?
	  
	  I know nothing about AI, but when DALLE was released, I was under the impression that the leap of tech here is so crazy that no one is going to beat OpenAI at it. We have a bunch now: Stable Diffusion, MidJourney, lots of parallel projects that are similar.
	  
	  Is it because OpenAI was sharing their secret sauce? Or is it that the sauce isn’t that special?

	  I think it's because everyone's swimming in the same bath. People move around between companies, things are whispered, papers are published, techniques are mentioned and details filled in, products are backwards-engineered. Progress is incremental.
