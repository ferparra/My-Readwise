document_note:: Bradley Buda, a software engineer and one of the founders of Census, shares his advice on how to re-enter flow when working on complex engineering problems. He suggests leaving the code in an "obviously broken but easy to fix" state before stepping away. This allows the task to be clearly visible and easy to complete when returning to the problem. He also cautions against exiting after hitting a "neat" stopping point or when hitting a wall or roadblock, as it can be difficult to re-enter flow.

	- Staying in flow is important, and itâ€™s why good engineering teams will swat away distractions (Slack, emails, meetings, etc) to maximize the length of these flow states. But what about getting in to these states in the first place? I (and I suspect many others) have struggled with overcoming the writers block that one feels when starting to engage with a big, hairy engineering problem - everything feels overwhelming, where do I even start?
