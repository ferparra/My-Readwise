	- I switched to vscode for running Jupyter Notebooks so that I can use @github Copilot and wow ðŸ¥°
	  
	  (that is coming from a vim/tmux/ jupyter notebook die-hard fan)
	  
	  Here is my experience: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/radekosmulski/status/1638882676596948997))

	- You can easily ssh from vscode into a remote machine and run jupyter notebooks inside vscode.
	  
	  This is how a notebook inside vscode looks like:

	- Refactoring actions in vscode are great! A slight advantage over the Jupyter Notebook web UI: https://t.co/SSjoyMWSqV
	  
	  On the other hand, not all the cell/kernel actions work as seamlessly in vscode as they do via the web UI.

	- Using Copilot often feels like magic!
	  
	  I didn't realize there was so much code that could be written just based on the context!
	  
	  Plus writing code like this feels much more fun!

	- In summary, I am not an early adopter, but very happy to have taken the plunge ðŸ™‚
	  
	  So far, being able to use Copilot is absolutely worth the minor inconvenience. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/radekosmulski/status/1638882702240915456))
