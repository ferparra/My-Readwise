	- But first... maybe you donâ€™t need a co-founder. Many have done it alone. I personally wouldnâ€™t without someone because I know how much it takes, but if that's the path you want to go down - cool. If it's for the tech, consider low-code, no-code and bootcamps first.

	- BTW, not being able to find one person to join you could send a negative signal. It doesnâ€™t to me because Iâ€™ve been in that position before. But some could see it as your inability to work on something someone else cares about. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sabakarimm/status/1358565779273310218))
	- Also, donâ€™t rush it. You are looking for someone like you or maybe unlike you - but either way someone who compliments you and that youâ€™ll work with for next 8-10 years. Key is to take your time and find the best fit(s). Notice the possible multiples. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sabakarimm/status/1358565780284080128))
	- Trust and joy. Whilst there are a lot of perspectives on this, I think choosing a co-founder boils down to these two words. Trust is about working with someone you can rely on and has the right intentions. Joy is joy - if you donâ€™t enjoy their company then youâ€™ve already lost.

	- To my suggestions:
	  
	  ðŸ’¥ ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
	  
	  Start with your circle, because you already have data.
	  
	  1. Your immediate group of friends.
	  2. Ask your immediate groups of friends if they can recommend someone.
	  3. Tap the people you used to work with.
	  4. Think back to those you studied with. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sabakarimm/status/1358565782272299009))
	- Then reach outside your network. 
	  
	  5. Attend networking events: @Hopin @eventbrite @Meetup.
	  6. Attend a hackathon: @StartupWeekend.
	  7. Try platforms: @CoFoundersLab @lunchclubai.
	  8. Get on social: @ClubhouseBest @Twitter @LinkedIn @instagram. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sabakarimm/status/1358565783182401541))
