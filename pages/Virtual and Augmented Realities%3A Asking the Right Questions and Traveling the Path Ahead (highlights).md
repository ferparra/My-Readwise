	- With immersive computing, instead of staring at screens or constantly checking our phones, we’ll hold our heads up to the real and virtual worlds around us. We’ll be able to move things directly using our hands, or simply look at them to take action. Immersive computing will remove more of the abstractions between us and our computers. You’ll have access to information in context, with computing woven seamlessly into your environment. It’s the inevitable next step in the arc of computing interfaces.
	- Many people ask me which technology will “win”. The problem is that question suggests two competing, mutually exclusive technologies. But it’s a false distinction.
	- Over the past several decades, every time people made computers work more like we do – every time we removed a layer of abstraction between us and them – computers became more broadly accessible, useful, and valuable to us. We, in turn, became more capable and productive.
