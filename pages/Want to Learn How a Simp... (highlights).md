	- Want to learn how a simple 2x2 can generate a strategy?
	  
	  Most product people shrink away from the word "strategy"
	  
	  2x2's feel too simple
	  
	  But the most high-performing executives are strategic
	  
	  Yet they also have simple strategies
	  
	  So let's discover how to do this (5m thread): ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540862917486198784))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- First, the 80/20 summary of what strategy is:
	  
	  "A strategy is a mix of policy and action designed to overcome a significant challenge. The art of strategy is in defining a crux that can be mastered and in seeing or designing a way through it." - RICHARD RUMELT ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540862962470109188))
	- 1/ THE CHALLENGE
	  
	  If "the challenge" is what you remembered, you're correct
	  
	  Identifying the challenge in the strategy is usually one of the things people avoid or get wrong ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863007273672705))
	- 2/
	  
	  It's uncomfortable and scary to deal & acknowledge problems
	  
	  Some cultures detest the negative connotations of the word "problem"
	  
	  But in the end, the strategy we then take is really “head in the sand".
	  
	  So step 0 is to remember to face the challenge squarely in the face ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863052102369280))
	- 3/ 
	  
	  It's going to get a bit mathematical.
	  
	  Remember algebra? Physics? Equations?
	  
	  You have to take the mindset of resolving what I call "the physics" of the challenge. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863096935284741))
	- 4/ 
	  
	  Sometimes you read a plan and you immediately see the 800-pound gorilla in the room
	  
	  Now you know: the gorilla is the challenge everyone avoids.
	  
	  But there’s more to this analogy. It is about power. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863141881561088))
	- 5/ 
	  
	  The challenge is like a gravity well: “the pull of gravity that a large body in space exerts." 
	  
	  The 800-pound gorilla pulls everything to itself.
	  
	  We'll get to this in detail later, but focus on the word "space" for now. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863187020546049))
	- 6/ 
	  
	  Linear algebra became one of my favorite subjects when I realised that an Excel table was a matrix
	  
	  After that, every other concept clicked for me
	  
	  I dealt with a lot of columns in my tables, and needed a way to reduce the complexity of the space ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863231996182531))
	- 7/ 
	  
	  I discovered Principle Component Analysis (PCA). It's awesome
	  
	  It takes the original data with many variables to a smaller set of factors (combinations of the original variables) that describe all the variability in the dataset. 
	  
	  At first you had 100 variables. Now, 5. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863276803842054))
	- 8/ EIGENVECTORS
	  
	  To simplify, the factors are described through eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
	  
	  Eigenvectors describe the "most discriminating vector in a multidimensional space".
	  
	  So what does that have to do with strategy? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863321657810946))
	- 9/
	  
	  You know how in the most basic 2x2 used by every product manager, one one axis you put Impact, and on the other you put Effort?
	  
	  Impact & Effort can be viewed as eigenvectors in the multi-dimensional space.
	  
	  The space is best described AT THE INTERSECTION of Impact & Effort. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863366515900423))
	- 10/
	  
	  You'll see mutated prioritisation formulas like RICE or BRICE or perhaps even FRIEDRICE (I hope not)
	  
	  The implication is that there are other factors in this space: maybe Reach, maybe Confidence, maybe whatever the B in BRICE stands for...
	  
	  Nice for nuance, but not critical ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863411336237057))
	- 11/
	  
	  You identify forces pulling in different directions, and, related to where they pull, you decide where to play.
	  
	  In the space described by Impact & Effort, the QUICK WINS strategy (high impact, low effort) gets as close to resolving the physics of the challenge. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863456152354817))
	- 12/
	  
	  It feels like leverage, where both vectors align to produce outsized effects
	  
	  You can spend little effort and get big impact? 
	  
	  Everyone wants that
	  
	  You’re reading this thread right because you hope that 5 mins on Twitter can help you solve a lot of hairy strategy problems ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863500960104449))
	- 13/
	  
	  Impact vs. Effort are fine and still work, but they are generic. 
	  
	  They don’t specify what kind of effort, for what kind of impact. 
	  
	  They just define the challenge, the 2 forces that move against each other. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863545868517376))
	- 14/ EIGENQUESTIONS
	  
	  In a great framework shared on @lennysan's newsletter, authors took the idea of eigenvectors and turned them into eigenquestions.
	  
	  "Great framing starts by searching for the Eigenquestion, the most discriminating question in a set."
	  
	  https://t.co/5YFK7TwbFD ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863590646915072))
	- @lennysan 15/ FRAMING
	  
	  By brainstorming and identifying the eigenquestions in your space, you're framing the core tradeoffs.
	  
	  Maybe it's your customers who want to have accuracy AND speed, and the physics of the challenge are such that it's either accuracy OR speed. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863635555340292))
	- @lennysan 16/
	  
	  You still have a lot to figure out from this framing
	  
	  But now the conversation doesn't go into other spaces or frames
	  
	  This alone can already produce focus across the team/org
	  
	  You're not solving other challenges, it's this one ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863680287473664))
	- @lennysan 17/
	  
	  The crux is there - you just have to find your way through it
	  
	  There will be more below the surface of the crux. 
	  
	  Why are these forces at tension? 
	  
	  How does high speed produce low accuracy? 
	  
	  But the process is the same every time, and it’s massively creative. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863725132980224))
	- @lennysan 18/ SWOT
	  
	  SWOT is what most think when they think of strategy
	  
	  It's common these days to dunk on SWOT.
	  
	  But don't blame SWOT yet
	  
	  I never see people use it right ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863770058260480))
	- @lennysan 19/ 
	  
	  The bit that everyone forgets with SWOT (besides being objective and specific about each quadrant's content)...
	  
	  You need to use the quadrants to design strategies ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863814924648453))
	- @lennysan 20/
	  
	  Brainstorm:
	  
	  What Strengths can help take advantage of Opportunities?
	  
	  What Strengths can minimize Threats?
	  
	  What Weaknesses to eliminate to avoid Threats?
	  
	  What Opportunities can improve Weaknesses?
	  
	  You have 16 variations of these to work through before you're finished. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863859677880323))
	- @lennysan 21/ 
	  
	  Back to the gravity well/800-pound gorilla analogy (confusing, I know)
	  
	  If you've ever seen a sci-fi movie, you know gravity wells are hard to escape, even if you put the pedal to the metal
	  
	  So it is with the challenge. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863904397524993))
	- @lennysan 22/
	  
	  It's not enough to identify the challenge and then set the tools down and expect the same resources will resolve it
	  
	  Just more focus and momentous clarity might not be enough
	  
	  You have to power it up using what you have or could reasonably get ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863949092147200))
	- @lennysan 23/
	  
	  "The honest facts are that some situations are irretrievable, that there is not always a clever way out.' - RICHARD RUMELT
	  
	  As I survey my options, often I see no great options
	  
	  Still, I harbor hope that I will find the leverage as I continue to play the game ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540863993979494402))
	- @lennysan 24/
	  
	  That's what most execs with poorly defined strategies hope for: that chance will produce power
	  
	  But hope is not a great strategy
	  
	  And even so, luck favors the bold
	  
	  Taking better positions is not prohibited
	  
	  And don't leave the gorilla in the room. It will attack eventually ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1540864038732763136))
