		- **Note**: Thread
	- To give these Notes the attention they deserve, there will be two separate Threads.
	  
	  Today, we‚Äôll talk about how and why Greenwald performs Value Investing.
	  
	  And his search strategy for investment opportunities.
	  
	  In the second part, we‚Äôll take a look at his valuation method. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1502367145447112712))
	- Being on the Right Side of the Trade
	  
	  When you buy or sell a stock, there‚Äôs someone else on the other side of the trade doing the exact opposite.
	  
	  One of you is going to be wrong. 
	  
	  You need to ask yourself: ‚ÄùWhy am I on the right side of this trade?‚Äù ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1502367146801827841))
	- Value Investing is the answer.
	  
	  Buying non-glamorous, unliked, and overlooked stocks puts you, statistically, on the right side of the trade.
	  
	  Why is that, and how can you find these stocks?
	  
	  Let‚Äôs start with the why and discuss Institutional and Individual Biases. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1502367148135665669))
	- Systematic Biases
	  
	  We talk a lot about individual biases and how to avoid them, but there are Institutional biases also.
	  
	  Let‚Äôs start with them and how they cause severe mispricings in the markets.

	- Institutional Biases - Herding
	  
	  Money managers' performance is measured relative to competition and indexes. 
	  
	  And while no one has a problem with outperformance, underperformance is a fatal problem.
	  
	  One that can cost jobs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1502367154842259463))
	- This situation creates Me-too managers. 
	  
	  Me-too managers won‚Äôt differ much from competition.
	  
	  They jump on the bandwagon as other people buy or sell and drive stocks up to ridiculously high or ridiculously low P/Es.
	  
	  This bias is what feeds manias. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1502367156088021003))
	- Institutional Biases - Window Dressing
	  
	  Window dressing describes buying the best-acting stocks near or before the end of the quarter.
	  
	  That way, you have successful companies in your portfolio for investors to show. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1502367157451120644))
	- Interestingly, it‚Äôs not a problem your performance doesn't match the performance of these stocks.
	  
	  It‚Äôs enough to have them in the portfolio at the end of the quarter.
	  
	  Clients will look at the portfolio and think: ‚ÄúThis is a good portfolio. No reason to be concerned.‚Äù ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1502367158763933700))
	- Institutional Biases - Blockbusters
	  
	  Institutions compete for investors' money. 
	  
	  To get that money, they need to convince investors they‚Äôre the best option.
	  
	  Something that always works are Blockbuster stocks. 
	  
	  Exciting new businesses with huge growth potential. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1502367160156532740))
	- The preference for such stocks is part of the reason why growth is so extensively overvalued.
	  
	  That‚Äôs why you want to be on the other side of such trades.
	  
	  Now, let‚Äôs look at the other side, Individual Biases. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1502367161389662210))
	- Individual Biases - Knowing 
	  
	  People often confuse what they know and what they think they know.
	  
	  And that mistake can get expensive.
	  
	  Knowable things are facts. 
	  
	  Your investment thesis is just that, a thesis. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1502367163826737152))

	- It‚Äôll be tested and might come true eventually.
	  But until then, treat it as what it is, uncertain.
	  
	  Otherwise, you won‚Äôt be able to change your thesis when the facts change.
	  
	  And that‚Äôs what a reasonable investor does.

	- Finally, let‚Äôs discuss Bruce Greenwald‚Äôs Search Strategy.
	  
	  By now, we know that we need to make sure we‚Äôre on the right side of the trade.
	  
	  Then the only logical question would be:
	  
	  Where can we find unreflective sellers on the other side of the trade? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1502367171627954178))
	- That‚Äôs mainly in what Greenwald calls ‚Äúobscure‚Äù situations.
	  
	  Small Caps, Spin-offs, or boring companies that get no coverage. 
	  
	  Most investors are in it for the excitement.
	  
	  So the best opportunities will be where those investors don‚Äôt wanna go. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1502367172982677510))
	- Oversold industries are another opportunity.
	  Why do industries get oversold?
	- Sooner or later, companies and industries, just like everything else, will return to their mean.
	  
	  That‚Äôs the number one reason Value Investing works. 
	  
	  But firmly believing in that is hard, most people only do until their beliefs get seriously tested. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1502367175583092746))
	- That‚Äôs it for today.
