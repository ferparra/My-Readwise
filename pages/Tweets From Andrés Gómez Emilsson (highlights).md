	- "There is no description of the universe that isn't arbitrary and conjectural for a simple reason: we don't know what the universe is." - Borges ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22There%20is%20no%20description%20of%20the%20universe%20that%20isn%27t%20arbitrary%20and%20conjectural%20for%20a%20simple%20reason%3A%20we%20don%27t%20know%20what%20the%20universe%20is.%22%20-%20Borges%20%28from%3A%40algekalipso%29))
	- Everyone knows that OpenAI developed [[GPT-4]] simply by taking [[GPT-3]] and adding the prompt:
	  
	  "The following is a text written by GPT-4 using this prompt:" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1589152134226153472))

	- Remember: in higher dimensions you rarely get stuck in local maxima - usually it's a saddle point masquerading as a cul-de-sac.
	  
	  This is why experiencing higher (phenomenal) dimensions on meditation/DMT can be so liberating. You notice you were never stuck. The knot isn't a knot.

	- Intuition for "energy parameter".
	  
	  Different "cuts" of the Hamiltonian of Consciousness (cf. Hyperbolic Geometry of DMT Experiences).

	- @EzraJNewman Everyone is a moral anti realist until:
	  
	  1. They experience the jhanas/think about valence on a good MDMA trip 
	  
	  2. Experience kidney stones or cluster headaches
	  
	  3. Notice that even thought and preferences are grounded in gradients of valence ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1608220378702438401))

	- To a first approximation:
	  
	  1. [[Consciousness]] is computational (algorithms) or intrinsic/physical (what physics is made of/building blocks)?
	  
	  The feeling of value/pleasure is:
	  
	  2. Not real, illusory, dependent on your frame of reference & values, or objective, measurable/universal? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1612933863696896000))

	- Recipe for alignment:
	  
	  Open [[Individualism]] + Valence Realism (+ good theories of consciousness)

	- You have to be able to prove the existence of the nine-point circle if you want to join the "math of DMT" research group.
	  
	  (I don't make the rules here - this is just following a tradition that dates back to the time of Plato for this kinda thing)

	- [[Resonance]] alone does not solve the binding (boundary) problem for the simple reason that [[resonance]] alone does not generate objective, frame-invariant, and caudally significant *boundaries*.
	  
	  But it *is* a piece of the puzzle, as it enables [[holistic behavior]]. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1620611576771534849))
