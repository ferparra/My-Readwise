	- You've def heard of "The Hero's Journey", the narrative structure dating back to Homer's Odyssey in ~7th century BC.
	  
	  A great way to learn the framework is comparing scene-by-scene images from 2 modern classics of the story type: "Star Wars" and "The Matrix". #TheMatrix

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 0/ The "Hero's Journey" was coined by Joseph Campbell, an American literary prof. 
	  
	  He studied ancient myths and found many shared a similar character arc (AKA the "monomyth").
	  
	  It follows 12 stages, with a hero venturing from an "ordinary world" to a "special world" and back.

	- 1/ Ordinary world 
	  
	  The hero's normal life before the adventure begins:
	  
	  ‚óªÔ∏è Luke Skywalker lives on a farm in Tatooine
	  ‚óªÔ∏è Neo is a corporate slave in The Matrix

	- 2/ Call to adventure 
	  
	  The hero is faced with an event, conflict, problem, or challenge that starts the adventure: 
	  
	  ‚óªÔ∏è R2D2 flashes a hologram of Princess Leia asking Obi-Wan for help
	  ‚óªÔ∏è Neo is sent a message to "follow the white rabbit"

	- 3/ Refusal of the call 
	  
	  The hero refuses the adventure because of hesitation, fears, insecurity or other:
	  
	  ‚óªÔ∏è Luke tells Obi-Wan he has to stay on Tatooine farm to help his aunt and uncle 
	  ‚óªÔ∏è When agents come to his office, Neo can escape by climbing out a window (but wimps out)

	- 4/ Meeting the mentor
	  
	  The hero encounters a mentor that can give them advice, wisdom, information, or items that preps them for journey:
	  
	  ‚óªÔ∏è Luke's aunt and uncle murdered by stormtroopers, he agrees to have Obi-wan train him
	  ‚óªÔ∏è Neo meets Morpheus, who soon trains him

	- 5/ Crossing the threshold
	  
	  The hero leaves the ordinary world for the first time and crosses the threshold into adventure:

	  ‚óªÔ∏è Neo takes red pill and leaves Matrix

	- 7/ The Approach

	  ‚óªÔ∏è Neo meets The Oracle, who says he's *not* The One

	- 8/ The Ordeal

	- 13/ Star Wars' creator George Lucas credits "The Hero's Journey" for improving his original script.
	  
	  Prior to applying the framework, Star Wars was "a Saturday morning space movie" according to composer John Williams.
	  
	  Lucas went on his hero's journey, too (naming hero "Luke").

	- 14/ If you enjoyed that, I write interesting threads like this 1-2x a week.
	  
	  Follow @TrungTPhan to see them in your feed. 
	  
	  Here's another one on storytelling that may tickle your fancy: https://t.co/MYJhTGKcjH ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1435985029771923462))
	- 15/ Since Star Wars, countless other films have used the framework (obviously The Matrix).
	  
	  The structure varies, so I use a Sheets template to map out other Hero's Journey (like for MJ and Lebron üòÇ).

	- 16/ Side note: Obviously dropped this thread because new trailer for The Matrix 4 just came out. 
	  
	  The trailer looks *very* close to The Hero‚Äôs Journey template of the original film.
