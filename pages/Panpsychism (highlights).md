	- In the [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind), **panpsychism** ([/pænˈsaɪkɪzəm/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)) is the view that the [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind) or a mindlike aspect is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism#cite_note-sep-panpsych-1) It is also described as a theory that "the mind is a fundamental feature of the world which exists throughout the universe."

	- Panpsychists posit that the type of mentality we know through our own experience is present, in some form, in a wide range of natural bodies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz1yhd7ndt1psxt4jm9m9p6))
	- [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato) argues for panpsychism in his *[Sophist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophist_(dialogue))*, in which he writes that all things participate in the [form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_form) of Being and that it must have a psychic aspect of mind and soul (*[psyche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psyche_(psychology))*). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz200hcbg5te0rpkt606w3z))
	- [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) developed a cosmology that held that the natural world is infused with the divine fiery essence *[pneuma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneuma_(Stoic))*, directed by the universal intelligence *[logos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos)*. The relationship between beings' individual *logos* and the universal *logos* was a central concern of the Roman Stoic [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius).

	- Who, then, is "animate" and who "inanimate"? Within the assembly of the Lotus, all are present without division. In the case of grass, trees and the soil...whether they merely lift their feet or energetically traverse the long path, they will all reach Nirvana.
	  
	  — [Zhanran 湛然](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhanran),[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism#cite_note-Parks-49) the sixth patriarch of Tendai Buddhism (1711-82)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism#cite_note-50) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz237k9h9vb8wjy9tdx6khr))
	- Hoffman views perception as a construction rather than a reconstruction. He argues that perceptual systems are analogous to information channels, and thus subject to [data compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression). The set of possible representations for any given data set is quite large. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz255pjqtt9heb8jz8t9c7b))
	- He represents rudimentary units of [[consciousness]] (which he calls "conscious agents") as [Markovian kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markovian_kernel) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz25j9avw95zbghvpyr0xs3))
	- frustration with philosophical theories of [[consciousness]] for lacking [predictive power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_power). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz27dd9rwv2t7b26enttgbm))
	- even basic objects or substances have a nonzero degree of Φ. This would mean that [[consciousness]] is ubiquitous, albeit to a minimal degree. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz28e6y7vzha9ywb5pxv0xh))
	- David Chalmers and Philip Goff have each described panpsychism as an alternative to both [materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism) and dualism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz28xtevf6jva6da8w2f04p))
	- But what [[consciousness]] is, we know not; and how it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djin when Aladdin rubbed his lamp in the story, or as any other ultimate fact of nature.

	- The questions of *why* and *how* this material structure has experience, and why it has *that* particular experience rather than another experience, are known as the *[hard problem of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness)*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz2by7f6nvgjxtj18m0220a))
	- [[Dualism]] makes the problem insoluble; [[materialism]] denies the existence of any phenomenon to study, and hence of any problem.
	  
	  — John R. Searle, [[Consciousness]] and Language, p. 47 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz2dwq3d9sg0qavczhmbe92))
	- [[Panpsychism]] has all the benefits of [[materialism]] because it could mean that [[consciousness]] is physical while also escaping the grasp of epiphenomenalism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz2es7v5f6ktd9rbvw400kt))
	- Physics is mathematical, not because we know so much about the physical world, but because we know so little: it is only its mathematical properties that we can discover. For the rest our knowledge is negative.
