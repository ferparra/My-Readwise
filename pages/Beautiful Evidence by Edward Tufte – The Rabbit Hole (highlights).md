	- Science and art have in common intense seeing, the wide-eyed observing that generates empirical information.
	- The principles of analytical thinking (and thus analytical design) are universal – like mathematics, the laws of Nature, the deep structure of language – and are not tied to any language, culture, style, century, gender, or technology of information display.
	- Multiple sources and levels of data – use whatever evidence it takes to understand what is going on. Too often diagrams instead rely solely on one type of data or stay at one level of analysis
	- Principle 1: Comparisons – show comparisons, contrasts, differences
	- Principle 2: Causality, mechanisms, structure, explanation – show causality, mechanism, explanation, systemic structure
	- Principle 3: Multivariate Analysis – show multivariate data; show more than 1 or 2 variables
	- Principle 4: Integration of Evidence – completely integrate words, numbers, diagrams
	- Principle 5: Documentation – thoroughly describe the evidence. Provide a detailed title, indicate the authors and sponsors, document the data sources, show complete measurement scales, point out relevant issues.
	- Principle 6: Content counts most of all – analytical representations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their contentMaking a presentation is a moral act as well as an intellectual activity
	- A clear sign of cherry-picking is that a report appears too good to be true, provoking consumers of the report to mutter, “It’s more complicated than that.” Avoid overreaching, slippery language, stupendous conclusions
