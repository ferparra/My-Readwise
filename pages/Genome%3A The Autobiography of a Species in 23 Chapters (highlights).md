document_note:: Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters by Matt Ridley explores how genes work and affect us, as well as their role in life. It dives into topics such as Shannon's Information Theory, the double helix DNA structure, heritability, the impact of genes on behavior, the ability to metabolize alcohol, instinct and learning, and genetic determinism. Through this, Ridley reveals the history of our species and the importance of being multidisciplinary in understanding life.

	- **Shannon’s Information Theory is more helpful for understanding life than mountains of knowledge from biology and chemistry**
	  
	  1.  *The importance of being multidisciplinary* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq8b2qpe9x0cev5q60bjy5z))
	- Intelligence has a large component which is inherited but it is important to remember that heritability does not mean immutability. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq8b5xdnwa1y41nspbdkf08))
	- •   **Lower levels of serotonin are associated with alphas, but this is an effect, not a cause. The alpha's view of themselves and their position in the pack raises or lowers their serotonin levels. Leaders are in fact calmer, less aggressive than lower-status people in the same group. They tend to be better at reconciliation and remaining calm under pressure**
	  •   **Although genes have a tremendous impact on us, behavior is a great determinant as well. Behavior impacts genes as much as genes impact behavior. The psychological drives the physical. Hormones and chemical makeup changes based on how much control you have in your life, your status and stress, and much more** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq8bgs6kzz79zk07xmr3tth))
	- Instinct is genetically determined behavior whereas learning is behavior modified by experience. Learning slowly gives way to instinct ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq8bp700nw2wsvvxckr429v))
