	- 1/ As you start in @logseq you'll soon experience the need to add structure to better navigate and retrieve your info.
	  
	  Everyone has different needs, and there are a few ways to achieve similar results, as in the pic below.
	  
	  Finding a way that works for you is part of the journey

	- @logseq 2/ Should you organise information top-down or bottom-up?
	  
	  Bottom-up is when you're building links to existing information (usually, though not always) at the location where it is entered.
	  
	  Top-down means building links to information from a higher-level point of departure. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1545404690455617536))
	- @logseq 3/ It's not really a debate, rather 'both-and'.
	  
	  Outliners allow you to branch your notes top-down, whilst easily zooming into & editing at the bottom levels
	  
	  Bi-directional links mean you're getting a link at both the top and bottom level - you just need to know where to look üôÇ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1545404693068713984))
	- @logseq 4/ Most TfT users are now convinced of the power of linking, but using outlines is an under-rated super power IMO.
	  
	  It's possible to house a lot of information on one page, rather than creating 'atomic' pages. 
	  
	  Having your half-formed ideas in one place makes it easy to dive in. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1545404695694307328))
	- @logseq 5/ What about MOCs? 
	  
	  I think many users are confused by the concept. At their simplest, they function as top-down tables of contents or indexes.
	  
	  But you can also use them as collecting points for your developing ideas (as described in 4 ‚òùüèΩ)

	- @logseq 6/ Your organisation will usually be chaotic to start: a mess of [[links]] & #tags.
	  
	  This is good to ensure that you're easily able to resurface the information that you're looking for.
	  
	  However, as your database grows, your friction points will reveal where structure is required ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1545404701327298563))
	- @logseq 7/ What am I doing? I default to outlining & bottom-up linking.
	  
	  I've moved lots of atomic notes back from their own pages into outlines on MOC-type pages.
	  
	  I also use a lot of properties. This allows me to use queries to generate tables if I want to.

	- @logseq 8/ The more interesting question for me is how to tag things for effective retrieval.
	  
	  e.g. You can either use 1. [[meeting effectiveness]] 2. [[meetings/effectiveness]] or 3. [[effectiveness]] [[meetings]] .
	  
	  Option 1 and 2 are my go-to's, and I'm leaning more to 2 recently. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1545404706716938241))
	- @logseq 9/ I only started using Option 2 after watching @joshduffney's video. I was sceptical at first, but I've found it to be a good way to systematise my linking.
	  
	  It's easy to input, works nicely in search & the dynamic tag index from namespaces is great!

	- @logseq @joshduffney 10/ There will always be trade-offs in approaches though. As I said, finding a way that works for you is part of the process.
