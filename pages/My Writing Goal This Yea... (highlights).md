	- My writing goal this year is to write a tweet thread a week on whatever's on my mind.
	  
	  Everything I write takes the form of confident, logical Julie giving advice to anxious, emotion-laden Julie. 
	  
	  26 threads so far; here's my favorite 7 from the past half year ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joulee/status/1412873541532356609))

	- Oh, and why Twitter threads? (I get asked this a lot.) 
	  
	  1) Great distribution for short-form text
	  2) Lower friction to put out an idea
	  3) 280 char constraint pushes me to focus on succinctness and clarity
	  
	  The third one is a biggie because I'm wordy :) 
	  
	  Okay, fav threads below: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joulee/status/1412873542241198081))
	- Why Data and Design, like Captain America and Iron Man, aren't at odds with each other and work better as a team. 
	  
	  (Also how I think of working with my dear co-founder Chandra :)

	- 40% of my job as a founder is recruiting. I happen to love meeting people and getting to know them, so I am constantly thinking about what I can do or say to deepen our understanding of one another. 
	  
	  These are my fav questions:

	- Since I think about recruiting a lot, I also frequently imagine myself in the shoes of someone considering joining some company or org. It's a big and complicated decision, and my hack is to simplify by thinking of companies similarly to individuals.

	- Sometimes I'll have a chat with a friend and they'll ask me a question like "What should I know about X?" And then I think about all the incorrect assumptions I made about X when I was in their shoes, and thus, lists like the one below are born.

	- Even though I wrote a book about management, I have a million things yet to learn about managing. 
	  
	  This thread is about a recent lightbulb-moment insight that really wish I had pieced together earlier.

	- I don't play as many video games nowadays but I'll always self-identify as a gamer. So of course I love the question: "What game are you playing?" This was a particularly fun one to write.

	- As much as I write advice, for myself and others, the meta-advice is always this: everything is contextual. 
	  
	  Do we understand the context well enough to know how to tilt in this particular instance?

	- I summarize weekly threads into monthly e-mail batches, so you can catch the previous (and future) ones here.
