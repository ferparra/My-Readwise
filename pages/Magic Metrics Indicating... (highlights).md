	- Magic metrics indicating a startup probably has product/market fit:
	  
	  1) cohort retention curves that flatten (stickiness)
	  2) actives/reg > 25% (validates TAM)
	  3) power user curve showing a smile -- with a big concentration of engaged users (you grow out from this strong core) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1184170125525577728))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 3) viral factor >0.5 (enough to amplify other channels)
	  4) dau/mau > 50% (it's part of a daily habit)
	  5) market-by-market (or logo-by-logo, if SaaS) comparison where denser/older networks have higher engagement over time (network effects) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1184170126574116865))
	- 6) D1/D7/D30 that exceeds 60/30/15 (daily frequency)
	  7) revenue or activity expansion on a *per user* basis over time -- indicates deeper engagement / habit formation
	  8) >60% organic acquisition -- CAC doesn't even matter!
	  
	  Having even one is impressive -- it'd make me sit up! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1184170127345893376))
