	- New products fail for many reasons. But the root of all innovation evil—what billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk would call the set of “first principles”—is the failure to put the customer’s willingness to pay for a new product at the very core of product design.
	- “What value does this component bring to our customer and its customers, and what portion of that value can we capture?” Instead, it asked, “What does this component cost to make, and what minimum margin do I need to add on top of that?”
	- Whether you like it or not, your customers are different, so customer segmentation is crucial. But segmentation based on demographics—the primary way companies group their customers—is misleading. You should build segments based on differences in your customers’ willingness to pay for your new product.
	- Doing product configuration right means you design a product with the right features for a segment—that is, just the features customers are willing to pay for.
	- Ideally, no more than a quarter of your customers should opt for the good option, while 70 percent should opt for the better or the best

	- So which goals are most important for your new products? Revenue? Market share? Total profit? Profit margin? Customer lifetime value? Average revenue per unit? Something else? Whichever goals you choose, you cannot maximize all of them at the same time. In setting goals, you must make trade-offs.
	- How can you maximize your acquisition success? You need to start by articulating benefits—not features—and focus on the most important ones. You need to speak the customer’s language, not your language. Finally, you need to get your marketing and sales teams involved early in the product development process.

	- Value is a measure of the benefit to the customer. Communicate benefits, not features. Take each feature and ask yourself this: What does the customer achieve because of this feature? If you are still unsure about how to phrase your product’s benefits, probe your customers about their pain points and how your product would solve them.
	- Matrix of Competitive Advantages (MOCA) To create this matrix, you list the relative importance of your innovation’s benefits to customers on the y-axis. On the x-axis, you rate your innovation’s performance against the competition
	- Myth: Until the business knows precisely what it’s building, it cannot possibly assess what it is worth.
	- In the words of Josh Gold, “Our beta users have skin in the game by actually paying for the pilot tests.”
