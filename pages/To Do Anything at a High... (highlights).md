	- To do anything at a high level, be that playing basketball or doing data science, it's all the same:
	  
	  ✅ immerse yourself in the field by watching vids, listening to podcasts (tacit knowledge is key!)
	  ✅ strong fundamentals > fancy play
	  ✅ practice a lot

	- ✅ data (results) > opinions
	  ✅ change your approach if you are not seeing results
	  ✅ find a role model to emulate
	  ✅ read a lot
