		- **Note**: Thread
	- Meet Vitalik Buterin. 
	  
	  In 2013, the then 19-year-old Russian-Canadian programmer published the Ethereum whitepaper. 
	  
	  He imagined a new programming platform that would draw inspiration from Bitcoin's blockchain tech, but would allow for far more use cases than its predecessor.

	- "The world's programmable blockchain." 
	  
	  What does that actually mean? 
	  
	  Bitcoin is a digital gold. It's a store of value & a medium of exchange. 
	  
	  Ethereum is the infrastructure of a digital city. It was imagined as a foundation for businesses and applications to be built atop. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1425476421875609616))
	- This digital city I speak of isn't hypothetical. 
	  
	  It's being built & growing as we speak. 
	  
	  More than 3,700 applications have been built on the Ethereum blockchain. 
	  
	  And more than 200,000 developers are building in Ethereum's native language, Solidity.

	- We'll talk more about these applications in a minute. 
	  
	  But first, to truly understand Ethereum, you must study its defining features: 
	  
	  • Smart Contracts
	  • Solidity
	  • dApps
	  • Ether ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1425476431975378951))
	- Smart Contract 📜🤝
	  
	  What is it? 
	  
	  The most important feature of Ethereum that transforms it from a singular currency to a programmable blockchain.
	  
	  A smart contract is a non-alterable agreement between parties memorialized with code. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1425476432864718852))
	- Smart Contract 📜🤝
	  
	  How does it work? 
	  
	  If this --> then that
	  Input --> output
	  
	  Think of it like a vending machine. 
	  
	  Put money in & click a button, it will then output a snack or drink. 
	  
	  That logic is programmed into the vending machine. 
	  
	  Smart contracts are no different. https://t.co/DzHZh1jeM4 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1425476447846780942))
	- Smart Contract 📜🤝 
	  
	  Examples? 
	  
	  1. When it's your sister's birthday on the same date each year, a smart contract releases $100. 
	  
	  2. Upon input of a death certificate, a smart contract releases $$ as defined by the life insurance policy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1425476449184649221))
	- Next, Solidity ​👨‍💻​👩‍💻​
	  
	  What is it? 
	  
	  Solidity is an object-oriented programming language primarily used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. 
	  
	  Solidity was initially proposed in August 2014 by Gavin Wood, one of Ethereum's co-founders. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1425476450124193797))
	- This leads us to dApps 📱
	  
	  What is it? 
	  
	  Stands for decentralized application, a dApp is the combination of smart contracts & a user interface so that consumers can interact with it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1425476451063799813))
	- dApps 📱
	  
	  How do they work? 
	  
	  Much like an app on your iPhone. 
	  
	  The user experience is very similar. dApps take the form of games, banking, trading. 
	  
	  But, the back end is very different. dApps are decentralized and built with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1425476451885854725))
	- This digital city is almost formed. 
	  
	  Ethereum is the foundation. The ground on which buildings can be built. 
	  
	  Smart contracts are steel beams that hold the building together. 
	  
	  dApps are built buildings that all can see. 
	  
	  Solidity is the glue that holds each building together.

	- What's missing? A currency.
	  
	  The lifeblood of a vibrant economy. 
	  
	  Ether 💰
	  
	  What is it? 
	  
	  A currency that powers the Ethereum blockchain. 
	  
	  It is how goods are bought/sold. It is how transaction validators are compensated for their work keeping order in this city.

	- We have our city. 
	  
	  The foundation, the buildings, the currency that powers it. 
	  
	  But what sorts of businesses are most prominent within Ethereum? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1425476466209398789))
	- DeFi 🏦
	  
	  What is it? 
	  
	  A new alternative to the current financial system. 
	  
	  The world of Finance is defined by middlemen. 
	  
	  Banks. Exchanges. Insurance companies.
	  
	  DeFi is all about taking out the middleman, increasing transparency, and giving users back their data.

	- DeFi 🏦
	  
	  Example? 
	  
	  Generating interest on your cash. 
	  
	  Right now, money sitting in your checking account earns .01%. 
	  
	  Because they that don’t have the costs of a traditional bank, DeFi lending platforms can offer up to 3% interest on your money. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1425476472467251201))
	- NFT 🖼️
	  
	  What is it? 
	  
	  Stands for non-fungible token, an NFT is a way to make digital assets scarce and unique. 
	  
	  Because of smart contracts & the Ethereum blockchain, NFTs can only have one official owner at a time and no one can modify the record of who owns it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1425476473297768455))
	- NFT 🖼️
	  
	  Example? 
	  
	  NFTs are taking the digital art & collectible world by storm. 
	  
	  For the first time, digital artists can create scarcity around their work & collectors can buy NFTs as investments. 
	  
	  @beeple, the most famous NFT artist, sold "Everydays" for $69 million in March.

	- DAO 👥
	  
	  What is it? 
	  
	  Decentralized autonomous organization. 
	  
	  A business that is owned and managed by its members versus a CEO or an individual.
	  
	  DAOs run on smart contracts, where code defines how the business operates and is 100% transparent for anyone to see. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E8hPTrBWEAkEAAF.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1425476484010029059))
	- DAO 👥
	  
	  Example? 
	  
	  A charity that’s runs by members. 
	  
	  All donations are accepted by the DAO and the smart contract decides how the charity will spend those donations. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1425476485033439237))
