	- Pick's theorem, a mathematical gem, a profound mathematical theorem, but with an elementary proof. I find it excellent for teaching how to write proofs, because one naturally approaches the general theorem in a series of easier cases. #ProofandtheArt

	- Pick's theorem is the focus of chapter 8 in my book Proof and the Art of Mathematics, recommended for those teaching an introduction-to-proofs course. Filled with interesting mathematical theorems with elementary proofs, proof advice, mathematical habits. https://t.co/a2wJ0cj7t9 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JDHamkins/status/1556764059931779073))
	- I find Pick's theorem a good instance for proof-writing, because the students must establish a powerful general theorem from a series of easier cases, which nevertheless involve genuine mathematical ideas, such as triangulation, far more subtle than it might initially appear.
