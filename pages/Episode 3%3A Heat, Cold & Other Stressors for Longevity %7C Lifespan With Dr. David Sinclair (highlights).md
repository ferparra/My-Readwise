document_note:: In this episode of Lifespan, Dr. David Sinclair and Matthew LaPlante discuss non-dietary interventions that can impact longevity, such as physical activity, cold and heat therapy, and adversity mimetics. They emphasize the importance of low- and high-intensity exercise, resistance training, cycling heat and cold exposure, and using measures like the Horvath clock to track biological age. They also discuss hyperbaric oxygen treatment and its benefits, as well as the importance of activating brown fat, heat shock proteins, and pathways that build blood vessels and mitochondria through cold and heat therapy.
