	- Using Recurrenal Nets to Fix Transcripts
	  
	  Summary:
	  We think we're still kind of in the early stages of figuring out all the parts of the fly will to use, you know. Thay'd be interesting like a omos ike recurrenal net for fixing, for fixing transcripts. our business model is being paid to anitate pataa. Dt, tataa. Y, and so we've got o, like ridden this fly wheel. Toto thi, oint m,. O thdar, the datais there. E, i wonder, i wonder if there's information in the fixing that'stha, that provides deeper set of signal than just like the raw data. Can use that as ted

	  Our business model is being paid to annotate the data. So it's kind of like a pretty magical flywheel. And so we've kind of like written this flywheel to this point. And we think we're still kind of in the early stages of figuring out all the parts of the flywheel to use, you know, because we have the final transcripts. And we have the the audios. And we train on that. But we in principle also have all the edits that the rivers make, right? Oh, that's interesting.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  How can you use that as a data?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  That's that's something for us to figure out in the future.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  But you know, we feel like we're only in the early stages, right? So the data is there that'd be interesting, like almost like a recur and yall net for fixing for fixing transcripts. I always remember we did segmentation annotation for driving data. So segmenting the scene like visual data. And you could you can get all those drawing people drawing polygons around different objects and so on. And it feels like it always felt like there was a lot of information in the clicking the sequence of clicking that people do the kind of fixing of the polygons that they do. Now there's a few papers written about how to draw polygons, like with recurrent, you know, nets to try to learn from the human clicking. But it was just like experimental, you know, it was one of those like CBPR type papers that people do like a really tiny data set. It didn't feel like people really tried to do it seriously. And I wonder, I wonder if there's information in the fixing that's hot that that provides deeper set of signal than just like the raw data.
