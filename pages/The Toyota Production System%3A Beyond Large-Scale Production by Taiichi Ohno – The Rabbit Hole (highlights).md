	- Manufacturing must be both efficient and also have respect for the person running the machine.
	- All we are doing is looking at the timeline, from the moment the customer gives us an order to the point when we collect the cash. And we are reducing that time line by removing the non-value-added wastes. Simple, but brilliant
	- The basis of the TPS is the absolute elimination of waste. The two pillars to support the system are Just in Time and Autonomation, or automation with a human touch. The tool used to operate the system is kanban
	- JIT means that, in a flow process, the right parts needed in assembly reach the assembly line at the time they are needed and only in the amount needed.
	- The autonomic nervous system responds even when we are asleep. The human body functions in good health when it is properly cared for, fed and watered correctly, exercised frequently, and treated with respect.
	- Kanban = sign board to communicate what and how much is needed
	- Stopping the machine when there is trouble forces awareness on everyone. When the problem is clearly understood, improvement is possible.
	- The plant is the manufacturing’s source of major information. It provides the most direct, current, and stimulating information about management. A proper work procedure therefore cannot be written from a desk. It must be tried and revised many times in the production plant.
	- I have said before that I calmly accept the words “slow growth.”
