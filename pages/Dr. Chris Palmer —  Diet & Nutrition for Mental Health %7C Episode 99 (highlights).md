	- CB1 Receptors on Mitochondrials Play a Role in Memory Impairment
	  
	  Summary:
	  Mitochondria actually have CB1 receptors right on them, and various researchers,. a couple of studies from nature actually documented this. The mitochondria also seem to play a role in the memory impairment that can be induced from THC. They also play arole in the kind of lack of motivation, the behavioral, a motivational state from THC.

	  Done. So mitochondria actually have CB1 receptors right on them, and various researchers, a couple of studies from nature actually documented this, that the mitochondrial CB1 receptors are primary points of the influence of marijuana on human behaviors and effects. So because when they remove CB1 receptors and animal models, these changes don't happen. So the CB1 receptors, we've got some large studies of adolescents who use a lot of marijuana in the areas where the mitochondria have the greatest numbers of CB1 receptors are areas of their brains that actually are atrophied or shrunk compared to normal, healthy controls. So that means their brain tissue is aging prematurely, it's shrinking prematurely. But the CB1 receptors on mitochondria also seem to play a role in the memory impairment that can be induced from THC, and they also play a role in the kind of lack of motivation, the behavioral, a motivational state from THC. Now again, for people who want to chillax, that's what they're looking for. They don't want to remember anything, they don't want to think, they want to be spaced out, they want to relax.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  That's great.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  But it's important that they know that they're actually harming the mitochondria in their brain cells, and that although there's always an opportunity to repair mitochondria and always an opportunity to repair mitochondria, or maybe there's always an opportunity to stimulate mitochondria biogenesis so you can get it back.
