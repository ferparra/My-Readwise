- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Dec 19th, 2022]]
	- Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills. How to navigate the landscape. And who has right-of-way on the trail.
	- A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles, was a great piece of fiction that shows that you can be true to your word, and experience a good life despite whatever is thrown your way.  Beautiful prose too.
	- Sand Talk by Tyson Yunkaporta, a primer on how Aboriginal Australian cultures view time, chaos and interactions.  Good reminder that there are multiple ways of creating a narrative about the world that may or may not be more sophisticated then your own culture.
	- Tools of Conviviality by Ivan Illich, reaffirmed my belief that technology shapes our culture, and some technologies create artificial monopolies that push out more humane options.
	- Evolution in Four Dimensions: Genetic, Epigenetic, Behavioral, and Symbolic Variation in the History of Life by Eva Jablonka and Marion J. Lamb is a wonderfully instructive book on the multiple way in which biology evolves and can pass on information beyond just genetics alone.
	- The Listening Society by Hanzi Freinacht, a good introduction on the progression of culture, and where do we go after post modernism, and why it is difficult to do so.
