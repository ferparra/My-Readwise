	- Executives seek to position their companies strategically to attain
	  a competitive advantage. In the process, they have to consider
	  industry dynamics, including barriers to entry, and figure out how
	  to perform activities differently, or perform different activities, than
	  their competitors.2 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwckz8r1vbwjk220xdq4gz5))
	- Investors often treat analysis of competitive advantage and
	  valuation as separate tasks. But they should be done together. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwcqg0b0z7wsmekmtmhvym7))
	- economic theory tells us that return on investment in excess of the opportunity
	  cost of capital gets eroded by competition ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwcs8g0j3tzw192mf51505s))
	- Strategy seeks to
	  explain sustainable competitive advantage by looking at individual companies and how they differ. Economics
	  tends to treat firms in broader classes, old versus young or incumbent versus challenger, with an emphasis on
	  aggregates. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwcsyh4d69mvsx7ja954m2r))

	- The slower the
	  rate of fade, the longer a company can sustain its competitive advantage. Companies with strong competitive
	  advantages preserve high returns longer than their competitors do.7 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwctzh8wy0ghb92mz8x1wex))
	- defining the market requires judgment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwd09tppbsfte9dnnqx1wjt))
	- Two aspects of market
	  share, stability and concentration, can provide insight into potential sustainable competitive advantage ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwd16yr3pks10h75mrxd9s0))
	- Market share stability is conducive to sustainable competitive advantage, whereas instability makes it more
	  difficult to create value over time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwd1s7d6mw05vmxf7z2q9bb))
	- A couple of factors are particularly important in considering the rate of entry and exit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwd21s6vdz1zgajnv1rgz84))
	- The second factor is the rate of entry. One of the key functions of a capitalist system is to efficiently shift
	  resources from industries that destroy value to those that create value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwd2a0r0qgr0gqwvzezty6c))
	- Regulation, along with the substantial investments in intangibles by big firms,
	  have created large, fixed costs that have impeded the entry and growth of small firms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwd37zws1x6wsyaasztvn4r))
	- Entry by technology firms peaked around
	  2000 and has drifted lower in recent decades. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwd3km3bs3pvxpy53hdgsdh))
	- Market concentration quantifies “the extent to which market shares are concentrated between a small number
	  of firms.”2 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwd45yaqhqm3mw0xrrxpf0p))
	- The relationship between minimum efficient scale (MES) and the total addressable market (TAM) is one way to
	  think about the number of competitors and the degree of potential concentration. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwd4fwjyxyy962d1w788x2f))
	- You should always think about scale relative to competitors. Big firms in a large industry may not have any
	  advantage when compared to one another. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwd4zjt77gzckn6ma0zt4w6))
	- A recent meta-study found that market share is positively linked to financial performance, including metrics such
	  as return on sales, return on investment, and return on equity.3 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwd6zan3brdb625fc37vex3))
	- The central question is how market share translates into a return on investment that exceeds the cost
	  of capital. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwd7bm291v50yrpbpz2qr16))
	- Industries and companies with market power
	  earn an economic profit, a return on investment in excess of the cost of capital. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwd86zb7mnkmwkg4yscvqs0))
	- Oberholzer-Gee argues that companies should strive to increase willingness to pay and to lower willingness to
	  supply. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwd9gcqz42wyqrg4rp47es2))
	- A network effect exists when the value of a good or service increases as more people
	  use the good or service. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwdaadtqf4rt5kx8j5x2yew))
	- Direct network effects exist when
	  members can connect with one another without having to deal with an intermediary. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwdagzhms9js5n5ka0pwbcv))
	- A consumer who is part of a leading network can get locked-in as the result of switching costs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwdb877dm8007nw9scn5qfg))
	- Market share is a predictor of profitability when network effects are on display. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwdbjdrfsn44azqyvqj3nr3))
	- A complement is a good or service that is consumed with another good or service. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwdbzrqz69gms4bd5wpesm7))
	- Firms that offer complements can still compete with one another. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwdcdh6g8kwbdww6nqt0z7w))
	- Higher WTP is associated with goods and services that are more useful, confer
	  more status, and create more consumer pleasure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwdcwk39ve120k4xs0kmpnx))
	- Another method of lifting WTP is reducing search costs. One series of experiments showed that
	  recommendations based on the taste of the participant increased WTP. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwdd6m3htweg06vnn0hsysg))
	- Some consumers purchase goods or services by habit, which are defined by automaticity and a lack of
	  conscious deliberation.61 Habitual behavior differs based on the consumer or category, but research
	  shows that WTP is higher for products purchased by habit.62 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwdddwhta405t5tpchn9e06))
	- Reduce supply cost through data. Most companies have digitalized to some degree, which has
	  improved the ability to capture the preferences and purchase habits of their customers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwddy04szmhg9mm378k95t4))
	- The learning curve, which describes the ability to reduce unit costs as a function of cumulative experience,
	  can also lower cost and WTS. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwdedy0t4pb7ec762ts47mx))
	- Learning curves come
	  from accumulated experience and know-how while economies of scale are the result of larger output as a
	  function of cost. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwdeq4fgv80nxc64wdftbd2))
	- There are a couple of ways a company can increase employee satisfaction, a form
	  of supplier surplus. The first is to pay employees more. This redistributes value from the company to the
	  employees unless there is an offsetting reduction in costs. Some firms pay more than the market rate for
	  employees because it lowers employee turnover, which reduces costs for hiring and training. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwdf4m6cyfjbhcvjr11m2ft))
	- Academics who have studied the link between market share and profitability point to three potential sources of
	  value creation: market power, quality signaling, and operating efficiencies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwdhw7ckmpw7qq8a5abjz7x))
	- Quality signaling is the idea that a
	  company that becomes a market leader provides a signal to a potential consumer that the offering must be good. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwdj1mfexnsva4sbsr0p1vy))
	- A company is said to have market power when it can set the price of its good or service above the marginal
	  cost.74 Economists use a “markup” to measure this market power. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwdjcae9601447m035ah92g))
	- Aggregate markups in the U.S. were flattish from 1955 through 1980 and have climbed steadily since then. In
	  other words, it appears that market power has increased in the last four decades.80 This has coincided with a
	  rise in regulation and robust M&A activity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwedfk5qtqhhh614rj00krv))
	- Companies have always invested in tangible and intangible assets.
	  But intangible investments have grown at a much faster pace than tangible ones over the decades that markups
	  have increased. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpweft32vp04venajx076dz6))
	- Companies with high gross margins and low operating profit margins will have large differences between their
	  unadjusted and adjusted markups. The adjustment has minimal effect on companies with low gross margins and
	  positive operating profit margins. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwejxprmae62mjcp3e4kpmw))
	- One important insight is that superstar firms tend to substantially outspend their competitors on intangible
	  assets.9 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwek73npwnqmsjp7tw882zr))
	- use of software has allowed superstar firms to go beyond simple economies of scale
	  to provide differentiated offerings as well ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpweskf8wmgctkja07vw999c))
	- the sheer complexity of the software and the lack of incentives to share mean that the diffusion of
	  technology is slower now than it was in prior generations. For this reason, it is difficult for competitors to close
	  the productivity gap and the minimum efficient scale for potential challengers is on the rise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwesvk4tjm61rgmmfakzzcn))
	- Ten airlines
	  that existed prior to 2001 have merged into the four major carriers today. JetBlue’s recent agreement to acquire
	  Spirit Airlines continues this trend. Some research finds this consolidation has led to an increase in market power
	  for the airlines.110 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwf188h0ww1f6c00z517jae))
	- Google commands more than 90 percent
	  of the market and its closest competitor is under 3 percent. This is an example of a winner take most market.
	  Google’s revenues are predominately from advertising. As we saw before, a clear market leader increases the
	  willingness to pay of customers, which are in this case the advertisers. While Google does have discretion over
	  the supply of ads it offers, the prices are set via an auction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwf5hzc3bpf1ae1v44nc3yf))
	- Markups attempt to measure market power, or the price a company can charge above marginal cost. Markups
	  are below average for autos and airlines, reflecting the difficulty in achieving scale or differentiation in those
	  industries. Markups are above average for search and word processing as the market leader enjoys advantages
	  on the supply- and demand-side. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwfargg5fbct2q37hsspp2q))
	- Market share instability tends to be unfavorable for sustainable competitive advantage, but market share stability
	  does not ensure it. Industries can be stable near a point of competitive equilibrium, which precludes any
	  meaningful value creation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwfb70wvhf08ed3hnwh33eg))
	- Some industries, such as the global auto industry, are large enough to accommodate a number of companies
	  that operate at minimum efficient scale. This tends to result in industry ROICs that are close to the cost of capital. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwfdxde36ztzefg2zar4479))
	- Market power measures the degree to which a firm can set its price above its marginal cost. A firm with market
	  power creates value by earning a return above its cost of capital. A ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwfe7abxfbxxxn8fyzy1yrf))
	- Some research suggests that superstar firms are those that have invested heavily in proprietary technology that
	  is not shared with other firms. This software allows these businesses to capture scale, manage complexity, and
	  differentiate from competitors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwfep48gr9ep8tz39nnqce3))
