	- What did I manage to do with @RoamResearch after #BASB with what I learned from @fortelabs and in mentor sessions with @uberstuber + great tips from @rroudt of @RoamStack? AðŸ§µof reflection and appreciation for Roam as an awesome tool and those who thought me. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BBashokooh/status/1405613570423984133))

	- PARA+interstitial journaling+time blocking= Zen@work. 
	  I revamped my Roam graph and PC disk space to align them with PARA. Started using name-spacing, created appropriate templates for daily and weekly reviews in Roam. Decluttered disk and added tags to folders and shortcuts ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BBashokooh/status/1405613572105949185))
	- Adopted relentless writing while working. I am taking notes when I have discussions, attend meetings, think of ideas, when summarizing reports and responding to emails. Everything gets a ref according to PARA and an Urgency/Importance ref that I use in compiling weekly task list ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BBashokooh/status/1405613573783658497))
	- Today, It only took me minutes to collect all the necessary references and previous notes related to a project before an important meeting and I could tell when and where and from whom or what source I collected them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BBashokooh/status/1405613575440322561))
	- Never in my years as a knowledge worker I felt so present, so refreshingly focused and so confident in the structure of my understanding of the topic. Instead of a heap of sand that I would have struggled to climb, my notes formed a staircase for an easy ascend. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BBashokooh/status/1405613577042542596))
	- a Roam template that runs every morning, creating time blocks for every hour of the day, I spend some meditative minutes answering some prompt questions, on what I am looking forward to in the day. A smartblock that tells how many days I have been alive, sets me straight. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BBashokooh/status/1405613579374632972))
	- I then time block my calendar using the priorities of the day and based on the prompt questions of divergence or convergence for each project. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BBashokooh/status/1405613581043965957))
	- I have also discovered https://t.co/mdQ0QmLAb7 and their music really helps me focus during blocked sessions of deep work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BBashokooh/status/1405613582637834248))
	- Intermediate Packets= End of the day smiles
	  Since the week when Tiago introduced the IPs, I have created a time block and a prompt question in Roam at the end of my work day: "What are the [[IPs/Intermediate packets]] of today? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BBashokooh/status/1405613584265121793))
	- This is part of daily review where I reference and link to the journal notes of the day. They are automatically linked with projects and areas and create this fascinating progress timeline. Taking notes, elaborating on what is done and what is next is immensely elevating. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BBashokooh/status/1405613585942945795))
