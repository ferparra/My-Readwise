	- I tried zig after reading so many HN articles and I am not impressed. You have to remember to free after each allocation. The language is supposed to be simple, yet there exist try, catch, defer, errdefer. Rust enums make defining errors so simple with arbitrary payload. Using data structures in rust is much nicer. I think unless you have some precise needs about memory allocation, and want to control exactly where when and how memory is allocated, it is hard to argue in favour of Zig. The allocation control is very nice if you need it though. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwjj4hh36jzw8wb32jhc7s6z))
