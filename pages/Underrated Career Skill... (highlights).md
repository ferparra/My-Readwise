	- Underrated career skill â€” Mathematical Intuition
	  
	  7 first principles from MATH to live by: ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Coding_Career/status/1403009256064831491))

	- 1/ The difference between the 0th, 1st & 2nd derivative
	  
	  They're all important, but not equally important. New information comes in all 3 flavors.
	  
	  2nd derivative is most exciting, but noisiest.
	  
	  1st derivative ensures you're on the right path.
	  
	  0th derivative tracks total impact

	- 2/ Logarithmic thinking
	  
	  Most people don't how to estimate, manage, or create exponential growth. But we can add and subtract. 
	  
	  Break down causal factors by taking their logarithm and ask if what you're working on makes a material difference.
	  
	  Big O is a great example.

	- 3/ Limit to Infinity 
	  
	  We often make sweeping statements and create byzantine systems that don't stand up to scrutiny or real life.
	  
	  Reductio ad infinitum: Examine your implicit constraints, uncover nonlinearities, and simplify complexity by imagining extreme scenarios.

	- 4/ Set Theory
	  
	  Disagreements often arise out of differing definitions.
	  
	  We often have more in common than we think with our opponents. Make vague language more precise and discover opportunities, by thinking in Sets and looking for overlap and whitespace.

	- 5/ Graph Theory
	  
	  Everything is a graph. Learn how to abstract the essence of relationships and apply graph traversal algorithms, and network analysis. 
	  
	  Don't bother trying what's already mathematically proven to be impossible.

	- 6/ Principal Components
	  
	  Most metrics of interest have dozens of causes. Principal components analysis helps you reduce dimensionality (this is how you can compress images by 90%!).
	  
	  Understanding the core eigenvectors tells you the key actions to take next.

	- 7/ The Limits of Math
	  
	  Math is internally consistent and provably correct, but it has one GIANT flaw: Assumptions.
	  
	  In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice.
	  
	  In practice, there is.
	  
	  Understand that math fails under reflexive systems and bounded rationality. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Coding_Career/status/1403009332367683586))
