	- Using Aave's highly capital-efficient e-mode, users will be able to leverage more than 10x on their stMATIC, allowing them to earn +10% APR on their MATIC.

	- For users with MATIC collateral or lenders, it'll allow them to earn a 3% lending APR, setting off all their borrowing interest. Making Polygon's Aave highly attractive to borrowers with MATIC collateral.

	- Also, opening an opportunity for @Instadapp Lite to go live on Polygon. Allowing users to tap into these strategies with an oversimplified one-click yield strategy.

	- Lastly, stMATIC can be converted into MATIC at no cost through @LidoFinance with a waiting period of 3-4 days. Making it an extremely stable asset w.r.t MATIC.
