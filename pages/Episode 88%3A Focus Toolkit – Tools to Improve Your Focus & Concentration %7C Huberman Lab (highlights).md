Huberman outlines techniques such as binaural beats, white noise, pink noise and brown noise, as well as fasting and feeding states, cold exposure, visual field exercises and meditation. He also emphasizes the importance of taking breaks, refocusing and timing of meditation.

	- Tip: leverage benefits of stress through cold exposure **–** try a cold shower (uncomfortably cold but safe to stay in) 1-5 minutes to increase epinephrine and dopamine in the brain and body to get the body into a focused state – the positive effects of epinephrine last up to an hour or more ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9jkkvc7mme8hgg141hgca3))
