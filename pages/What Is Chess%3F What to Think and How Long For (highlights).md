document_note:: The document "What is Chess? What to think and how long for" discusses the importance of time management in chess, and how it can be used to improve one's play. It suggests that, on average, a player should spend 2.5% of their time per move, but this amount can be increased for critical moves. It also outlines the process for thinking about a move, including considering whether it is critical and whether it fits in with the player's plans. Finally, the document states that for beginners, slow time controls are important in order to develop better thought patterns.
