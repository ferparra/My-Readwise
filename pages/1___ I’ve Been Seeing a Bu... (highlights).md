	- 1/ I‚Äôve been seeing a bunch of chatter and confusion around @0xPolygon lately so I wanted to put together a thread breaking it all down to clear the air.
	  
	  Hopefully it helps üôè ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663935823859712))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 2/ Firstly, I want to go over why I joined Polygon as an advisor - there are 3 key reasons:
	- 3/ (cont)
	- 4/ Okay, now let‚Äôs talk about what products Polygon currently has in production.
	  
	  There is the Matic Plasma Chain and the Polygon PoS chain.
	  
	  The vast majority of the activity is happening on the PoS chain so I will focus on that in this thread. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663940752240642))
	- 5/ The PoS chain is what people refer to as a ‚Äúsidechain‚Äù to Ethereum because it has its own permissionless validator set (100+ who are staking MATIC) which means it doesn‚Äôt use Ethereum‚Äôs security (aka Ethereum‚Äôs PoW).
	  
	  Though, this doesn‚Äôt paint a complete technical picture. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663942375411718))
	- 6/ The PoS chain goes beyond a standard sidechain and actually relies on and commits itself to Ethereum (what some people may call a ‚Äúcommit-chain‚Äù).
	  
	  It relies on Ethereum because all of the validator/staking logic for the PoS chain lives as a smart contract on Ethereum. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663943973396484))
	- 7/ This means that if the Ethereum network went offline, the Polygon PoS chain would also go offline.
	  
	  Secondly, the PoS chain actually commits/checkpoints itself to Ethereum every so often. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663945663770626))
	- 8/ This has 2 benefits: it provides Ethereum-based finality to the PoS chain & it can help the chain recover in case of catastrophic event.
	  
	  This also means that Polygon is paying Ethereum to use its blockspace (in ETH) & paying for it to secure the contracts & checkpointing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663947278569478))
	- 9/ Alright now we need to talk about the 2-way bridges that exist between Ethereum and Polygon.
	  
	  There are 2 bridges - the Plasma bridge which is secured by Ethereum and the PoS bridge which is secured/operated by the PoS chain validator set. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663948931137538))
	- 10/ Of course, for the PoS bridge, 2/3 of the validators could theoretically collude and try to steal the bridge funds but there‚Äôs $3.4 billion at stake so this is risky.
	  
	  If this attack did happen, the checkpointing & social coordination could be the only recourse. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663950545948673))
	- 11/ Lastly, let‚Äôs talk about the multi-sigs for Polygons contracts.
	  
	  The multi-sigs exist to allow the contract to be upgraded in case of a bug/exploit which is a practice used by many existing projects (especially those within DeFi). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663952215248896))
	- 12/ However, Polygon's multi-sigs are 5 of 8 which is definitely not ideal and not decentralized and the plan is to greatly improve this in the near future.
	  
	  For more info on this, read the thread below.

	- 13/ Now, you may be thinking, ‚Äúwell this sounds similar to sidechains like BSC so why would Anthony support the Polygon PoS chain but rag on BSC?‚Äù
	  
	  Well my friends, this is where I explain my reasoning and you get to decide if you think I‚Äôm a hypocrite or not :) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663955671388162))
	- 14/ Polygon is committed to building & deploying L2 solutions like rollups in the future - this is what I‚Äôm personally most excited about.
	  
	  But generalized EVM-compatible L2 solutions (that you can build anything on) aren‚Äôt where we want them to be today (hopefully soon though)! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663957617516546))
	- 15/ This EVM-compatibility is the key driver behind the PoS chains adoption.
	  
	  Yes, it‚Äôs less secure than a rollup solution but it is production ready *today*! 
	  
	  Users aren't going to sit around and wait - we‚Äôve seen that they will go to other parasitic chains like BSC. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663959270072322))
	- 16/ So, following this logic, why not onboard users to something that is technically, socially and politically aligned with Ethereum rather than something that is openly hostile and parasitic (such as BSC)? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663960943632384))
	- 17/ BSC doesn‚Äôt commit itself to Ethereum, it doesn‚Äôt have a permissionless validator set, its staking logic is not run on Ethereum and CZ is openly hostile towards Ethereum. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663962562547717))
	- 18/ Last note - it seems many people still underestimate just how important the social layer of all of these systems are.
	  
	  Who do you think is writing the code, running the nodes, building the products and setting the narratives/memes?
	  
	  It‚Äôs all humans - always has been! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663964190003200))
	- 19/ I hope that this thread has been informative and helps to clear up some of the confusion I‚Äôve seen on Twitter around Polygon lately.
	  
	  Obviously as an advisor I am compensated for my work in MATIC tokens (which are locked and vested over multiple years). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1394663965829992451))
	- 20/ Final thing - @finematics produced an excellent video covering the Polygon PoS chain that I highly recommend you all go watch (it has some more info that I didn't include in this thread).
