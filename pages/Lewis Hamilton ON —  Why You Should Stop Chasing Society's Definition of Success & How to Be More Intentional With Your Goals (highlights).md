	  But making sure you stick to your core values is so true. So it goes back to what you said though, that that's what real leaders do. Like leaders don't follow what's trending. Like leaders are focused on transformation and then they're dedicated to transformation and they're going to keep doing it until they see a change, whereas followers follow trends. And it's not trending now, it doesn't matter. We'll focus on something else. But you know, obviously it's so clear. Just listening to you today. And it's amazing because, and that's why I'm so glad I've had this opportunity to talk to you because I can hear just how deeply dedicated you are to this and how it's at your core. It's like, it's everything that comes out of your pause today is just, you know, which is really special to see a value being embodied, like to empower other people, you have to embody the value first. It doesn't just, you don't just go around empowering people. And so to hear how your soul and heart is like completely a sponge for this stuff and then to wanting to go and share it with the world, it's really remarkable. Yeah, thank you.

It's about just every day, one step at a time, trying to be better, trying to do more and learning a lot about myself, I had to break myself down in order to be out to be better. And what do you mean by breaking yourself down? Well, just when you, when I told you about like all those barriers you put up and protect yourself and then kind of like knocking those barriers down. And it's enabled me to connect with more people. It's enabled me to realize my place in the world. And I don't feel like I don't belong anymore. I feel like, you know, I've got a place and I've got a purpose. And that's, and I think a lot of people are struggling to find that purpose, but it's okay. You will find it. Do not give up. Keep getting up. ([Time 1:00:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a8d0e4a0-dafc-41b0-9726-d1af772954ba))
