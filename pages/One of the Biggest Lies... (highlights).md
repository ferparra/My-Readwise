	- One of the biggest lies in modern software engineering is referring to "waterfall", then using this as an excuse to not do *any* form of (written) planning.
	  
	  The "Waterfall" referred has died out in the majority of the industry. The "plan for 6 months, ship in 3 years" kind. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1574063337318617089))

	- "Waterfall" was a thing in the 90s, or in environments where writing a spec of hundreds of pages, written over many, many months (6+ months) was common.
	  
	  Unless you're unlucky to work in some strange part of the industry, this is a thing of the past. "Waterfall" is now a myth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1574063755322957834))
	- When I describe how modern sw eng organizations get stuff done - think: Twitter, Facebook, Google, Shopify, Uber etc etc - the response I get is "wow that sounds like waterfall"
	  
	  No, it's not. Planning for days, then shipping every day is NOT waterfall.
