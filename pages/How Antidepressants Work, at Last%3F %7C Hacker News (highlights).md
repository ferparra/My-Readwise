	- anxiety is persistent overestimation of risks which persist despite regular experiences of dangerous risks not happening which should lead to learning (but doesn't). So if boosts to [[neuroplasticity]] can help a depressive learn that life doesn't suck, it makes sense if boosts could also help an anxious person learn that life isn't so dangerous.
	- in addition to other meds I'm also on Modafinil. This is mainly to combat fatigue side effects, but modafinil is also a very good (for me at least) anti-depressant. I'm depressed less often on it, and when depressed it keeps me much more functional.
