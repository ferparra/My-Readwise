	- One of the most amazing discoveries of 20th-century physics: particles are waves.   The wavelength of a particle is Planck's constant divided by its momentum!
	  
	  An electron moving at 1 meter/second has very little momentum, so its wavelength is almost a millimeter.

	- Why am I tweeting about this?  Because I want to explain and simplify the formula for the entropy of a particle in a box.  
	  
	  Even though I derived it classically, it contains Planck's constant!  So, it will become more intuitive if we think a bit about quantum mechanics.

	- This week we'll see an intuitive explanation for our formula of the entropy of a particle in a 1d box.   We'll use this intuition to simplify our formula!
	  
	  That will make it easier to generalize to N particles in a 3d box - our ultimate goal.
