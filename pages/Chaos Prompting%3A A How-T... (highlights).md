	- Step 1: Let's create Chaos.
	  
	  Go to Chat-GPT, and ask for something like the following.
	  
	  Here's how I got a solid prompt, starting with:
	  
	  "give me a completely random string of words that are descriptors for a scene" which leads to a full scale prompt.

	- Step 2: Let's guide Chaos.
	  
	  I put this directly into Midjourney, V5, only adding --s 1000 + 2:3
	  
	  Full prompt: "Electric clouds levitating over twinkling neon lights, while bustling pedestrian traffic and distant sirens provide a pulsating shadow to suspended time..." (1/3)

	- Cascading colors blend with fleeting memories, and ethereal whispers mix with fragmented emotions, as delicate lace meets levitating crystals. Elusive dreams intertwine with intricate networks, while abstruse theories ponder philosophical quandaries. Through it all... (2/3)

	- whispering winds carry the scent of sizzling street food, blooming petals, and the ethereal mist that permeates this surreal and intellectual scene --s 1000 --ar 2:3" (3/3)

	- Step 3: Now... W E  B L E N D .
	  
	  I love these, but... you know me and you know I have to throw some weird , abstract dark surrealism sprinkles on top.
	  
	  First attempt at blending, using a main ingredient for "Penumbra". I love the drips, and this is cool, but not really *enough*

	- I want something more 'street' centric, so I ran a new set of images from another prompt + blend mash (1) and blended it with one of the results from our Chaos prompt (2)

	- Here's one of the results:
	  
	  A softer, less harsh but more abstract version that is narrative driven appears.

	- Midjourney is super versatile, especially when switching versions. These were V5, but--
	  
	  I typically like V4 for blending; I like the flatter colors and more dynamic subject matter, even though it brings with it imperfections.
	  
	  So, here's the results from the same combo in V4

	- annnnnnnd here's the result I'm the happiest with!
	  
	  This allowed me to create in a way I've never done before and produce a finished product that I would not have discovered otherwise.
	  
	  More importantly, it still has a piece of me in it, my expression and my direction/guidance.

	- What will you create with this process? Feel free to share here or tag me in results!
	  
	  Shoutout to @anim8dead, @jeffjag, @JenPanepinto and @adultarts for the crazy conversation this morning on their space that lead me to this concept for a different workflow.
	  
	  Happy Friday âœŠðŸ’€ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bl_artcult/status/1644413276602912768))
