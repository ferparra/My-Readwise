	  Now, I want to talk about what comfort does. When you stay in comfort, it's interesting because it creates something and what it creates is complacency. And I want to give a scaled up example of this. So I read a book a few years ago. It's a book that truly changed my life. It's called Exponential Organizations. And it's all about how the greatest companies in the world think exponentially. And so this was one of the first books that talked about the idea that Airbnb has access to more real estate than any hotel company in the world. Uber has access to more vehicles than any car service. Instagram has more access to media but doesn't make any. Think about that. In 10 to 20 years, these companies have achieved what it's taken companies 50 plus years to achieve. And a lot of these companies achieved that within their first 10 years. It's unbelievable because there was a lot of complacency and comfort from all these other companies where these other organizations, these exponential organizations were able to supersede and move super fast past them. And comfort and complacency creates this stagnation. And there's two sentences that are always quoted as being frames of mind that hold us back. And there's seven word phrases. One of them is we have always done it that way. I have always done it that way. I always do it that way, right? How many times does that thought come up into your mind or in your language? Or have, yeah, I know how to do that. We've always done that, right? And the other one that we say a lot is if it's not broken, don't fix it. If it's not broken, just counting, don't fix it, right? Like those two statements create comfort and complacency. So what I want you to do right now is I want you to reflect where in your life are you starting to see comfort creep in? Because that's the other thing about comfort. It doesn't break in. Comfort creeps in. ([TimeÂ 0:09:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4f9ffd6e-a951-499d-bd19-17605f0badc5))
