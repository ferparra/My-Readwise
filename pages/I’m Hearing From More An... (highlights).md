	- I’m hearing from more and more teams who tried creating an opportunity solution tree and got stuck or gave up. 
	  
	  If this is you, you aren’t alone. 
	  Opportunity mapping is hard. Let’s dig into why. 🧵 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ttorres/status/1615148155883978758))

	- Before we can map an opportunity space, we need to learn how to:
	  1⃣ Identify relevant opportunities
	  2⃣ Frame those opportunities properly
	  3⃣ And finally, uncover the hidden structure of the opportunity space.
	  
	  Only then does the opportunity map start to fall into place. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ttorres/status/1615148408792309762))
	- Too many teams generate opportunities from thin air. They capture what they think their customers need, want, or desire. 
	  
	  This is easy to do. Every product has some knowledge about their customers. 
	  
	  But it’s a classic 🗑️garbage in, 🗑️garbage out situation. Here’s why … ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ttorres/status/1615148649402474502))
	- An actionable opportunity is specific. 
	  
	  ✅It occurs in a specific moment in time. 
	  ✅It occurs in a specific context. 
	  ✅It is experienced by a specific customer. 
	  
	  It’s hard to generate these specifics off the top of your head. 
	  
	  Let's compare a couple of examples: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ttorres/status/1615148870295601153))
	- 1⃣ I can’t find something to watch
	  2⃣ I want to watch Avatar, but I don’t know what streaming service it’s available on.
	  3⃣ I like intriguing sci/fi but not dumb action films. I can’t tell if I’ll like this movie. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ttorres/status/1615149253243830272))
	- 1⃣ is what we get when we try to generate opportunities off the top of our head.
	  
	  We could spend the rest of our lives trying to solve for 1⃣. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ttorres/status/1615149384609501191))
	- 2⃣ and 3⃣, on the other hand, are more specific. And much more actionable. I suspect many of you can think of several good solutions for 2⃣ and 3⃣.
	  
	  That’s the power of a well-framed opportunity. It opens up the solution space. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ttorres/status/1615149611743600643))
	- But where do these specific opportunities come from?
	  We can’t simply pull them out of thin air. We can’t make them up.
	  
	  Instead, we need to collect them. We need to interview our customers. We need to ask the right questions.
	  
	  Opportunities emerge from customer stories. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ttorres/status/1615149719898017793))
	- When we collect stories about specific past behavior, we get context. We get nuance. We get specifics. And most importantly, we get actionable opportunities. 
	  
	  But collecting stories isn’t easy. It’s a skill we need to practice and develop. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ttorres/status/1615149804824268800))
	- If I ask, “Tell me about the last time you watched TV”, you’ll likely respond, “I watched a show last night after dinner.”
	  
	  That’s not a very good story. 
	  
	  My job as the interviewer is to help you tell your story. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ttorres/status/1615149885564518401))
	- I need to help situate you in that moment. I need to help you remember the details. I need to assure you I want all the details. I need to excavate the story step by step. 
	  
	  And my reward for doing this is opportunities emerge from detailed stories about specific past behavior. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ttorres/status/1615149999158878208))
	- If you are new to story-based interviewing, it will take time (and practice) to get good at this. 
	  
	  But when we get good at story-based interviewing, we solve the 🗑️garbage in, 🗑️garbage out challenge with opportunity mapping. 
	  
	  Opportunity mapping gets easier. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ttorres/status/1615150136774037506))

	- A well-framed opportunity is specific. 
	  
	  ✅It occurs during a specific moment in time. 
	  ✅It occurs in a specific context. 
	  ✅It’s experienced by a specific customer.
	  
	  These specifics emerge from customers’ stories. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ttorres/status/1615150581479505920))
