	  We have different personalities. There is a personality test that's called the big five. And this is the most widely used personality test. There are five different dimensions in this test. There's extraversion, there's agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience. It turns out that people who score high on the dimension of neuroticism tend to have the shortest attention span. What is neuroticism? When a person is neurotic, they tend to be more susceptible to stress. They tend to reanalyze past events over and over in their minds. So you had a, let's say you had a conflict with your colleague and you keep replaying that over and over in your mind. This kind of continuous replay in our minds uses up a lot of our cognitive resources. And when we're using our cognitive resources in that way, there's less resources to actually apply to looking at that information in front of you. So there's fewer attentional resources available to devote to the current activity. So what people who are neurotics tend to have shorter attention spans. There's another personality facet that's called urgency. And that's related to being impulsive. So when a person scores high in this, what's called urgency, they're impulsive in the short term. They can't restrain themselves. They just have to react on, on whims. And it turns out that people who score high in this area also tend to have shorter attention spans. So and you know, one reason is that if you're impulsive in this sense, in this short term way, you just can't restrain yourself from responding to distractions. Now, you know, we looked at those results in our research and we also looked at people's susceptibility to stress. And we find that there's a personality trait when we put all this together that I call lack of control. And this does suggest that there is a personality trait that's associated with distractedness that's correlated with having short attention spans on our screens.
