	- @AdamMGrant Well summarized for Twitter. 
	  
	  I can’t help but notice similar trend is in self-help industry. 
	  
	  Popular tropes like: 
	  “your feelings are valid” 
	  And 
	  “Never explain yourself to anyone” 
	  
	  Are becoming excuses for emotionally lashing out on others (ie oversharing on social media). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jordannepavao/status/1490337713173987328))
