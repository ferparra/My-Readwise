	- The unbalanced brain chemical in question is serotonin, an important neurotransmitter with fabled “feel-good” effects. Serotonin helps regulate systems in the brain that control everything from body temperature and sleep to sex drive and hunger. For decades, it has also been touted as the pharmaceutical MVP for fighting depression. Widely prescribed medications like Prozac (fluoxetine) are designed to treat chronic depression by raising serotonin levels.

	- no convincing evidence that lower levels of serotonin caused or were even associated with depression ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqr69nfpzzsnjm4k85j0df6z))

	- the serotonin hypothesis still has adherents. Last October — just a few months after their review appeared — a [paper published online](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2022.10.012) in *Biological Psychiatry* claimed to offer a concrete validation of the serotonin theory. Other researchers remain skeptical, however, because the study looked at only 17 volunteers. Moncrieff dismissed the results as statistically insignificant.

	- researchers have identified genes that underlie a huge spectrum of disorders, including [about 200 genes](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-021-00860-2) that have been linked to a risk of depression. (Several hundred more genes have been identified as possibly raising the risk.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqr6czhbmdx3t3xpra0m1113))

	- “There’s a false distinction that is sometimes drawn between environmental factors and genetic factors,” said [Srijan Sen](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/srijan-sen-md-phd), a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan. “For most common traits of interest, both genetic and environmental factors play a critical role.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqr6gd4rna8hjz3h5w4apyhw))

	- Environmental influences like stress can also sometimes give rise to “epigenetic” changes to a genome that affect subsequent gene expression. For example, Sen’s laboratory studies epigenetic changes in the caps on the ends of chromosomes, known as telomeres, which affect cell division. Other labs look at changes in chemical tags called methylation groups that can turn genes on or off. Epigenetic changes can sometimes even be passed down through generations. “The effects of the environment are just as biological as the effects of genes,” Sen said. “Just the source is different.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqr6hhtrrbv2e6nfvmna46sy))

	- “Neuroplasticity means that the brain actually is able to create new connections, to change its wiring,” Repple said. If depression occurs when a brain has too few interconnections or loses some, then harnessing neuroplastic effects to increase interconnectedness might help lift a person’s mood.

	- Perhaps the depressed patients’ brain connections were impaired by inflammation. Chronic inflammation impedes the body’s ability to heal, and in neural tissue it can gradually degrade synaptic connections. The loss of such connections is thought to contribute to mood disorders.

	- cytokines — molecules that facilitate reactions ranging from mild swelling to septic shock. The sudden influx of inflammatory cytokines leads to appetite loss, fatigue and a slowdown in mental and physical activity — all symptoms of major depression. Patients taking interferon often report feeling suddenly, sometimes severely, depressed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqr6qgx3nbzqkcq6rmf26f3z))
