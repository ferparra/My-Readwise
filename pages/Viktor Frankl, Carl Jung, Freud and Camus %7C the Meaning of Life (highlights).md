- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 18th, 2022]]
	- man should not ask what the meaning of life is but rather should recognize that it is he who is asked, it is man who is questioned by life itself not man questioning life, if done in the former, no answer will be found
	- “what is the meaning of life” but rather: “what does life mean to me?”
	- Responsibility is therefore the essence of human existence.
	- psychological therapeutic doctrine called: Logotherapy whereby Logo’s in greek means: Meaning, therefore: Meaning Therapy.
	- Freud believed in the will to pleasure and Adler believed in the will to power.
	- Man, however, is able to live and even to die for the sake of his ideals and values!”
	- he Collective Neurosis which is that of nihilism with the belief that being itself has no meaning
	- Frankl saw that the fatalistic conditioning of science on mankind would only make the nihilistic neurotic believe themselves as a pawn and victim of outer and inner influences and circumstances, thus, denying man’s freedom and making the existential vacuum ever so bigger
	- but saw (with insight from the holocaust) that man IS capable of defying and braving the worst conditions conceivable, even those with the sole intent to destroy
	- all dependent on how much one withstands to bear in the search for meaning, thus, within the will to meaning there is a degree of freedom
	- The way in which logotherapy deviates from psychoanalysis is that it considers man as a being whose main concern consists in fulfilling a meaning, rather then in the mere gratification and satisfaction of drives and instincts, or in merely reconciling the conflicting claims of id, ego and superego, or in the mere adaptation and adjustment to society and enviroment.
	- “he who has a WHY can bear almost any HOW”
	- “not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task”
	- that man has to make a choice puts the prospect of paradise and security at a halt
	- “No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism)”
	- Depression, Agression & Addiction, this is what you could call the mass neurotic triad of the people but this is what Frankl saw as result of the existential vacuum of the 20th century, all three of these have nothing but sky rocketed since the appearance the existential vacuum.

	- existential frustration often eventuates to sexual compensation
	- Camus makes the proposition of: revolt against suicide, freedom against ideology & passion for living without hope
	- frankl does view that there are 3 fundamental, objective ways in which we find meaning in life, that is through: Deed, Love and Suffering.
	- The meaning of love is located in the ability for another person to release the beloved’s  potentialities into the mind so that they become actualized
	- Suffering on the other hand can give rise to meaning when a personal tragedy is turned into a triumph
	- the realisation and understanding of suffering gives an artist the pure groundwork to produce a beautifully tragic painting
	- So by changing the attitude in how we see despair we can uproot a meaning which gives a purpose to our existence.
	- So by changing the attitude in how we see despair we can uproot a meaning which gives a purpose to our existence.
	- “Man cannot stand a meaningless life. The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it. It is only the things we don’t understand that have any meaning. Man woke up in a world he did not understand, and that is why he tries to interpret it. About a third of my cases are suffering from no clinically definable neurosis, but from the senselessness and emptiness of their lives. This can be defined as the general neurosis of our times.”
