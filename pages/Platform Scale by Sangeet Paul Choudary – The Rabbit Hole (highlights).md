	- Platform scale is achieved by maximizing the repeatability and efficiency of the platform’s core interaction.
	- 5 drivers of platform scale – minimal marginal costs of production and distribution, network effects powered by positive feedback, behavior design and community culture, learning filters, virality
	- Community management is the new human resources management
	- Liquidity management is the new inventory control
	- Curation and reputation are the new quality control
	- User journeys are the new sales funnels
	- Start with defining the value that is created or consumed, the core value unit
	  The core interaction – the set of actions that enable the creation and consumption of that value – should be laid out around the core value unit
	  The design of the platform’s features, functionalities and management should stem from the design of the core interaction
	- Real-time customization is the new market research
	- Build platforms with an interaction-first, not a technology-first mindset! Technology should be built only after understanding the interaction that needs to be enabled. Without this in mind, one often ends up with a platform that nobody wants to use.
	- Faking initial supply may often help kick start network effects (YouTube had pirated content early on) – seeding and weeding, seeding demand, seeding supply
	- Identifying a group of power producers and providing them with tools and incentives to better “harvest” their following can solve the chicken and egg problem very effectively
	- Get more difficult side on board through curation and incentives
	- Often, the solution to finding adoption lies in providing backward compatibility with existing solutions
	- Bump – non-sustainable exposure such as PR, advertising and events; important for initial traction
	  Engines – an internal engine of growth and designed to grow as a consequence of usage
	  Also needs to create the hooks and motivations that will enable and incentive users to expose the offering to others, every time they use it
	- virality a consequence of users using the platform, not loving the offering. Virality does not need fans, it merely needs users who are encouraged to bring in other users
	- Value creation still dependent on aggregation, but not of labor or resources. Rather, the ecosystem is the new warehouse, supply chain and scale through network effects. Shift from culture of absorption to data absorption. Manage community incentives and governance
	- Platform strategy involves 3 primary priorities, aligned with the three layers of the platform stack – pull, facilitate, match
