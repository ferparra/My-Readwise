	- Before I dive in, just a quick heads-up that we are live on Product Hunt  🥳  would really appreciate your support!

	- Some context: Earlier this week, I launched DomainsGPT as a ChatGPT Plugin.
	  
	  However, since a lot of folks still don't have access to Plugins, I decided to rebuild this as a standalone product for my side project, https://t.co/7lv0YYHLLm 😁

	- With DomainsGPT, you can choose from different name types:
	  
	  ◆ Portmanteau → Vercel (Versatile + Excel)
	  ◆ Word Combination → YouTube
	  ◆ Brandable names → Google
	  ◆ Non-english names → Toyota
	  ◆ Mispellings → Lyft
	  
	  Or you can just let the AI freestyle it out 🙃 https://t.co/W6YmvRHeQE ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/steventey/status/1641452387775954945))
	- You can then provide more context about what you're building (optional).
	  
	  You can also specify a word to include in your name, e.g. "open" (Opendoor, OpenAI, Opensea) and the position it should be in.
	  
	  Actual results: "OpenLush", "OpenFreshy" → not too shabby! https://t.co/jNnzKylCf2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/steventey/status/1641452449646129152))
	- How this works:
	  
	  1. Convert user-selected options into a prompt
	  2. Feed the prompt into @OpenAI's API
	  3. Stream the response and check for availability in real-time using @Vercel Edge Functions: https://t.co/LDtj8ARoij
	  
	  Bonus: give each name a nice font + gradient and...voilà 😍 https://t.co/AdSNjrizSv ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/steventey/status/1641452502070734848))
	- Fun fact: This is actually not the first time I tried to make an AI name generator.
	  
	  2 years ago, I built something similar using Markov Chains, as part of my undergrad thesis on NLP.
	  
	  Now that there's @OpenAI, I decided to give this another shot 🤩

	- To prevent abuse, each user will get 10 credits for free, which gives you 10 generations.
	  
	  With a lifetime pass ($99), you'll get 1,000 credits + lifetime access to the rest of the https://t.co/7lv0YYHLLm data.
	  
	  Excited to see what kinds of names y'all come up with! 🙈 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/steventey/status/1641452510329311232))
	- Wanted to also give some shoutouts to the following tools that made the product experience 10x better:
	  
	  ◆ @tinybirdco for analytics
	  ◆ @upstash for rate-limiting
	  ◆ @fontshare_com for the amazing fonts
	  ◆ @PopsyHQ for the awesome illustrations https://t.co/p9OYSMy2Yt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/steventey/status/1641452513336635402))
	- @tod @OpenAI @vercel Should be fixed now! https://t.co/1jrJgZLMz2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/steventey/status/1641488905940742145))
