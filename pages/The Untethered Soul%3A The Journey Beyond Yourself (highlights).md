document_note:: The Untethered Soul explores ways to free oneself from limitations and find inner peace and serenity. It emphasizes that external movements are striving to make ourselves feel good, and that nothing that happens is personal. Additionally, it suggests not to resist life, but to surrender resistance to life, and to recognize thoughts as padding, rather than ruling one's life. It ultimately encourages one to accept all of life's experiences, to change reactions to reality rather than fight it, and to recognize and let go of emotions.
