	- In one of my favorite books (Thinking as a Science) the author makes the argument that someone might be "prejudiced but not intolerant" but also"intolerant but not prejudiced".

	- 2/ A man may be prejudiced but not intolerant. You might think your school  is the best (without basing it on pure reason) but if you do not protest when someone else expresses the opinion that his school is the best then you are not intolerant.

	- 3/ A man may be intolerant but not prejudiced. He may have arrived at an opinion with pure reason and be against anyone that believes differently, even believe those people should be suppressed. The reason is... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michalisanto/status/1445637755770310658))
	- 4/Even though he may be able to address all of the opponent's arguments he fears that if the other person airs his views they will take hold on
	  minds as shallow as his own. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michalisanto/status/1445637758211424261))
	- 5/ Which i guess is related to "The amount of effort it takes to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude greater than the effort it takes to produce it". What are some forms of prejudice (from the book): ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michalisanto/status/1445637760514072587))
	- 6/ We desire an opinion to be right because we would be personally benefited if it were. A rich man will oppose socialism maybe not because of pure reason but because if this system was adopted it would hurt them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michalisanto/status/1445637762535723009))
	- 7/If we are ignorant about a certain thing we'll be prejudiced against it, if we are experts prejudiced for it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michalisanto/status/1445637764590948356))
	- 8/We desire an opinion to be right because we already happen to hold it. We form our opinions on the slightest evidence but are inclined to cling to them with grim tenacity. We usually communicate our opinions so we have committed ourselves to that side.  For this reason... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michalisanto/status/1445637766721654785))
	- 9/Darwin kept memos of contrary evidence to his theories because these tend to slip off mind more easily. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michalisanto/status/1445637769108201473))
	- 10/We desire an opinion to be wrong because we would be forced to change other opinions if it were not.  Like opinions formed without thought:
	  e.g some religious people and evolution. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michalisanto/status/1445637771507298304))
	- 11/We adopt the opinion of others because we fear to disagree. Some times we prefer our beliefs to be factually false but socially accurate. We adopt our social circle's beliefs to fit in rather than go for truth and feel alone. We choose friends and family over facts.

	- 12/ As put by @sapinker "People are embraced or condemned according to their beliefs, so one function of the mind may be to hold beliefs that bring the belief-holder the greatest number of allies, protectors, or disciples, rather than beliefs that are most likely to be true.‚Äù ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michalisanto/status/1445637775772950531))
	- 13/ And finally there are those that strive to be entirely different. So they hold an opinion just because it goes against the mainstream. The danger here is that if you make originality and radicalness your aim you end up attaining neither truth nor originality. Whereas ...

	- 14/If you make truth your aim you  will get truth and originality will come of itself. "The only way to rid ourselves of the desire to cling on to prejudices is to convince ourselves of the superiority of the truth-hyperrealism".
