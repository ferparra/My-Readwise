	- As a structural biologist I am frequently frustrated by the lack of accuracy with which the DNA double helix is depicted. It's an iconic structure, yet so easy to get wrong. In icons, logos, illustrations, decorations, and unfortunately too often condoned by scientists. (1/15) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ditlevbrodersen/status/1434160751258779652))

	- This may seem like a geeky and detail-oriented rant, but as molecular biologists, the structure of DNA is our most treasured artefact, our holy shrine onto which everything else is built. We simply _cannot_ afford to mess it up. (2/15) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ditlevbrodersen/status/1434160825913253891))
	- As scientists, we should always strive to make illustrations as accurate as possible and never depict something we know is wrong. That would correspond to wearing a t-shirt with the text "We never went to the moon", or "Vaccines don't work". (3/15). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ditlevbrodersen/status/1434160868330250241))
	- So therefore, I decided to create this thread that goes through the basics of depicting DNA in a scientifically sane manner. It's so easy to get wrong but it's also so easy to get right, so why not do it right!? Here goes... (4/15) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ditlevbrodersen/status/1434160906024493061))
	- Before moving on, I want to make it clear what we are talking about. DNA is no one thing. It's a highly dynamic and flexible molecule that adapts to a wide range of biological situations. So, what I will talk about here is the idealised B-form DNA model. (5/15) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ditlevbrodersen/status/1434160948240134146))
	- This model was famously described by Francis Crick and James Watson in their 1953 Nature paper and based on fibre diffraction data by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins at King's College, London. (6/15) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ditlevbrodersen/status/1434160984978042888))
	- First of all, DNA is a double helical molecule. That means, it consists of two strands that run in opposite directions (5'-3' and 3'-5'). While there are reports of triple DNA helices with an additional intercalating strand, this is a rare sight. (7/15)

	- And here comes the difficult one: The helix is _right-handed_! Even professors get this wrong, but it's actually quite easy and we all learned how to check that this is the case during 1st year physics: It's also called the "right hand curl rule". (8/15) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ditlevbrodersen/status/1434161105878798336))
	- It goes like this: Imagine grabbing the helix with the curved fingers of your right hand in such a way that these fingers follow one of the two strands as it curves around the other strand. Then your thumb should be pointing in the direction of the curved motion. (9/15)

	- Contrary to what many believe, this is an intrinsic feature of the helix. Thus, it doesn't matter how the helix is oriented, and it doesn't matter what strand you use. As long as the helix is right-handed, this will work. (10/15) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ditlevbrodersen/status/1434161200657571848))
	- Next, the base pairs (C-G and A-T). These are _perpendicular_ to the helical axis, i.e. the length of the DNA double helix. This is not the case for A-form, such as RNA helices, but for B-form DNA this is the configuration. (11/15)

	- Finally, and this is wrong in most representations of DNA: There _must_ be 10 base pair steps per full helical turn, i.e. two crossings of the strands. No more, no less. The creativity is often large here, and I've seen up to 20 bp per turn in some figures. (12/15)

	- Oh, and grooves: DNA has two regular and alternating grooves of different sizes when viewed from the side, the Major (Ma) groove and the minor (mi) groove. Many representations of DNA lack this detail but it's critical to the function. (13/15)

	- So, how will I ever get all this right, you might ask? A good place to start is by using an online tool such as 3DNA to generate a perfect DNA, prepare a figure in PyMOL, and then taking it from there: https://t.co/m8FdCtIU93 (14/15) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ditlevbrodersen/status/1434161455830601729))
	- Thus well equipped, I hope everyone will now go out and help maintain scientific sanity in department logos, course and lab web pages, so we don't spread any misinformation. You have to keep your communication officers in a tight rope! (15/15) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ditlevbrodersen/status/1434161491960373250))
