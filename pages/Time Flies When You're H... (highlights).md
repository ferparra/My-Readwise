	  🗨️ Articulate the strategy
	  ✅ Act on the strategy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KaraSkrip/status/1471660812804653059))

	- Ok yeah, that's cool and all, but how can you *actually* come up with a winning strategy? Of course @lennysan makes it simple:
	  1⃣ Identify the kernel (the core bet to drive your strategy)
	  2⃣ Break the problem down into levers that move you forward
	  3⃣ Work backward from the ideal ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KaraSkrip/status/1471663328699191301))
	- Bonus pro-tip to communicating your strategy: come up with a metaphor or make it visual so your audience can easily relate.
	  Also, learn from Barbara Minto. She's an absolute LEGEND when it comes to communication. 🔼🔼🔼🔼

	- And finally, here are the biggest things to take away from the PM Fundamentals course:
	  🦸‍♀️ Empower yourself
	  🔍 Focus on your strengths + patch your liabilities
	  📈 Your output = your team's output
	  💪 YOU'VE GOT THIS

	- On a personal note, thank you @lennysan SO MUCH for letting me be a coach on this journey. Everyone says it, but it's true, I wish I had this course when I was starting out! Even 10+ years into my PM journey I've learned so much from you and the students. You're the best!! 🔥♥️🙌 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KaraSkrip/status/1471666808738304003))
