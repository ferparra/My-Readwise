	- 1. Take Literature Notes
	  
	  In an index card or a digital page (Apple Notes or Notion or whatever) jot down information you don't want to forget or thing you'll use later in your own writing or thinking. Write in your words. Concisely. Not more than 3 sentences. No copy and paste. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/karthi2209/status/1388379624929890304))
	- 2. Take Reference Notes
	  
	  Mention the course of the note. It could be the name of the book with author name or research paper or link to youtube video or blog link or your own thought. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/karthi2209/status/1388379625676492800))
	- 3. Make notes permanent
	  
	  Look at all the notes of the day and arrange them in logical order based on learning, projects, circles, interests, thinking or research. Add value to existing ideas, arguments, discussions. Creating that web of knowledge note by note is the objective. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/karthi2209/status/1388379626460876804))

This creates more cues to trigger the right memory ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/karthi2209/status/1388379627190689792))

	- Who doesn't want to get better and efficient in learning and publishing? I was shy to keep all the notes to myself. Gearing up guts to share a nugget at a time with you all going forward. Learn in public zindabad ðŸŽ‰ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/karthi2209/status/1388379633255649284))
