	- A few things about a "true" PM:
	- Work at a small company.
	  
	  Work at a large company.
	  
	  Work for yourself.
	  
	  If you do all three over the years, you’ll gain skills, outlook and experience to do well in either situation. You’ll also figure out which approach works best for you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1402852307323260929))
	- The one very imporant thing I learned while working at JP Morgan was that every few months you should ask yourself:
	- @lennysan Oh actually here is *my* template I used for years.
	  
	  You can be sure everyone will have it slightly different*
	  
	  *save for the EMs who just saved it, to use it for next time :)

	- An interesting observation across the tech job market:
	  
	  The rise of the "top tier, remote-first, equal pay" companies.
	  
	  These are ones that pay ~$140-170K/yr base for sr engineers, ~$160-240K/yr for staff, plus equity.
	  
	  They are hiring away from FANG... in places like EU & India. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1517452900007567362))
	- Software engineering teams usually take twice as long to get something done as estimated.
	  
	  This is my observation, in general.
	  
	  It’s also the observation 50 years ago, as written in The Mythical Man Month.
	  
	  Incredible how this seems to have remained constant over decades:

	- Every time I post a #diagram about how big tech works - with a [[PRD]]/ERD process -, someone outside big tech shows up and assumes This Looks Like [[Waterfall]] Thus This Is Bad.
	  
	  Buddy.
	  
	  These places ship multiple times per day, and are more nimble than their competition using [[Scrum]].

	- Performance reviews are coming up. 
	  
	  An objective way to summarize your own achievements is to use numbers. Those numbers are facts, hard to argue with, and can be compared, should anyone want to do so.
	  
	  Some ideas for numbers. What else have you seen used in perf reviews?
