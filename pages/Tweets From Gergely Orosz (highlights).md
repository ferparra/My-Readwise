	- A few things about a "true" PM:
	- Work at a small company.
	  
	  Work at a large company.
	  
	  Work for yourself.

	  They are hiring away from FANG... in places like EU & India. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1517452900007567362))
	- Software engineering teams usually take twice as long to get something done as estimated.
	  
	  This is my observation, in general.
	  
	  It’s also the observation 50 years ago, as written in The Mythical Man Month.
