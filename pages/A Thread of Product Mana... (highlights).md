	- A thread of [[product management]] frameworks:
	  
	  (this might be useful if you are a product manager, product leader, or founder) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1399042778613485578))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Before we jump in:
	  
	  Frameworks will not fix all your problems.
	  
	  Used right, they should help you
	  1) better understand your context
	  2) create structure for problems
	  3) communicate ideas & solutions
	  
	  I often use these frameworks in my product work, sometimes without realizing it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1399042779787894786))
	- 1/
	  3X framework (Kent Beck)
	  
	  A product can be in one of 3 stages
	  1. Explore
	  2. Expand
	  3. Extract
	  
	  For product leaders this is the most vital framework to understand because almost every important decision should account for the stage your product is in.

	- Examples of decisions you can make more rigorously with the 3X framework:
	- 2/
	  5Qs for product rigor
	  
	  1) Who is the customer?
	  2) What is the problem/opportunity?
	  3) What is the main customer benefit?
	  4) How do you know customers want this?
	  5) What is the customer experience?
	  
	  This framework provides useful structure for product proposals, reviews, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1399042783743070212))

	  Product metrics categories

	  4. Satisfaction metrics
	  5. Ecosystem metrics

	  Themes for product planning
	  
	  Think through your allocation across a subset of these themes:
	  
	  1) Differentiators
	  2) Tablestakes
	  3) Incrementals
	  4) Embarrassments (or “Broken Windows”)
	  5) Customer Specials (or “Large Customer Requests”)
	  6) Tech Foundation
	  7) Speculative Bets ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1399042794908389379))

	  ICE prioritization (Sean Ellis)
	  
	  Evaluate candidate features across expected Impact, Confidence, Ease.
	  
	  I use it as a *heuristic* when prioritizing between a handful of fungible features, *not* as a formula for prioritized rank ordering.

	  Obvious, Easy, Possible (Jason Fried)
	  
	  A practical way to think & talk about tension in interface design. In your UI, what features must be obvious, what features should be easy to find, and what features should be possible to discover?

	  Customer Problems Stack Rank
	  
	  A B2B/SaaS product framework to elicit what problems truly matter for your customers. It isn't enough that your product solves a problem for the customer. You need to understand where that problem ranks.

	  the product vs. The Product
	  
	  "the lowercase-p product" is the pixels you're directly working on.
	  
	  But that’s not necessarily "The uppercase-p Product".
	  
	  The Product is The Main Thing that makes or breaks the user value prop.
	  
	  Sometimes the product & The Product are different. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1399042802210676741))

	  Porter's 3 Generic Strategies
	  
	  For B2B/SaaS products, be intentional about which of Porter's 3 generic strategies you are picking
	  
	  1. Broad differentiation
	  2. Overall cost leadership
	  3. Segment focus
	  
	  Avoid getting "stuck in the middle".

	  Stages of strategy maturity
	  
	  1: We don't need a strategy
	  
	  2: We need a strategy but don't have one
	  
	  3: We have a strategy but it isn’t articulated
	  
	  4: We have an articulated strategy but execution is disconnected
	  
	  5: We are cohesively executing on a known & rigorous strategy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1399048843270901760))

	  Jobs To Be Done (Christensen et al)
	  
	  To innovate, you need to understand what jobs your customers are hiring your product for. Look beyond the obvious utility of your product. I like how JTBD emphasizes customer psychology & creative execution.

	  Basic criteria for product comms
	  
	  When communicating about your product (e.g. on your website, blog post, pdf case study, product video), make it easy for customers to get an answer these questions
	  
	  1) What does it do?
	  2) Is it for me?
	  3) How good is it?
	  4) Should I act now? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1399048846295003137))

	  Team diagnosis framework
	  
	  Are we defining the product right?
	  
	  Are we defining right, but not building it fast?
	  
	  Are we defining right, building fast, but not at desired quality?
	  
	  Are we defining right, building fast, at desired quality, but not with expected business impact? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1399048847645499397))

	  The 3 levels of product work
	  
	  1. The Execution level
	  
	  2. The Impact level
	  
	  3. The Optics level
	  
	  Very important, esp. for product leaders to be intentional about the level at which they (and others) need to operate in a given context.

	  Inputs-Outputs-Outcomes
	  
	  [[Product management]] is about collecting the right Inputs, converting them to the right Outputs, so we can get to the right Outcomes.
	  
	  Like the 3X framework, this framework can help product people make better, context sensitive observations & decisions.

	- Take the perennial question of how to evaluate a Product Manager's impact.
	  
	  The vast majority (easily >90%) of companies don't have a good answer to this question.
	  
	  Here's how you might use the Inputs-Outputs-Outcomes framework to answer this question:

	  Basic B2B Product Strategy Framework
	  
	  Your B2B product strategy must rigorously answer these 3 questions:
	  
	  1) What customer segments are we targeting?
	  
	  2) What differentiation will we create for them?
	  
	  3) How will we reach these customers?

	  Agreed Target Quality Framework (h/t Jeff Seibert)
	  
	  Very effective for proactively & rigorously addressing Eng/Design/PM conflict when building a product.
	  
	  Instead of litigating 100s of details just before launch, discuss upfront the quality level you are aiming for (and why)

	  Delegation Framework (h/t Keith Rabois)
	  
	  This framework is especially useful for senior product managers & leaders to create clarity on the decisions team members can make on their own and the decisions you’d like to make with them.

	  LNO Effectiveness Framework
	  
	  This framework improved the quality of my life as a PM & my work more than anything else I've encountered.
	  
	  The main insight is that all your tasks are not created equal. There are 3 types of PM tasks:
	  
	  1) Leverage
	  2) Neutral
	  3) Overhead 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2p1oiDVIAE6-i1.jpg)

	- Before taking on a task, identify what type of task it is. Take more time than you would for Leverage tasks, and create the time to do that by taking less time for Neutral & Overhead tasks.
	  
	  (especially impt for senior PMs & leaders)

	  The 10-30-50 PM
	  
	  To make a major impact with your products, accelerate your career, get the opportunity to lead other PMs & create tremendous career optionality, aim to become a 10-30-50 PM: top 10% in one of the senses, top 30% in another one, and top 50% in the third.

	  Scope/Impact matrix for PM career growth
	  
	  At any point in your PM career, you’re managing a certain amount of product scope and you have a specific degree of unique impact.
	  
	  And you grow by alternately increasing your impact and your scope.

	  The SMART framework for PM feedback

	  Activities–to improve product/team
	  
	  Results–expected Outputs+Outcomes
