	- OKRs vs KPIs
	  
	  Really the difference is often how you want to define them because really they’re just labels.
	  
	  But how I like to use them are:
	  
	  KPIs = baseline health
	  OKRs = things we want to change

	- OKRs are the things we’ve chosen to ‘change’ (either be improve, reduce, achieve, etc)
	  
	  KPIs are the indicators that we monitor to ensure that things are running smoothly.
	  
	  You need both.

	- In my training I use the analogy of flying a plane.
	  
	  Imagine you’re a pilot coming in to land and your OKR is to decrease your altitude by 100m per second.
	  
	  Now imagine that metric is the only dial you have on the dash.
	  
	  You’re watching it tell you you’ve hit your OKR

	- Now imagine you have a 2nd dial (KPI) on the dash that says you just lost an engine. Now you have a problem!
	  
	  You can think of all the other dials on the dash which you’re not directly influencing but are still important to maintain like pitch, speed, altitude, etc. as your KPIs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ant_murphy/status/1638646824671248384))
