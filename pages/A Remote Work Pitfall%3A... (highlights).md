	- A remote work pitfall:
	  
	  Meetings become less costly
	   -No friction to join
	   -Multi-task at your desk!
	  
	  👇🏼
	  
	  More people in more meetings
	   -Lots of listeners trying to multi-task
	  
	  👇🏼
	  
	  Nothing happens except meetings
	   -Flow-based “deep” work dies ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wintonARK/status/1412809013708804101))

	- Unpacking this problem even further:
	  
	  If something is multi-taskable...
	  
	  …it should be automatable.
	  
	  Not only do meetings impair the ability to get into flow, they also bias people against automating routine workflows. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wintonARK/status/1412811608162652160))
	- The problem:
	  Good meetings can be really good
	  
	  Multiple minds approaching a challenge from orthogonal perspectives yield better, more creative, and more robust solutions.
	  
	  AND
	  
	  Hard and deep and flow-based work (writing, coding, modeling, design) is how you win.
