	- Got a big, meaty problem that seems overwhelming and that everyone on the team has a different opinion about? 
	  
	  The absolute best tactic I know to make progress: set the timer for 2 hours, create your best strawman proposal, and share it with the team.
	  
	  Why? Thread ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joulee/status/1440343321004503046))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- If your proposal is >70% on the right track, the comments you'll get are minor suggestions for improvement. 
	  
	  Fantastic, you've already done the hard work of getting alignment on the general shape of the solution. 
	  
	  Go you! Now the next steps of iteration are much easier.

	- If your proposal is <70% on the right track, you'll get a lot of strong responses disagreeing with your general approach or assumptions. 
	  
	  Awesome! Now ask those people for *their* alternative proposal, or to remix yours.

	- No matter what, you'll have achieved a few things:
	  
	  1) Gone from 'judging' to 'creating,' thereby learning more
	  2) Gotten real reactions vs. abstract thoughts
	  3) Either found or eliminated promising paths
	  4) Inspired others to share their ideas
	  5) Created a sense of momentum

	- Sounds foolproof, right? Why don't we suggest strawman proposals all the time?
	  
	  Because that voice in our head says...
	  
	  1) Don't waste others' time with your half-baked idea
	  2) Don't risk looking like an idiot 
	  3) There's gotta be someone more qualified than you to take the lead ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joulee/status/1440343326041927682))
	- One way to address this voice is to load up your strawman proposal with caveats. 
	  
	  Examples:
	  "Putting out a rough sketch to get the conversation going..."
	  "I'm sure all of you have way better ideas than this..."
	  "I'm not happy with this proposal, so I'd love your help..."

	- Tell people the reason you are putting forth your strawman proposal, even if you think it sucks: because you're banking on the strength of the team to help push solutions forward. 
	  
	  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single first step.

	- The alternative to proposing your strawman is staying silent, waiting for someone else to take the lead and solve the problem instead of seeing this as an opportunity to climb the ladder of ownership. 
	  
	  Fin.
