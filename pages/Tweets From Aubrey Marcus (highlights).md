	- The moment you base your confidence on your function, rather than your essence, you are lost in a nightmare of anxiety.  
	  
	  Functions can be replaced. No matter what you ‚Äúdo‚Äù someone can ‚Äúdo‚Äù it better.  
	  
	  Except be you. So let your confidence rest in your essence, not function. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1164607217670283265))
	- When the world is afraid, [[courage]] can be as simple as a smile.
	  
	  Complimenting a stranger.
	  Helping out a friend.
	  Making someone laugh.
	  Being there for family.
	  Dropping old grievances.
	  Meditating instead of medicating.
	  
	  And doing the same thing, even when it‚Äôs normal again ü§ç ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1238999691301457921))
	- We chase the ones who run away from us or reject us, because they confirm a belief we have about ourselves.
	  
	  That we are not worthy of love.
	  
	  The desire to attain their love is a quest for redemption. If they love us we can redeem our love for ourselves. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1196174598137696263))
	- Everything is super important. Until you are sick. Then you realize there was only ever one thing that was important.
	  
	  Your health.
	  
	  But nonetheless we borrow from the bank of our health, taking loans on stress and sleepless nights to pay for something that doesn‚Äôt really matter. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1163143301731667970))
	- When we are no longer able to change a situation - we are challenged to change ourselves.
	  
	  -Viktor E. Frankl ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1104879895379955712))
	- The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails.
	  
	  -William Arthur Ward ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1102675232735879168))
	- Not expressing the truth is an act of manipulation.
	  
	  It is bending reality for your own selfish gain. 
	  
	  What if we were just honest? With ourselves and with each other?
	  
	  The consequence of losing money or losing a relationship from being honest is far less than losing yourself. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1215949310640164864))
	- You are enough.
	  
	  And you can do better!
	  
	  Both are true, simultaneously.  It‚Äôs a lie that you can‚Äôt love yourself where you are and still be motivated to achieve more.
	  
	  Love is the best engine to power us.  Not only to accomplish for ourselves, but for the good of all. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1169643234567630848))
	- When a bone breaks and aligns incorrectly in your body, a doctor often times has to re-break the bone in order for you to heal.
	  
	  The same is true for the ego.
	  
	  Trauma or the conditioning of the world can cause our own mind to align incorrectly.
	  
	  Healing may require a breaking. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1189278593802801160))
	- Until you have fasted, you‚Äôll never know how little you need.
	  
	  Until you have feasted, you‚Äôll never know what is too much.
	  
	  But both will cause your demise unless you find a balance between the extremes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1193764278551093248))
	- Sometimes you find yourself playing a game where the only way to win is to stop playing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1194509512931196929))
	- Sometimes the best thing you can do is STOP üõë
	  
	  Do nothing.
	  
	  Wait for the emotional storms to clear.
	  
	  Wait for your awareness to sharpen.
	  
	  Otherwise your action is taken in folly, because it is made in distress and impatience, rather than clarity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1208486581419405312))
	- ‚ÄúYou are allowed to be both a masterpiece and a work in progress, simultaneously.‚Äù 
	  
	  -Sophia Bush ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1102947301461504002))
	- Most of us should stop asking advice. 
	  
	  Because you know what you should do.
	  
	  Even if it isn‚Äôt clear, you know the next step.
	  
	  So why don‚Äôt you just do it?
	  
	  Whatever fear is holding you back, isn‚Äôt nearly as scary as living your whole life never knowing what is possible for you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1168726313609453568))

	- Don‚Äôt trust what you think.
	  
	  Your mind is a minefield of conditioning and bias.
	  
	  Don‚Äôt trust what everyone else thinks either.
	  
	  Be curious.  Be skeptical.  Be rational.  Observe.  Quiet the mind and listen for your knowing.  Truth often comes as a whisper, not a shout. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1172376790544740352))
	- Before you get sick your body will whisper about its fatigue.
	  
	  Before you break up, your lover will whisper her requests.
	  
	  Before your business goes bankrupt, your customers will whisper their complaints.
	  
	  If you don‚Äôt listen to the whispers, you‚Äôll be forced to hear the screams ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1164570582308069376))
	- ‚ÄúThe best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.‚Äù 
	  -Ernest Hemingway ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1108443350808567811))
	- Instead of seeking validation through your job, relationship, or appearance focus on LIVING. Fully embodied. Free of the insatiable ego and the time traveling mind. 
	  
	  As Boyd Varty says, ‚ÄúInstead of trying to ‚Äúbe something‚Äù, find something so engaging you forget yourself.‚Äù ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1228896840206209024))
	- ‚ÄúBetter a cruel truth than a comfortable delusion.‚Äù 
	  -Edward Abbey ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1108005235258204160))
	- We either make ourselves miserable, or we make ourselves strong. The amount of work is the same. - Carlos Castaneda ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1161729243832823808))
	- There is only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and that's your own self.
	  
	  -Aldous Huxley ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1099821671891062785))
	- ‚ÄúCharacter, like a photograph, develops in darkness.‚Äù 
	  
	  -Yousuf Karash ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1103060669547663360))
	- Fight hard.  Especially when it‚Äôs hard.
	  
	  Love hard.  Especially when it‚Äôs hard.
	  
	  Forgive hard.  Especially when it‚Äôs hard.
	  
	  Work hard.  Especially when it‚Äôs hard.
	  
	  Speak hard truths.  Especially when it‚Äôs hard.
	  
	  Do that, and watch how much easier your life becomes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1184888872913620992))
	- ‚ÄúThe most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. The fears are paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do. You can act to change and control your life; and the procedure, the process is its own reward.‚Äù
	  
	  -Amelia Earhart ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1102600261258960896))
	- Think back to a year ago.  Remember what was bothering you? Is it still bothering you?
	  
	  How about a month ago?  How about a week ago?
	  
	  Whatever you are going through will pass. And in hindsight you‚Äôll be grateful for what it taught you.
	  
	  So why not use hindsight as foresight? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1228027686964137984))
	- We want things.
	  
	  But we don‚Äôt want to pay the price.
	  
	  In fact we always want the things that we aren‚Äôt willing to pay the price to attain.
	  
	  We want to just want, not get.
	  
	  Because the price isn‚Äôt money. The things we really want require genuine sacrifice. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1182116850093772805))
	- You are only truly loved when you love yourself.
	  
	  You are only truly forgiven when you forgive yourself. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1204089216076005382))
	- Don‚Äôt make a New Year‚Äôs resolution that you aren‚Äôt going to keep.
	  
	  Every time you make a promise to yourself and break it, you condition yourself to break your commitments.
	  
	  You trust yourself less.
	  
	  Better to make a small commitment and stick to it, than a grand one and fail. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1211752714381643776))
	- Loneliness is not cured by human company. Loneliness is cured by contact with reality. - Anthony de Mello ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1122923533632405505))

	- The future is a thief.
	  
	  It robs you of the [[present moment]], leaving you with your hopes and fears.
	  
	  Hope tells you that what is happening right now isn‚Äôt as good as it could be.
	  
	  [[Fear]] tells you not to be too happy now, because it could all be taken from you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1187398531394527232))
	- The hardest person to tell the truth to is yourself.
	  
	  We judge our imperfections.
	  We deny our shadow.
	  We are scared of change.
	  
	  So as long as we live in a world of projection, denial, and rationalization, we can stay safe and cozy in our own delusion.
	  
	  Or... [[courage]]. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1162855975210115072))
	- If you want to give up,
	  Don‚Äôt.
	  
	  If you think the world is against you,
	  It‚Äôs not.
	  
	  If you think that it‚Äôs not worth it,
	  It is.
	  
	  Just keep going. Never stop.
	  
	  Because you never know when paradise is around the next dark corner. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1247745065566396421))
	- The idea that you should only Love someone to the extent they Love you back is the greatest lie.
	  
	  To Love is it‚Äôs own gift.  It requires nothing in return.  It costs nothing.  Or it‚Äôs not Love.  
	  
	  Without placing expectations, you have the freedom to be in Love your whole life ‚ô•Ô∏è ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1161319354526359552))
	- Remember: the actions of one person are not representative of the whole.
	  
	  If someone is ungrateful, all people are not ungrateful.
	  
	  If someone manipulates you, all people are not conniving.
	  
	  If someone doesn‚Äôt love you, other people WILL love you.
	  
	  See the truth beyond your pain. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1195366518760058880))
	- There is no good that comes from an expectation.
	  
	  Only suffering, and the diminishment of joy.
	  
	  We suffer when an expectation has not been fulfilled. And even if it is met, you have denied yourself the full pleasure of awe, surprise, and appreciation... because it was expected. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1167089767848271874))
	- Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.
	  
	  -Robert Louis Stevenson ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1105468496014704640))
	- Words are like little spells. Put them in the right order, with the right incantation, and they can do many things, for both good and bad. 
	  
	  Ironic that they call the formation of letters into words ‚Äòspelling‚Äô üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AubreyMarcus/status/1201035582832553984))
