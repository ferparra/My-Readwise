- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Jan 8th, 2023]]
	- This weekend I built a Notion QA Bot: ask questions of your @NotionHQ database and receive an accurate, conversational response back
	  
	  Much more user friendly than the traditional search experience (see thread)
	  
	  Built with @LangChainAI, open sourced here: https://t.co/J8slxDOnWZ https://t.co/5NzR6hTHtQ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hwchase17/status/1592547529568444416))

	- One example where the search experience was better was with the "work from home policy" question. If you search this in Notion the regular way you get "No results", but it is in fact there 
	  
	  fun fact: I actually first thought the bot was hallucinating b/c it was so hard to find

	- Another example of where the search experience was better: handles typos (eg "vacatiton policy") better

	- Finally, it can synthesize a lot of information well! Look how many results there are for "lunch"

	- This example implementation uses Blendle's Employee Handbook (found online in the Notion Examples) but the code is compatible with any Notion export.
	  
	  The core logic for this was already in @LangChainAI - check it out if interested in more applications! https://t.co/vxBzH0v5F9 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hwchase17/status/1592547546907693057))
