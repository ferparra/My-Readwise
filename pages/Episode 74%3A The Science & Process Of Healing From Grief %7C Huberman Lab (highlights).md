	- In many ways, grief is like a phantom limb – after amputation, you will feel like your limb is still there when it’s gone ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22cv7n5tjbv40n67wwygqz))
	- All relationships are mapped through the brain and body through three dimensions: (1) space; (2) time; (3) closeness (emotional) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22d7m9ej7kbkr50e9t7rgz))
	- To get through grief, we have to remap our attachment– grief is the process of uncoupling and reordering our relationship from space, time, and closeness (e.g., not expecting to see them at a certain place or time) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22defdv0nnjb65y4bydpmv))
	- Grief is more than sadness; it’s a state of yearning and desire for something that is just outside your reach until you remap your relationship with that person or thing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22dm3frtr1ck2ng7wh33kq))
	- Surprisingly, we should consider grief as a motivational state – it’s a desire for something (and not actually a desire to have the person back) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22dv3cg8t013xc40ejc3gf))
	- **Five stages of grief (non-linear & not everyone makes their way through all stages):** (1) denial; (2) anger; (3) bargaining; (4) depression; (5) acceptance
	  
	  •   Denial: refusal to accept a new reality that a person or animal is gone
	  •   Anger: recognition that a person or animal is gone; the body goes into motivated state
	  •   Bargaining: refusing to accept reality & wondering what you should’ve/could’ve done
	  •   Depression: “why should I go on living?”
	  •   Acceptance: cognitively and emotionally accepting life will continue ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22e2btcrp066dbdza6bt6a))
	- **Once someone is gone, we’re put into an action state of looking for and seeking that person, expecting them to contact us or see them when we’d expect** – this *is* grief ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22ef7f8j0b7knmr0tr396w))
	- People with higher baseline levels of anxiety (not depression) tend to experience complicated grief and prolonged grief symptoms ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22esa3x0mh2jt2fazsnzcb))
	- **Cortisol levels of a typical person or someone experiencing non-complicated grieving:** high cortisol upon waking, reduction in cortisol by 4 pm, further reduction by 9 pm ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22f0tc2wanyf59k8p9wmjh))
	- **Cortisol levels of someone experiencing complicated or prolonged grieving:** high cortisol upon waking, and still high cortisol levels at 4 pm and 9 pm ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22f7cwfetmjmn4xrn4e2sj))
	- **Set aside dedicated time (5-30 min) to feel the feelings with the following guidelines:**
	  
	  •   **Avoid “counterfactual thinking”** – AKA the “what ifs” – what if I called more? What if they took a different path home? Etc. This is an extension of guilt that strengthens bonds and makes grief more difficult
	  •   **Feel the connection but stay connected to current space and time instead of anchoring in memories**
	  •   Understand that you are likely to float through various states but try to come back around
	  •   **Place notions of where that person is now** – of course, this varies based on your personal beliefs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22fscp7m3c2f7tk8fkb4wj))
	- **Allowing yourself to embrace the attachment allows up to work through the grief but we must pull the other levers of dimension – space & time** – and work on adjusting our expectations of seeing the person when we expect ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22g86f6dra7r70yw48m8p2))
