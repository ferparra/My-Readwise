	- Had a great chat with @TylerHakes about what good remote work actually looks like.
	  
	  He runs a damn good content agency-slash-collective called @YesOptimist and shared mistakes & unique ideas for productive remote work.
	  
	  Here are 4 things we talked aboutðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pantherhr/status/1433446731224649729))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- #1 Let people do what theyâ€™re good at.
	  
	  When you hire someoneâ€“â€“letâ€™s say a writerâ€“â€“youâ€™re paying them to do what theyâ€™re good at: To write. 
	  
	  If youâ€™re having them spend their days in Zoom calls, youâ€™re wasting their talents.
	  
	  Use this framework to eliminate more meetings. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pantherhr/status/1433446732763967493))
	- #2 Be asynchronous
	  
	  Why? Because async communication creates better communication.
	  
	  When you know somebody wonâ€™t reply right away, you think for longer about how to write a message.
	  
	  This makes your team more efficient overall. 
	  
	  It also means you can work across time zones. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pantherhr/status/1433446734517129227))
	- #3 Be in-person at least 1% of the time.
	  
	  Pre-pandemic, YesOptimist would have regular team retreats. They're good for:
	  
	  + Teambuilding
	  + Brainstorming things that are hard to talk about remotely
	  
	  And, get damn good at running efficient Zoom meetings when you do need them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pantherhr/status/1433446736043905029))
	- #4 Set expectations immediately to reduce stress.
	  
	  Notification overload is a thing with remote work, and Tyler makes sure new team members know whatâ€™s important and whatâ€™s not.
	  
	  Sometimes, itâ€™s as basic as showing someone how to turn off notifications in Slack or Asana. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pantherhr/status/1433446737818132496))
	- Weâ€™ve weaved some of these insights into a playbook weâ€™re writing on remote work ðŸ“—
	  
	  Follow us for more thread like these.
	  
	  And, thanks to Tyler for the chat. His agency, YesOptimist, is badass and a great example of good remote work policy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pantherhr/status/1433446739772682240))
