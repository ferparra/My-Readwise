	- By staking your coins, you are earning anywhere from 4 to 15% annually on your holdings. But, where is the money coming from? Of course, the money is coming from the only place it can come from: from other people who are not staking their coins.

	- Staking rewards are created through inflation. If everyone holding a given crypto-asset is staking all their coins, then everyone gets (out of thin air) a new amount of coins each period exactly proportional to their existing ownership
	- So, clearly, if you’re going to hold one of these coins, you need to be a staker, otherwise you are going to be diluted continually by others who do stake. So, if we follow this to its inevitable conclusion, the long term stable equilibrium is that almost everyone will stake.
	- But, if everyone stakes, then there is no return to be provided by the non-stakers, there is just inflation, which does not provide a real return. Of course there may always be a few irrational actors who choose not to stake. But in general, the staking yield should be thought of more as the penalty rate for non-stakers than as the reward rate for stakers. So, this means as a holder of PoS coins, you are in a position of needing to do work and/or put coins at risk, but you don’t really get paid for it. But, let’s say we accept that burden just as the cost of holding PIE since it’s such an awesome coin. Well, actually, it’s much worse than that.
