	- The Power of Acceptance
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Successful people accept what is in front of them, and work with it., * The chimp brain is more likely to be unsuccessful, because it spends its time getting aggravated instead than accepting and moving straight into plan of action.)

	  My first step is acceptance. And that is what winners do. Successful people go, you know, it doesn't mean acceptance were all over. It means let me start from what's in front of me and stop fighting it and then work with it and then see what I can do with it. Whereas when you look at the chimp brain, which generally is not as successful can be, what it does is it says, I don't want what's in front of me. I want it different. This is not what should happen. So it spends its time getting aggravated rather than accepting and moving straight into plan of action. So we often spend a lot of time had you say it about what's happened or what's in front of us instead of saying it's happened.

	- How to be happy
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Because we are constantly interacting with technology, it is important to be aware of the ways that technology can interfere with our ability to be ourselves., * It is important to define ourselves before we start presenting to the world, as the chimp system or computer system, as these are the only options available to us.)

	  Because if we were, we can't surgically remove interference neuroscientifically, which we can see on functional and mariscaners. If we remove the chimp and computer system, then you're completely in control of yourself. So you would choose to become. You would choose to be confident. So therefore that's you. The human system can choose. What happens is when you choose to become the chimp system interferes or the computer interferes and throws shows to the world someone who's not calm. So it's very important to recognize who you are before we start. So now we've got a guy. You're not going to write. No one ever writes anxious. No one. They say, you know, what I want to be is calm, collected, a good friend, have integrity. That is you if we didn't have interference in the machine. So it's very crucial. This is the biggest point in the book. The biggest point is to define yourself because now you've got self esteem can rise just on that alone. Once you've grasped that, you say, wow, when I'm presenting to the world is interference. It's not me. If I didn't have this machine, I would not have anxiety because that's the system that you say in the human system can't do anxiety. It's not built to do that. It's built to be rational and calm. But what it wants to do and how wants to present is a choice. The chimp has no choice. The computer has no choice. The computer's programmed. But these are interfering and presenting to the world, someone who's not you. So it's very important to grasp that concept. That's my starting point. Now we've grasped that. We build on that.
