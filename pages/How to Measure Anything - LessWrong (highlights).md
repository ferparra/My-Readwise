	- Anything can be measured. If a thing can be observed in any way at all, it lends itself to some type of measurement method. No matter how “fuzzy” the measurement is, it’s still a measurement if it tells you more than you knew before. And those very things most likely to be seen as immeasurable are, virtually always, solved by relatively simple measurement methods.
	- A measurement is an observation that quantitatively reduces uncertainty. Measurements might not yield precise, certain judgments, but they do reduce your uncertainty.
	- Uncertainty is the lack of certainty: the true outcome/state/value is not known.
	- Risk is a state of uncertainty in which some of the possibilities involve a loss.

	- Your problem is not as unique as you think.
	  You have more data than you think.
	  You need less data than you think.
	  An adequate amount of new data is more accessible than you think.

	- Define a decision problem and the relevant variables. (Start with the decision you need to make, then figure out which variables would make your decision easier if you had better estimates of their values.)
	  Determine what you know. (Quantify your uncertainty about those variables in terms of ranges and probabilities.)
	  Pick a variable, and compute the value of additional information for that variable. (Repeat until you find a variable with reasonably high information value. If no remaining variables have enough information value to justify the cost of measuring them, skip to step 5.)
	  Apply the relevant measurement instrument(s) to the high-information-value variable. (Then go back to step 3.)
	  Make a decision and act on it. (When you’ve done as much uncertainty reduction as is economically justified, it’s time to act!)
	- When measuring risk, we don’t just want to know the “average” risk or benefit. We want to know the probability of a huge loss, the probability of a small loss, the probability of a huge savings, and so on. That’s what Monte Carlo can tell us.
	- Information can have three kinds of value:
	  
	  Information can affect people’s behavior (e.g. common knowledge of germs affects sanitation behavior).
	  Information can have its own market value (e.g. you can sell a book with useful information).
	  Information can reduce uncertainty about important decisions. (This is what we’re focusing on here.)
	- In a business case, the economic value of measuring a variable is usually inversely proportional to how much measurement attention it usually gets.
	- Decomposition: Which parts of the thing are we uncertain about?
	  Secondary research: How has the thing (or its parts) been measured by others?
	  Observation: How do the identified observables lend themselves to measurement?
	  Measure just enough: How much do we need to measure it?
	  Consider the error: How might our observations be misleading?

	- Does it leave a trail?
	- Can you observe it directly?
	- Can you create a way to observe it indirectly?
	- Can the thing be forced to occur under new conditions which allow you to observe it more easily?
	- a very small sample can often offer large reductions in uncertainty
	- Potentially slow convergence: Software project cost overruns, factory downtime due to an accident.
	- make use of the Rule of FIve: “There is a 93.75% chance that the median of a population is between the smallest and largest values in any random sample of five from that population.”
	- Value of information analysis: Using Excel macros, the AIE analyst runs a value of information analysis on every variable in the model.
	- Preliminary measurement method designs: Focusing on the few variables with highest information value, the AIE analyst chooses measurement methods that should reduce uncertainty.
	- Measurement methods: Decomposition, random sampling, Bayesian inversion, controlled experiments, and other methods are used (as appropriate) to reduce the uncertainty of the high-VoI variables.

	- You can compute the value of additional information by knowing the “threshold” of the measurement where it begins to make a difference compared to your existing uncertainty.
	- Knowing just a few methods for random sampling, controlled experiments, or even merely improving on the judgments of experts can lead to a significant reduction in uncertainty.
