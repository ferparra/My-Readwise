	- Is it Fair Question Around Rigorous?
	  
	  Summary:
	  When people get more senior overtime, they have this tendency to ask the one question that the anal ster colleague is just not prepared for. And it's usually their blind spot. Now, if you ask the question enough time, they become anticipatory of the broader view. So i think that's a great way to put it. Our president, david bronson started working for him when i was 22. A b c g, he used to do tat all the time to me, and now i see myself doing it to people.

	  Is it fair question around rigor to wonder, for the person covering the security, whatever it is, the company, whatever it is you're lik investing in, that you couldn't stump them on important aspects, like, what's going on here with a business?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I think that's right. And you always see that when people get more senior overtime, they have this tendency to ask the one question that the anal ster colleague is just not prepared for. Our president, david bronson. Ha started working for him when i was 22. A b c g, he used to do tat all the time to me, and now i see myself doing it to people. And closing that gap is almost part of the rigor example, which is everyone who starts as an analyst or a different colleague can get the base line answer it has to be, but to get the insight, which is really delivers differentiated investment returns, is much harder. And it's usually their blind spot. Now, if you ask the question enough time, they become anticipatory of the broader view. So i think that's a great way to put it.
