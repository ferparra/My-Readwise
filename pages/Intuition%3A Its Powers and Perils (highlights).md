document_note:: This text discusses the powers and perils of intuition and how it can be used to better our lives. It explores different aspects of intuition such as the dual attitude system, emotion perception, empathic accuracy, nonconscious learning, and creativity. It also looks at the limitations of intuition such as misreading our own minds, belief perseverance, illusory correlation, and hindsight bias. It emphasizes the importance of being mindful of the limits of our self-knowledge, thinking critically, and checking our intuitions against reality.

		- **Note**: Intuition is a form of knowledge that is experienced directly, is often driven by emotions, and is acquired through past experience. It is a type of perception that is immediate and effortless, unlike deliberate thinking which is slow, rational, critical, and analytic and requires conscious appraisal and justification with logic and evidence.
	- We know more than we know we know. The autonomic nervous system responds with measurable perspiration and sped up pulse when a loved one's face is shown, the body displays recognition although we may not react. What the conscious mind cannot understand, the heart knows ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gskz2cggv60t53apmn9pmyn8))
		- **Note**: Our body can recognize people we love even if we don't know that we recognize them. We may not be able to explain why we feel a certain way, but our bodies know more than we think. When we see a loved one's face, our body will respond with changes like sweat, a faster heartbeat, and a feeling of recognition even if we don't remember why we recognize them.
	- •   Nonconscious learning - what you know, but don't know you know, affects you more than you know
	  •   Learned expertise - experts' knowledge is more organized than novices'
	  •   Tacit knowledge - street smarts, practical intelligence, knows how (rather than knows that, explicit knowledge/expert) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gskz3jehsq4pdfefsg1tddzr))
		- **Note**: The text discusses three concepts related to intuition: nonconscious learning, learned expertise, and tacit knowledge. Nonconscious learning refers to knowledge that a person has but is not aware of, which can have a strong influence on their behavior. Learned expertise is a type of knowledge that is more organized in experts than in novices. Finally, tacit knowledge is a type of practical intelligence, which is different from explicit knowledge and expertise.
	- Heuristics - perceptual or mental cues that usually work well but occasionally trigger illusions or misperceptions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gskz4cqva8ethcbs5vap2n20))
		- **Note**: Heuristics are mental and perceptual cues that we use to guide our decisions and actions. They usually work well and help us make efficient decisions. However, they can sometimes lead to illusions or misperceptions.
	- Mispredicting our own feelings / behavior / hindsight bias / self-serving bias / overconfidence- Humans are often bad at predicting our own future behavior - look to a person's past for better accuracy. Beware illusory, blind spots, complacency. Humility/Realism. So, despite our impressive capacity for thinking without awareness, for social intuitions, and for intuitive expertise and creativity, our intuitions sometimes mislead us as to what we have experienced, how we have changed, what has influenced us, and what we will feel and do. There are three things extremely hard: steel, a diamond, and to know one's self. Asking people to explain their past actions or to guess their future actions sometimes gives us wrong answers. By being mindful of the limits on our self-knowledge, we can restrain our gullibility and motivate ourselves to think critically, to check our own and others' intuition against reality, and to replace illusion with understanding.

		- **Note**: Humans often make mistakes when they try to guess how they will feel or behave in the future. This is because of something called hindsight bias, self-serving bias, and overconfidence. No matter how good we are at using our intuition, we can still be wrong about what has happened, how we have changed, and what has influenced us. It can be very hard to understand ourselves and our own behavior. If we ask people to explain their past actions or guess their future actions, we may get wrong answers. To avoid being fooled, it is important to be aware of our limitations and to think carefully about our own and others' intuitions. We should try to compare them to reality and find a better understanding.
	- Hot hands / streaks not as random as you think - expect them to happen ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gskz62yyczbdtcz9k5yhvf3j))
	- Loss aversion, endowment effect, sunk cost, anchoring, overconfidence (greatest for most unpredictable events), diversification, sustainability (surviving is the number one goal) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gskz671y6dfn0wfct74vytwz))
	- Must monitor the predictive powers of your intuition. Beware the tendency to see associations you expect to see. Recognize the seductiveness of hindsight, which can lead you to feel overconfident (but sometimes also to judge yourself too harshly for not having foreseen and averted catastrophes). Recognize that theories, once formed, tend to persevere even if groundless. Guard against the tendency to ask questions that assume your ideas are correct; consider the ideas and test them, too. Better yet, harness the underappreciated power of statistical prediction. Actuarial science strengthens clinical judgment, or at least offers a second opinion. Actuarial science also helps protect practitioners from malpractice suits, which might otherwise allege that the clinician made aberrant decisions without attending to relevant research ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gskz6cbpc8mszftbfwmqda65))
		- **Note**: The passage is saying that it is important to be careful with how we use our intuition. We should not assume that we are right just because we think something is true. We should also be aware that sometimes we can think that something happened in the past when it didn't really happen. We should also make sure to ask questions that don't assume we are right. We should use statistics to help us make predictions. Statistics can help us make better decisions and protect us from people accusing us of making bad decisions.

	- Interviews aren't great predictors. Someone's past track record is their best predictor.
