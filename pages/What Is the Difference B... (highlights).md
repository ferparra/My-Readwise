	- What is the difference between an API and a Microservice?

	- As you may know, API (Application Programming Interface) is a communication channel between client and server that allows two applications to talk to each other. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1522237200821280768))
	- Microservices are a part of the microservice architecture, an architectural style that focuses on maintaining several independent services that work collectively to create an application. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1522237204885643267))
	- So what's the difference?
	  
	  Each individual service within a Microservice uses internal APIs to communicate with each other, which is why the difference between them is sometimes confused. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1522237208987643906))
	- An API is only the individual piece of software used for communication, so it is often a necessary part of any application structure. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1522237213102202880))
	- Microservices enable robust and flexible application design and break down app functions into modular programs.
	  
	  If one service is compromised, it will affect only that service and not the entire application. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1522237217145597953))
	- On the other hand, if an API is compromised, it can break the application and expose data, leaving it at risk to attackers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1522237221239234560))
	- Microservices can differ widely in their purpose, but the underlying structure is the same: 
	  
	  Breaking down an app into its service components to increase autonomy and efficiency.
	  
	  APIs tie everything together within the Microservice. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1522237225253146630))
	- It's important to note that not all apps that use internal APIs are Microservices.
	  
	  Apps can still make use of internal APIs without following the microservice architecture. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rapid_API/status/1522237229401317378))
