	- •   9 Rules for Success
	    1.  Having the Willingness to Pay talk with customers early in the product development cycle
	    2.  Don’t force a one-size-fits-all solution (segment!)
	    3.  Product configuration and bundling is more science than art
	    4.  Choose the right pricing and revenue models, because how you charge is often more important than what you charge
	    5.  Develop your pricing strategy – create a plan that looks a few steps ahead, allowing you to maximize gains in the short and long term. It must have clear intent, quantifiable goals, and a time frame for execution
	        1.  Goals – market share, total profit, profit margin, customer lifetime value…
	        2.  Right type of pricing strategy – maximization, penetration, skimming
	        3.  Price-Setting Principles – monetization model, price differentiation, price floors, price endings, price increases
	        4.  Develop principles for reaction – promotional, competitive,
	    6.  Draft your business case using customer willingness to pay data and establish links between price, value, volume, and cost.
	    7.  Communicate the value of your offering clearly and compellingly. They don’t buy products, they buy the benefits that the products offer (don’t communicate features – a feature belongs to the product; a benefit belongs to the customer)
	        1.  Develop crystal clear benefit statements (not feature descriptions)
	        2.  Make your benefit statements segment-specific
	        3.  Measure the impact and refine your value messages
	    8.  Understand your customers’ irrational / emotional sides in making purchasing decisions
	        1.  Compromise effect (comparing)
	        2.  Anchoring tactics (sets the context for value)
	        3.  Using price to signal quality
	        4.  Razor / Razor blades
	        5.  Pennies a day pricing
	        6.  Psychological price thresholds
	    9.  Maintain your pricing integrity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1cb03zeeqt2vdb4ww4ymy6))
		- **Note**: Monetizing Innovation outlines 9 rules for success in product development, including talking with customers early in the product cycle, segmenting solutions, choosing the right pricing and revenue models, developing a pricing strategy with clear goals and a time frame, drafting a business case, communicating value clearly and compellingly, understanding customer irrationality in making purchasing decisions, and maintaining pricing integrity.
	- Willingness to Pay
	  
	  1.  See if you have the opportunity to monetize or not – overall WTP and then how much value customers place on each feature and what they’d be willing to pay for that value. What do you think could be an acceptable price? What do you think would be an expensive price? What do you think would be prohibitively expensive price? Would you buy this product at $XYZ? Follow each of these questions with “why?”
	  2.  Help prioritize features and design the product with the right set of features
	  3.  Help avoid the 4 types of failure ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1caaj64f2tks56gx2rb2ym))
		- **Note**: Monetizing Innovation involves assessing the customer's willingness to pay for a product or feature, in order to prioritize the design and help avoid potential failure. Questions like "What do you think could be an acceptable price?", "What do you think would be an expensive price?", and "Would you buy this product at $XYZ?" should be asked, with the responses followed up with "why?". This helps to ensure that the product is designed with the right set of features and avoids potential failure.
