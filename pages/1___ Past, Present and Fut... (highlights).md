	- 3/ 📃 Arbitrum is an Optimistic Rollup solution that supports the same byte code as 🔷 #Ethereum, so that #ETH devs could easily cross-compile their contracts for running on Arbitrum. 
	  
	  🌐 This ensures full compatibility with ETH on the smart contract and #Web3 interface levels. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/1inch/status/1440693252110241794))
	- 4/ 📝 Arbitrum's major advantages are: 
	  
	  ✅ Much lower costs of transactions
	  
	  ✅ Fast confirmations, giving a near-instant user experience ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/1inch/status/1440693253951557636))
	- 5/ 🦾 Depositing funds via Arbitrum is seamless via its native bridge, but the protocol enforces a withdrawal delay when withdrawing funds to Ethereum to allow for the state to be fully confirmed. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/1inch/status/1440693255683796995))
	- 6/ 🧑‍💻 Nevertheless, several providers have already launched fast bridging solutions to close this gap and give users a fast and cost-effective browser into and out of Arbitrum One. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/1inch/status/1440693257835454464))
