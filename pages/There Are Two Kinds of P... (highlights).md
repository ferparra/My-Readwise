	- There are two kinds of problems: strong-link problems and weak-link problems.
	  
	  Weak-link: quality depends on how good the *worst* things are
	  
	  Strong-link: quality depends on how good the *best* things are

	- Figuring out which kind of problem you're facing is really important, because the way you solve them is totally different.

	- Here's the thing: ***science is a strong link problem***
	  
	  How do you know? Well, we don't believe in little sperm-boys anymore

	- And yet most people treat science like it's a *weak-link* problem. Universal pre-publication peer review, grant committees, scattershot replication attempts––these are great solutions for a weak-link problem, but terrible solutions for a strong-link problem ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/a_m_mastroianni/status/1645851502404161548))
	- As a result of a generation of weak-link thinking, we've got many entries into my least-favorite genre of all time: "Nobel Prize winner explains how they could not do their Nobel Prize-winning work today."

	- It can be really hard to recognize a strong-link problem, because it requires you to see bad stuff and go "whatever!" It's so tempting to try to stamp out everything bad, not realizing that you're also preventing good stuff from coming into existence.

	- Science isn't the only problem we've probably misdiagnosed. We're doing this all the time.
