	- I'll start writing some 2022 predictions in this thread, will see what I come up with before the year end üëá 
	  
	  Will be interesting to see next year what I was most wrong about ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476068950584791041))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1. Optimistic rollups will take off, but ZK rollups won't really. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476069383227293698))
	- 2. Layer 2 tokens will surpass $50bn in total market cap. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476069590891483139))
	- 3. Ethereum (ETH) won't flip bitcoin (BTC). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476069772785819649))
	- 4. But no Ethereum killer (SOL, AVAX, LUNA, ADA etc.) will flip ETH either. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476070086008098819))
	- 6. DeFi will continue to not happen on Bitcoin. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476070410433318914))
	- 7. LN adoption will be underwhelming. We won't surpass 6000 BTC in public LN channels. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476070788684029953))
	- 8. Stablecoins won't migrate back to BTC. USDT adoption on LN won't get traction. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476071141504598017))
	- 9. Polygon's ZK rollup tech acquisitions won't go anywhere. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476071328402878467))
	- 10. People will find new exciting use cases for NFTs. It turns out, jpegs was just the first iteration. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476071539388866562))
	- 11. There will be a lot more thots in crypto. Related to the above. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476071839789166594))
	- 12. For Ethereum-based rollups, it will look like they will solve fees & congestion in the beginning, but before the year has come to an end signs of problematic clogging will be visible again. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476073021236555779))
	- 13. "Data availability (DA)" will be the big theme for 2022. Chains that specialize in it will get traction. Some rollups will choose to bridge to Ethereum, but use other solutions as the DA layer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476073134142939141))
	- 14. The Rainbow model for bitcoin will stay intact.
	  
	  (And I mean actually stay intact, not stay intact because I make up new numbers). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476073537966325764))
	- 15. We will have the technology ready for low-fee payments in highly private dollar synthetics with some amount of decentralization and censorship resistance to them. But they won't yet become very commonplace in darknet markets in 2022. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476074189740294145))
	- 16. Yes, the Merge will happen and it will be successful. There may be some resistance from PoW miners, but any remaining PoW-chainsplit of Ethereum will swiftly fall into irrelevance. No catastrophic attacks on ETH2 PoS occur. https://t.co/sQYh5DOfyd ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476075137032151041))
	- 17. There will be no new Bitcoin softfork upgrade in 2022. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476079489008427010))
	- 18. There will be new signs of institutional bitcoin adoption. A very large pension fund investment or something along those lines--something that kickstarts the MicroStrategy narrative again which mostly fizzled out in 2021. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476080167957282823))
	- 19. OHM fails. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476090256395018245))
	- 20. I would like to say ‚Äù2022 is the year of the Coordicide‚Äù but probably better to not get your hopes up. 30% chance it happens near the end of the year, more likely 2023. https://t.co/mtHJFq1g7n ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476113446634676228))
	- 21. $AVAX will join the top 10. $ADA will drop out of it. https://t.co/JBqqmZQs5s ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476115826898092036))
	- 22. Richard Heart forks BSC. It will have a $100 billion market cap but be placed at spot #202 on CoinMarketCap. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476117963535228930))
	- 23. DeFi won‚Äôt happen there. And outside of DeFi, EVM/SC platforms have no real use case. https://t.co/4ACGmatfNe ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476119226607931403))
	- 24. $ATOM (#30) overtakes Litecoin $LTC (#19) https://t.co/TdVjEzZrlg ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476120551404015621))
	- 25. NEAR is great but nothing will happen on it https://t.co/1pQy7cqTqy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476120855197405193))
	- 26. This will never happen again https://t.co/RYxBSAO0Ie ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1476121072957378562))
