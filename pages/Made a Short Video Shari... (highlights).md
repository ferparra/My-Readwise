	- Made a short video sharing how I use Threading mode with the breadcrumbs plugin in @obsdmd - https://t.co/T12m8dnYJV Kinda awkward but I'm no video maker. https://t.co/3ePvgPFUwm ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/syncretizm/status/1477268460673462273))

	- Threading mode is seriously magical. It's truly non-local, because you don't need to start from a parent bullet and go down in hierarchy. You can start from a child and go up to a parent. You can start from a thought and go to what leads up to it. Frees thought so much. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/syncretizm/status/1477483267519500289))

	- https://t.co/aPCXARqWVf Metaphor to threading mode and what it feels like ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/syncretizm/status/1477530584788336640))
	- I can't explain how liberating threading mode is to my mind. It feels like home, and it's fun. Here's a screenshot of what I've been delving into...

	- One thing I've started to notice was that I was starting to close loops - literally. Threads have started to form interconnected circles and I love it.
