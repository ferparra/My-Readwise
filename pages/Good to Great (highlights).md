document_note:: Good to Great by Jim Collins is a book that examines the shared characteristics of great companies, and what sets them apart from good ones. It identifies seven key aspects of successfully transitioning from good to great, including Level 5 Leadership, First Who, Then What, Confronting Brutal Facts, Lead with Questions, Engage in Dialogue and Debate, Conduct Autopsies, and Hedgehog Concept. It also discusses the importance of culture, technology, and time in the process, as well as several key findings including the lack of correlation between larger-than-life CEOs and going from good to great, the importance of understanding what not to do, and the necessity of core values.
