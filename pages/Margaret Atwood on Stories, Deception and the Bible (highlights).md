	- The Power of Storytelling
	  
	  Summary:
	  i think we're more likely to be sucked into doing stuff by people manipulating our good side. We didn't develop math until pretty late in our human history, whereas we developed language and music very, very early. So stories come naturally to small kids. They understand that there's a plot and that there are actors in the plot, like their teddy bear. But if they're just numbers, not so much. I watch a lot of sesime street these days. I an y pec. I can relate. Yes.

	  I mean, i were i worry my bank high skills are week. Si, might hav tactial objections to the plan.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Supposing it was a fool proof plan, you might do it then, but only if it were for the greater good. So i think we're more likely to be sucked into doing stuff by people manipulating our good side than by people appealing to or our greed and and power hungriness. Although there are enough of us who are interested in the greed and power hungriness. So its a motif.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I buy the thought that our good side is more potent to manipulate than other parts of us. But the other thing i think you're getting at there, that always feels true to me, is that part of the power of a story is gree to which it makes us a person, simply of consequence that we are, ye see ourselves as the actor, living at a moment in human history where we matter. We're not just one of the many.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, stories, by their very nature, have central characters, unless their history, stories dealing just with statistics. But we know that we're much more likely to be able to remem ra story that is about a person or people, not one that is just about numbers, unless we make the numbers themselves into actors in the story. I'm going to tell you a story about the number nine, a very heroic number.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I watch a lot of sesime street these days. I an y pec.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I can relate. Yes. So you make the numbers into sort of entities, and and then we can be interested in them. But if they're just numbers, not so much. We didn't develop math until pretty late in our human history, whereas we developed language and music very, very early. So stories come naturally to small kids. Yo, you know this yourself. So this happens, then this happens, and then this happens. They understand that there's a plot and that there are actors in the plot, like their teddy bear. So it's really built in. And i think what kids do before the age of two is pretty indicative of what comes with the tool kit. They already are doing little dances. They have a sense of rhythm. They're very interested in music, and they're very interested in words and facial expressions. But they're not interested in nine times nine at that age.
