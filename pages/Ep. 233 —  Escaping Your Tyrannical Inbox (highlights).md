	  It's not really that important. I'm just, you know, internet, internet, phone, tick, talk, tick, talk, and then they do a synchronized dance and put on their oculus goggles and ironically watch cartoons. I don't know what Generation Z does, Jesse. A synchronized dance. Is that what you do on the tick talk? I think so. According to the tick talk, like most people. I know what tick talk about through you. Then you know nothing about tick talk. Whatever. Coming from the guy who wrote a whole New Yorker piece on tick talk. Something about dancing. The kids are dancing and I don't know, they're all hopped up on marijuana. When I was young, we had to kill. This is true. We had to kill a German soldier on our walk to school up the uphill every day. And there was a war going on. Anyways, point being, call me. Some percentage of the things go away. The things that remain are now dispatched much more effectively. I know it's a pain when that phone rings. You're like, oh, I have to answer this. But honestly, if you answer that and in two minutes, you figure something out, you've saved yourself maybe five to 10 emails each requiring five to 10 email checks. The overall amount of stress is much less. And so anyways, I work with some people. I have at least one person in mind who uses this all the time and I appreciate it.
