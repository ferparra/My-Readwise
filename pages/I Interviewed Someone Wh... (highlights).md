	- I interviewed someone who told Steve Jobs he was wrong and got promoted.
	  
	  She then built early smartphone companies worth billions.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- Be 100% focused on the person you're with.
	  
	  • Don't think about what is next
	  • Don't think about what you just did
	  
	  Just listen intently and magic happens. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1397010421408845829))
	- Make a personal balance sheet of strengths and weaknesses
	  
	  • What am I good at? 
	  • What do I enjoy doing?
	  • What are my weaknesses?
	  
	  Those are the answers for what to do in your career. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1397010422239203330))
	- Sell your ideas
	  
	  In a company it’s not enough to just be right. 
	  
	  • Get data
	  • Build an argument
	  • Find key supporters ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1397010423023652869))
	- You're always optimizing for something. 
	  
	  • Do you want money?
	  • Do you want impact? 
	  • Do you want freedom?
	  
	  Once you realize that, you can be intentional about it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1397010423694700544))
	- Lesson on impact from Steve Jobs:
	  
	  A job is more than earning a paycheck.
	  
	  You can actually have impact in the the world.
	  
	  “Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can influence it."
	- Common advice: Fire people fast in your startup
	  
	  But if every 3 months you have a new executive...
	  
	  Look in the mirror: Am I the problem? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1397010425447858182))
	- Push decision-making down the organization.
	  
	  A failed business is one where the CEO makes every decision.
	  
	  When the VP of Marketing disagrees with the VP of Manufacturing, force them to figure it out 99% of the time.
	  
	  This avoids future bottlenecks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1397010426257367052))
	- A CEO has 2 jobs:
	  
	  • Set vision + direction
	  • Get the right people and give them enough resources ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1397010427150753793))
