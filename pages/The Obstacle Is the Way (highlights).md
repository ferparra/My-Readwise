	  •   Knew as he was approaching the ground from his parachute that he would be captured and tortured but did not contemplate further. He (and [John McCain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain) who was there at the same time) cared about his cause and his men's well-being above his own
	  •   In every situation, no matter how dire it may seem, try to find the bigger picture and how your actions might be able to help others, loved ones
	  •   Pride can be broken. Toughness has its limits. But a desire to help? No ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4r8pr5kp8jz4gzndxstpzm))
		- **Note**: James Stockdale knew that when he jumped out of his plane with a parachute, he would get caught and hurt. But he didn't think about that. He and John McCain cared more about the cause they believed in and the well-being of their friends than about themselves. No matter how hard something seems, always try to think about how it could help other people, even if it means being brave and putting your pride aside.
