document_note:: Bill Walsh was an influential leader and coach who believed that if you do the right things, the score will take care of itself. He was extremely demanding but quiet about it, and was known for his technical knowledge and attention to detail. He was also incredibly respectful and taught his team members to reach their full potential. He created a process called the "Standard of Performance" which focused on planning, precision, and poise. He believed that failure was an integral part of success and that one of the most important things for a leader to do is to treat people right. He also believed in being open to serendipitous moments and chance happenings, and encouraged his staff to network and delegate. He believed that the most important characteristics of a great leader were functional intelligence, talent, character, and the ability to work with others.
