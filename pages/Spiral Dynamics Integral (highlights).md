document_note:: Spiral Dynamics Integral is a theory developed by Don Beck that explains how and why people change and the common patterns in that evolution. It involves the concept of expressed and sacrificed self, and explores the task of evolving from perversity to decency. The theory is based on the emergent, cyclical, double helix model of adult, bio psychosocial systems development. Clare Graves is seen as the Godfather of the theory. This theory is organized by different tiers and colors; the tiers range from Beige, which is the most basic level, to Turquoise, which is the most advanced. This theory is used to understand how and why people think and value what they do, as well as how to create structures and pathways for people to progress.

	- Emergent, cyclical, double helix model, adult, bio psychosocial systems development
	  
	  1.  Emergent arises
	  2.  Cyclical - 2 poles with I/me/mine and we/us/ours at opposite ends
	  3.  Double helix - awakened systems in people and organizations to handle emerging conditions
	  4.  Adults ready to explore and evolve
	  5.  Bio psychosocial - chemical components in the brain that make people ready for this ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt0bd78bxtjj4yds3vyfh27w))
		- **Note**: Spiral Dynamics Integral is an emergent, cyclical, double helix model that is used for adult, bio psychosocial systems development. It consists of two poles at opposite ends, I/me/mine and we/us/ours, and involves an awakened system in people and organizations that helps them to handle emerging conditions. This model also takes into account the chemical components in the brain that make people ready to explore and evolve.
	- Basic value systems / priorities for living. How and why we think and see the world. Simply how and why people think and value what they do
	  
	  1.  Beige - first tier, colors or levels are used to abstract other human traits. Beige is the most base level and once these needs are met, it leads to coordination for safety and security
	  2.  Purple - tribalistic and animistic and cause / effect. Sharing, superstition, coordination for safety and security
	  3.  Red - I/me/mine and a self of sense, ego centric, want it all and want it now, want to be free, rebel
	  4.  Blue - a search for a meaning in life, justify your existence, we/us/our, purpose driven, one right way, order and discipline and responsibility, transcendence and sacrifice for something bigger, law, Justice and fairness. Leads to countries and religions
	  5.  Orange - seek to find universal truths, science, fate control to the understand that every individual can act on their own and make their world and others worlds better, secular and autonomous, Individualism, success driven. The major world color today
	  6.  Green - a new sense of humanness, authenticity, internal worlds of feeling and chemicals and internal exploration, human rights, consensus, life’s continued quest of meaning, egalitarianism, release talents of every human
	  7.  Yellow - There is a quantum jump from green to the next tier. A lack of fear, different priorities, integrated, authentic, natural, balanced. This is yellow. Yellow doesn’t like being praised because it knows when it has failed and when it has succeeded. Equanimity, comfortable in a variety of environments, non-judgmental, sees the world as dynamic and organic and not static, upfront and non BS, both/and and not either/or, integral - meaning they can mesh together differences
	  8.  Turquoise - competency, utility, things that work, whole earth, mystical ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt0bcrx9peda2m7e4r5vt371))
		- **Note**: Spiral Dynamics Integral is an abstract system for understanding basic value systems and priorities for living. It identifies eight tiers or levels of values, from Beige (the most base level, focused on safety and security) to Turquoise (focused on competency, utility, things that work, and the whole earth). In between are Purple (tribalistic and animistic), Red (ego-centric), Blue (purpose-driven and focused on order and discipline), Orange (seeking universal truths and individualism), and Green (focused on human rights and consensus). The last tier, Yellow, is a quantum jump from Green and is focused on equanimity, non-judgmentalness, and the ability to integrate different perspectives.
