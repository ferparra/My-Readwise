	- During the last few weeks there has been a lot of discussion around the possibility of miners running custom software that accepts bribes to reorg the chain.
	  
	  @gakonst and I explain how this will become harder after the proof of stake merge:

	- @el33th4xor People are harder to tightly coordinate in small groups than I expected. You can't just get everyone to sit around in a circle, see each other's inherent goodness and get along, especially when huge incentive conflicts are at play.

	- @santisiri PoH is already doing that! The challenge is that there need to be "sinks" for the UBI token, and not just issuance. Ultimately it boils down to the same problem as public goods funding: we need to move beyond individual donations and get to persistent commitment by *mechanisms*.

	- IMO the #1 user experience need for crypto continues to be secure key management solutions. Multisig, scorched earth vaults, uPort-style social account recovery, hardware wallets, all good, but lots of work UI side (and formally verifying the actual contracts!) left to be done ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/940466614960398336))
	- My argument for why the future will be *multi-chain*, but it will not be *cross-chain*: there are fundamental limits to the security of bridges that hop across multiple "zones of sovereignty". From https://t.co/3g1GUvuA3A:

	- My new socials page:
	  
	  https://t.co/gtgCSP52rA
	  
	  I'm eagerly trying out Mastodon, Farcaster, Lens and others, and I'll bow to Lord Elon and pay his $8/month too... but only when it's available on a non-iOS platform.
	  
	  Let the best socials win! *
	  
	  * there will be multiple winners

	- @tylercowen My theory is different: the AI-driven commoditization of articulateness in elite registers of the English language is going to degrade its value, and by extension further degrade the social status of those who depend on it as a status marker.
