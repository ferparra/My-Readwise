	- In some advanced areas in the theory of differential equations, one is interested in finding "weak solutions" where a weaker sense of differentiability is used than the one ordinarily used #calculus. Here's an example (with a challenge). #math #algebra

	- Two topological #Christmas presents for you. (The first one isn't hard, but the second a bit challenging.) Have a superweekend! #math #topology #algebra

	- We can conceive of group representations as generalizing Fourier transforms. Indeed, for compact groups we have extensions of the classical Parseval and Plancherel formulas connecting functions and their Fourier transforms. Here are examples. #math #calculus #topology #algebra

	- There's been some commotion about pictorial "proofs" of "π = 4". Those same arguments can be used to show that "π = L" for arbitrarily large L, as shown here for the interval [0,1]. The problem: the derivatives of the curves are ignored in the approximations. #math #calculus

	- A commutator differential equation for your weekend. Have a super weekend!  (What if the commutator  [X,A]  is replaced by  [X, [X,A], can it be solved?)  #math  #algebra  #calculus  #differentialequations #ODE
