	- I've looked at hundreds of design portfolios while hiring for Maven.
	  
	  And honestly... the default format consistently falls short ðŸ˜¬
	  
	  So instead of creating another cookie-cutter portfolio piece...
	  
	  Try this instead ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Ridderingand/status/1471480240245411844))

	- "The first thing I notice in portfolios tends to be visual design and attention to detail"
	  
	  â€” @nlevin (Design Director, Figma)
	  
	  And yet too many portfolio pieces bury the lead...
	  
	  The secret is to think of your portfolio project as a recipe video ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Ridderingand/status/1471480241272934401))
	- Recipe videos don't start out by pouring flour into a bowl...
	  
	  Or by showing a wad of dough on a table ðŸ¤¦
	  
	  People have short attention spans. And the best creators know they have to suck you in immediately.
	  
	  So instead... https://t.co/rQyKm13Z40 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Ridderingand/status/1471480247279181827))
	- Recipe videos start by showing you this gorgeous shot of the finished dish!
	  
	   This is what draws people in...
	  
	  And only THEN do they show the steps taken to achieve the end result. https://t.co/gDPcwUKlkq ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Ridderingand/status/1471480251280605188))
	- Like someone scrolling Tik Tok, hiring managers have a short attention span.
	  
	  You can't expect them to be inspired by yet another board of sticky notes as the first thing they see in your portfolio piece. 
	  
	  Make me WANT to keep reading first. Then you can show off your process...

	- And as much as people hate to hear it...
	  
	  Anybody can cobble together a UX process by copying and pasting from the thousands of cookie-cutter Medium case studies.
	  
	  When I'm skimming (and you better believe I'm skimming)...they all look identical.
	  
	  3 things to focus on instead ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Ridderingand/status/1471480260277407747))
	- The way you separate yourself from the pack is by:
	  
	  â€¢ Showcasing your understanding of visual fundamentals (typography, layout, color, hierarchy)
	  
	  â€¢ Crafting a compelling narrative (recipe video)
	  
	  â€¢ Demonstrating an attention to detail (find tiny delight moments) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Ridderingand/status/1471480261330169858))
	- If you too want to rid the world of cookie-cutter portfolios... ðŸ˜‡

	- P.s. if you're working on a portflio piece now and want some inspiration for what goes into the "steps" of the recipe video...
	  
	  Here's a little something extra ðŸ‘‡
