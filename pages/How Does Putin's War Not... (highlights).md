	- If the plan is to stand up a quisling government in Kyiv, what's the next plan to get recognition of that government from anybody this side of Belarus?

	- How does Putin stop a flow of volunteers from Poland, the Baltic republics, etc entering Ukraine to fight - and maybe suffer as casualties, stiffening opinion against him in their home countries? 5/x ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/1496968884485824522))
	- Putin suppressed resistance in Syria by unrestricted air bombing - and by winking at the use of chemical weapons by his local ally against its own people. What does he think happens when he tries such methods a few hundred kilometers from the countries of western Europe? 6/x ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/1496969390209830914))
	- Right now, Russia has Europe at a huge disadvantage because of tight oil and gas markets. Those markets cannot be loosened fast, but they can be loosened in time.
