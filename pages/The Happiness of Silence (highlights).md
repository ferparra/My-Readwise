	- How Do We Measure Progress?
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Noises are most celebrated addiction these days,., * We often measure progress and productivity in terms of how much mental stuff we're creating,., * GDP is a measure of how much industrial stuff we're creating, but also how much sound and stimulus, data and content we're creating., * If you take our attention and you chop it up and turn it into eyeballs on a Facebook page that juices advertising revenue, then that increases GDP., * But if you keep our attention whole, if you keep our attention pristine in a moment of undisturbed play with our kids or admiring a beautiful piece of art in a museum or enjoying a walk in nature, that's not optimizing GDP.)

	  You made this strong claim that all of the world's problems are in part due to this noise. Well, we're living in a time when we often mistake feelings of stress for aliveness. We look in the book at how noises are most celebrated addiction these days, how we often measure progress and productivity in terms of how much mental stuff we're creating. We look in the book at how we measure GDP, for example, in terms of how much industrial stuff we're creating, but also how much sound and stimulus, how much data and content we're creating. If you take our attention and you chop it up and turn it into eyeballs on a Facebook page that juices advertising revenue, then that increases GDP. But if you keep our attention whole, if you keep our attention pristine in a moment of undisturbed play with our kids or admiring a beautiful piece of art in a museum or enjoying a walk in nature, that's not optimizing GDP. So we just thought about how bizarre it is that the way we measure progress as a society is this measure of GDP is this measure of maximum sound and stimulus maximizing optimizing increasing. So we just thought about how bizarre it is that the way we measure progress as a society is this measure of GDP is this measure of maximum sound and stimulus maximizing optimizing increasing the number of claims we're making on consciousness.

	- The Power of Silence
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Lee suggests that we can find silence in our activities by slowing them down and paying attention to them in a different way., * Justin and Lee find silence in their full, busy lives by not adding more to their todo list and simplifying their lives.)

	  Another thing you've talked about that we can do is that when we are engaged in activities, we can pay attention to those activities in a different way. We can kind of find silence in what we're doing. Lee, give me an example of how something like that might work. Yeah, I mean, maybe we look to a ritual that you have, for example, maybe making coffee in the morning is your ritual. If we could like slow that activity down by 10% bring that much more attention to it, then we can find the silence inside that. And really, that's not a lot of doing. It's not a lot to ask. It's a light lift, right? So if we can bring that attention in, we can find the silence inside there. We're so interested in not adding more to the to-do-is, but just kind of taking away, simplifying, slowing down, finding that space and silence. And Justin and I are finding that silence not by running off to retreats for six months at the time, but really like in a full, busy, pretty compressed, demanding life, silence is always with us.
