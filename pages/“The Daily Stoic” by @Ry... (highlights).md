	- 1) Know The Difference Between What You Can & Cannot Change 
	  
	  Trying to change or being upset about a situation you have no control over is a waste of time and energy. 
	  
	  Change what you can and accept what you can't. You will be much happier if you do. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlexAndBooks_/status/1367863684928856064))
	- 2) Be Careful of Growing Indulgences
	  
	  Every full-blown addiction starts as a small indulgence. 
	  
	  These little indulgences can chip away at our freedom and before we know it, turn into major addictions. 
	  
	  Reclaim your ability to abstain and regain your self-control. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlexAndBooks_/status/1367863686522540033))

	- 3) Review Your Day To Make Sure You're On The Right Path
	  
	  Seneca and Marcus Aurelius would sit down and journal at the end of each day to reflect on their day and life. 
	  
	  Seneca would ask himself: 
	  
	  What bad habit did I curb today? 
	  Were my actions just? 
	  How can I improve? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlexAndBooks_/status/1367863691211857924))
	- 4) It's Okay To Not Know Everything   
	  
	  In our always-on world, it's impossible to know everything. 
	  
	  That's why it's so important to be able to say "I don't know." 
	  
	  You don't need to have an opinion or be up to date on every single topic, and that's perfectly okay. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlexAndBooks_/status/1367863692663152642))
	- 5) Anger Isn't A Strength, It's A Weakness 
	  
	  Being angry clouds your judgment and makes it harder for you to act logically instead of emotionally.
	  
	  Strength, meanwhile, is the ability to maintain your emotions in hard situations rather than letting your emotions control you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlexAndBooks_/status/1367863694215049216))
	- 6) Stop Getting Upset About Things That Haven't Happened
	  
	  Getting upset about things that haven't happened is like continuing a bad dream while we're awake. 
	  
	  Wake up right now instead of living in a nightmare that doesn't exist. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlexAndBooks_/status/1367863696697999364))
