	- This is the best podcast I've listened this year.
	  
	  Annie Duke won over $4 million as a professional poker player and is an expert on decision-making.
	  
	  Together with William Green, they talk about:
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1. Be at ease with a bad outcome
	  
	  Think in probability and play to the best of your hand.
	  
	  Don't dwell on a bad outcome if the process and decision-making were sound.
	  
	  You have no control over outcomes when luck is involved.
	  
	  Embrace uncertainty.

	- 2. Advice from Eric Seidel, a 9-time world series of poker bracelet winner who made $40 million.
	  
	  Do not dwell on 'unlucky' events.
	  
	  By all means, discuss what could have been done better.
	  
	  If you played to the best of your cards, that's all that matters.

	- 3. We make all decisions based on probabilities.
	  
	  Consciously or subconsciously.
	  
	  Whether its choosing your partner or the route you are taking to work.
	  
	  You're making a forecast.
	  
	  The moment we make it explicit, we start to create feedback loops we can learn from.

	- 4. If we don't have an edge, don't play
	  
	  And we are very good at fooling ourselves into believing that we have an edge.
	  
	  Set up structures, write down your thesis.
	  
	  What new information will break your thesis? When should you quit?

	- 5. Know your limits and set rules around it
	  
	  For Annie, she played best in 6 to 8 hour sessions.
	  
	  Set out the rules beforehand rather than waiting until you are in it0
	  
	  Because you will not make good decisions then.

	- 6. Loss aversion
	  
	  Our loss aversion prevents us from selling investments at a loss.
	  
	  But this extend beyond investing to 
	  
	  Decisions should be made based on the future, not the past.

	- 7. You hate your job?
	  
	  Cognitive biases often prevents us from making the switch.
	  
	  If your current job has a 0% chance of making you happy and a new career has a 50% chance, what's holding you back?

	- 8. Endowment effect
	  
	  We value things we own, much more than things we don't own.
	  
	  Even though the opposite might be true.
	  
	  It could be stocks, bonds or our IDEAS.
	  
	  We wrap our identity in things and won't quit despite the warning signs.

	- 9. The kill criteria
	  
	  Think in advance the signals you might see in the future that means that it is time to quit.
	  
	  To continue holding this investment, what do you need to see in the next few quarters or years?
	  
	  Sticking to things too long denies us future opportunities.
