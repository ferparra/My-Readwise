	- Product, at its heart, is the shaping of the company’s future by synthesizing customer needs with business opportunity. Engineering manifests that vision and is constantly pushing forward the boundary of what’s possible. It’s the flow between these organizations that makes effective product development.
	- Building the wrong thing. The classic result when there isn’t joint conviction and joint critical thinking about a path. Valuable time and energy is wasted on something that ultimately doesn’t have much business impact.
	- Unreliable planning. There’s a lot to be said for better estimation to get more reliable, but ultimately many financial plans need to be based on a roadmap. When that roadmap diverges significantly from reality, there’s often a direct financial impact, and scrambling across teams to figure out where to find an immediately addressable opportunity.
	- Shadow plans. When Product and Engineering work together, there’s a unity of purpose. In misaligned organizations, you’ll often see dual plans for what engineering is going to do, and what product wants to build for their customers. In reality, you end up with some kind of in-between monstrosity that doesn’t benefit anybody.
	- One of the most important uses of one-to-one time is to pre-wire an upcoming decision: if something’s going to be contentious, you can get on the same page ahead of time and go into an important decision with one voice.
