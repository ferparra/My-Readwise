	- Unless you demonstrate to your subordinates that you are competent and trustworthy and have their best interests at heart, they won’t perceive your feedback as helpful, no matter how well you give it to them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca/status/1625189321866375168))
	- If you spot any signs of paralysis, lack of confidence, or other negative responses, make your feedback smaller, more specific, and in general, provide a small, clear, explicit first step for them to take that they feel they can take.

	- The more you reward efforts without results, the more your people will focus on efforting rather than achieving. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca/status/1625189329575489536))
	- Every time your actions demonstrate you are a fair, helpful, and effective manager, you build trust. And every time you waste your subordinates’ time, effort, or proactiveness, you break trust. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca/status/1625189332071112704))
	- Meetings are not inherently wasteful; it’s that their attendees are not good at meetings. It’s your job as a manager to teach your subordinates how to be effective participants in meetings. You must coach your people. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca/status/1625189334663184386))
	- Keep high standards for online meetings. They can and should be engaging and effective.
