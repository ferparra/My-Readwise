	- Balancing homegrown product managers with product managers from other companies
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* One way to balance homegrown product managers with product managers who come from other companies is to have leads for each pillar, and to actively look for people who are strong in each area., * The main strength of retool's product team is its balance of homegrown and product manager from other companies.)

	  Speaker 1
	  One way which I like to do that is I really like to balance product teams with homegrown product managers who really get the product. They've probably been in it. They're amazing culture carriers often. They really set the tone, but they may not have seen product management at other companies and they may not have some of the more conventional traditional product management skill sets. So I want to balance that with product managers who've come from other companies and have done it and can bring a little bit more of that product manager rigor even though they don't have that sort of the core and the retool case, the core retool product management vibe. So that's one example. I think there's others as well. Some PMs are incredible execution machines. Other PMs are amazing visionaries. You kind of want a little bit of all of them. And you want to also balance within all of your different pillars. So we have three different product pillars at retool and there's kind of leads for all those pillars. They're just the leads to sort of hire people who don't look like them so that we have balance everywhere.

	  I love that. Do you actively as you're hiring, like, hey, when you're strong in these areas, here's the person we need here. We want this specific super strategy mind person. Is that actually how you think about this?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah. Yeah. I do a little personal exercise for myself every six months where I sit, chart out the team that we have today and write down all the strengths that we have. ([TimeÂ 0:57:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9dbabe4e-b15a-41be-bd8c-155e6c4846f9))
