		- **Note**: Thread
	- For decades, the ‚Äúchemical imbalance‚Äù theory was common knowledge‚Äîblaming low serotonin levels for depression
	  
	  Of course Big pharma pushed this, as antidepressants (which are based on the chemical imbalance theory) represent a $10 billion dollar industry in the US alone ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146417462693889))
	- What if depression isn‚Äôt caused by a ‚Äúchemical imbalance‚Äù after all? What if depression is really just a symptom of an underlying problem?¬†
	  
	  Let‚Äôs get into it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146419001901060))
	- Although this ‚Äúchemical imbalance‚Äù theory has been pushed for decades, there are a few issues:
	  
	  -Only ¬º people with depression have low serotonin
	  -Some people with depression have high levels of serotonin
	  -Some people with no history of depression have low levels of serotonin ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146422365822976))
	- Doesn‚Äôt exactly add up, does it?
	  
	  Even though the science is unclear at best, antidepressant prescriptions have only increased: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146424102264835))
	- -Antidepressant prescriptions have increased 35% in the last 6 years
	  -Children under 17 years old who were prescribed antidepressants increased by 26%
	  -Children aged 5‚Äì12 years who were prescribed antidepressants has increased by more than 40% ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146425964498953))
	- You can find stats like these all day, but you get the point
	  
	  This is a scary thought; not only because of the poor science, but the life altering side effects and severe withdrawal symptoms that come with them, especially when children whose brains are still developing use them ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146433350598656))
	- Although we‚Äôve been misled for a long time, the good new is that the research has become more clear; showing that depression has a strong link to chronic inflammation ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146435112222721))
	- During an inflammatory reaction, the body produces a chemical called cytokines which have been shown to cause a variety of psychiatric symptoms
	  
	  Here are a few interesting studies: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146436840361990))

	- What‚Äôs interesting is that some SSRI‚Äôs have been shown to reduce those cytokines, which may explain why these drugs do work for some people ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146447636512771))
	- Unfortunately, today‚Äôs modern lifestyle is basically a breeding grounds for inflammation, which explains why both inflammatory illnesses and depression are so common these days.
	  
	  Some of the most common causes of inflammation are: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146449939087361))
	- Diet¬†
	  
	  The standard western diet filled with processed foods, oxidized vegetable oils and lack of vitamins and minerals has been associated with both inflammation and depression ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146451977605121))
	- Obesity¬†
	  
	  Obesity is a state of constant inflammation; linked with depression and higher levels of inflammatory cytokines ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146454271803393))
	- Environmental toxins
	  
	  Today‚Äôs environment is loaded with heavy metals, pesticides, plastics, and so much more. Chronic exposure to these toxins affect the immune system which in turn will increase levels of inflammation ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146456264151043))
	- Stress¬†
	  
	  Stress is an obvious cause of depression, but it is also linked with with high levels of inflammatory cytokines ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146458696896512))
	- Poor gut health
	  
	  The gut is the 2nd brain, and has a huge impact on our mental health.¬†It also majors a major role in the immune system which manages inflammation ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146461024616450))
	- Sleep deprivation¬†
	  
	  One of the absolute worst things for your overall health, increases inflammation and depression ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146463167930374))
	- Overall, it is clear that inflammation plays a major role in depression and other mental health issues
	  
	  Unfortunately today, it will take some major lifestyle and diet changes to really reduce inflammation, but it is one of the most important things you can do for overall health ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146465118355457))

	- Now, there are obviously circumstances in which people are going through major life events that cause depression, and understandably so
	  
	  I am not insinuating that 100% of depression cases are because of inflammation, but it is obvious there is a major link between the 2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1575146470231232515))
