	- The hardest thing to quit is who you are.
	  
	  What you do & what you believe can become part of your identity.
	  
	  Abandoning part of your identity is hard so when the facts conflict w/ your beliefs, the facts too often lose out.

	- But what if you believe the earth is flat?

	- If the facts conflict with a non-consensus belief, you are much more likely to stubbornly stick to the belief and rationalize away the facts. 5/8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnnieDuke/status/1579253074031697920))
	- @JohnBeshears @Katy_Milkman conducted a study of stock analysts and found that when they made earnings forecasts that were in the mainstream consensus, if actual earnings conflicted with their forecasts they updated their estimates. 6/8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnnieDuke/status/1579253075050606592))

	- What beliefs do you hold that define who you are?
	  
	  Whatever those beliefs are, beware. You will be more likely to reject the facts rather than update those beliefs, even when the evidence is clear. 8/8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnnieDuke/status/1579257644342480896))
