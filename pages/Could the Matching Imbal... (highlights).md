	- According to open source data, a man of average attractiveness can only expect to be liked by slightly less than 1% of females (0.87%) on Tinder. 
	  
	  This equates to 1 ‚Äúlike‚Äù for every 115 females.
	  
	  Men in the bottom 10% see just one match per week at most.

	- Ultimately, most women only swipe yes on a handful of men per day while men are more freewheeling with their swipes.
	  
	  This creates a highly competitive environment where many men find it difficult to get matches consistently.

	- The median female user receives about 2.75 matches per day while the median male user only receives about 1.1 matches.
	  
	  At that rate, to expect a match, a typical woman would have to like just three men while a man would need to like over 50 women.
