document_note:: This document examines the impact of energy on human civilization throughout history, from pre-agricultural foraging societies to modern societies powered by fossil fuels. It discusses the concept that energy is the only universal form of currency and explores how human bipedalism, the ability to make fire, and the domestication of plants and animals enabled humans to spread to different areas and adapt. It also looks at the three steps in the agricultural revolution and how energy use per person has become more efficient over time. Finally, it examines how the search for new and better energy sources has led to innovation, globalization, and the spread of wealth.
