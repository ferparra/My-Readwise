	- Audio features are descriptors of sound. When we are dealing with waveforms, we are dealing with time, and events happen across time. We can take a look at all the events across time by extracting features along the x-axis of a waveform. Amplitude envelope, Root-mean square energy and Zero crossing rate are some of the features we can extract.
	- A spectrogram is a visual way of representing the signal strength, or “loudness”, of a signal over time at various frequencies present in a particular waveform.
