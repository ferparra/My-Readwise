	- Mastery requires an ability to stick it out through loooong feedback loops
	- Freud has a great explanation for why the thrill of tight feedback loops never persists for that long: When any situation that is desired by the pleasure principle is prolonged it only produces a feeling of mild contentment. We are so made that we can derive intense enjoyment only from a contrast and very little from a state of things.
	- the pursuit of pleasurable sensory experiences leads inevitably to a state of dissatisfaction, because it is in the nature of pleasure not to be sustainable.
