	- Glenn Herbert Gould[fn 1] (/ɡuːld/; né Gold;[fn 2] 25 September 1932 – 4 October 1982) was a Canadian classical pianist. He was one of the best known and most celebrated pianists of the 20th century,[1][2] and was renowned as an interpreter of the keyboard works of Johann Sebastian Bach. Gould's playing was distinguished by a remarkable technical proficiency and a capacity to articulate the contrapuntal texture of Bach's music.
