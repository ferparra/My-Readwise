	- If you're a $LUNA holder, you need to understand how Anchor protocol $ANC works ASAP.
	  
	  There is a genuine need to address its sustainability.
	  
	  If you want to understand exactly how $ANC is paying savers today, to help solve the problem, keep reading.

	- Today, savers can deposit $UST in order to earn an attractive 20% APY, paid in $UST.
	  
	  This comes from three sources:
	  
	  1. "Real Yield" - staking rewards from deposited bETH and bLUNA.
	  2. Cost for borrowers to borrow (subsidised by $ANC)
	  3. TFL subsidised payments ("Yield reserve") ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DetectiveGrover/status/1502425383098097664))
	- Put simply:
	  
	  Anchor let's people borrow $UST against their deposited collateral. 
	  
	  This collateral has to yield bearing, like bLUNA or bETH. 
	  
	  They also have to pay an interest rate on their borrowed $UST.... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DetectiveGrover/status/1502425384561922050))
	- ...This is made attractive/palatable by $ANC token emissions, which offset their costs.
	  
	  The borrow interest rate is dynamic, and changes based on how much of the savers'  $UST is left in the earn pool. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DetectiveGrover/status/1502425386193403920))
	- Savers are currently paid ~20% APY, to facilitate mass $UST adoption. 
	  
	  This is currently only made possible by the yield reserve.
	  
	  Note - incentives are aligned as $UST adoption means burning $LUNA, and $LUNA top ups facilitate $UST adoption. 
	  
	  Let's look at the details. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DetectiveGrover/status/1502425387678248968))
	- 1 . Real Yield
	  This is dependent on:
	  
	  + Current Eth beacon chain staking yield - via Lido. Today this is 4.2% APY, after a staking rewards fee. This shouldn't decrease significantly.
	  
	  + Current bLuna yield. This is 7.11% APY today and has a floor of ~5.5%.

	- Based on the deposited collateral today, the Real Yield is 3.65% APY on the $UST deposited in Anchor Earn.
	  
	  More collateral is desperately needed to bump this number up.
	  
	  (Anchor V2 will allow new kinds of yield to be added, starting with staked Avax). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DetectiveGrover/status/1502425391549591553))
	- 2. Cost to borrow.
	  
	  Money isn't (normally) free. Borrowers pay an annual rate on the value of their $UST loans.
	  
	  To make this attractive, $ANC tokens are emitted to offset this cost.
	  
	  Right now, the loan is essentially free due to $ANC handouts (distribution APR):

	- Interest on borrowed $UST currently accounts for a roughly 3.35% APY.
	  
	  This is costing the protocol money in the form of $ANC tokens. 
	  
	  This borrow rate should remain competitive with other money markets, to encourage borrowers but not overpay them in $ANC. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DetectiveGrover/status/1502425396582756356))
	- 3. Yield reserve payments.
	  
	  This is what you've seen in the news - TFL topping up the coffers to allow 20% APY to be paid out.
	  
	  Right now, this accounts for ~13% APY paid to savers.
	  
	  This is only possible because of the incredible profits TFL and all $LUNA holders have made. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DetectiveGrover/status/1502425398210088960))
	- We can reason that $LUNA holders benefit from $UST adoption and vice versa. However this topping up of yield reserves does rely on trust.
	  
	  $ANC needs far more borrowers.
	  
	  They are the first class citizens of Anchor Protocol. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DetectiveGrover/status/1502425399602655234))
	- The main argument you'll hear is that if Anchor rates drop, users will sell their $UST and move elsewhere, killing the $UST peg.
	  
	  For this reason I've summarised the competition - sufficiently deep and "safe" stable pools.

	- (Alpha - there might be one more competitor entering the frame soon ‚ö°Ô∏è) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DetectiveGrover/status/1502425405537628160))
	- There are plenty of pools to choose from, however  how much confidence can you have in their stability? 
	  
	  The innovation Anchor brings is to use block rewards across blockchains, to derive DeFi‚Äôs benchmark rate. Paid in $UST.
	  This is how Anchor sets itself apart in the long term. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DetectiveGrover/status/1502425406917517314))
	- In the short to medium term, looking at the competition, I would suggest ~12% APY is going to maintain Anchor's position as king of DeFi savings accounts regardless. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DetectiveGrover/status/1502425408314163202))
	- Any solution we propose must achieve one or all of the following:
	- It also should not:
	- This hopefully serves as a primer to help understand what the hell is happening with Anchor Protocol governance at the moment.
