	- Avoidance acts as short-term mood repair. It works in the short term but not in the long term. We may escape the task and its associated negative emotions — like anxiety, frustration, resentment, or boredom — but the task doesn’t go away.
	- we rely on the present to predict how we’re going to feel in the future
	- When we process information about our present and future selves, the brain regions involved in processing information about our future self are the same as those used when we process information about a stranger.
	- Emotion-regulation skills include things like our ability to be aware of our emotions, label our emotions, tolerate and/or modify aversive emotions, and support ourselves through the experience of negative emotions.
	- Think about last week, and rate the following items from 0 (never) to 6 (always):A. I was clear about what emotions I was experiencing.B. I was aware of why I felt the way I felt.C. I accepted my emotions.D. I felt I could cope with my intense negative feelings.E. I was able to influence my negative feelings.Do you see the pattern in these items? Awareness, understanding, acceptance/tolerance, coping ability, and the ability to modify emotional experience are all emotion regulation skills.Although this is only a sample of items used in the research and not psychometrically valid, low scores on this scale indicate that your emotion regulation skills are lacking. Like any skill, however, these can be learned and enhanced.
