	- 1/ Just got off of a webinar we did with @Patticus and @guillaumecabane on how the crisis has affected SaaS businesses, and advice for what to do. 
	  
	  Some notes on what was discussed: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404824117657600))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 2/ 2008 was different.  The reason why this crisis is different, is that we can model better and faster than people can describe it.  We are seeing countries like China recovering a month or two in advance of us.  So this helps us forecast the predictability. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404825149464581))
	- 3/ McKinsey forecasts recovery from Q3 to Q4 on the economy standpoint. This will easily take until the end of the year to get back to normal levels. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404826059620359))
	- 4/ Stop acting as business is usual. Throw out the usual business prop.  There is going to be a new normal, if we are not already there. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404826923601927))
	- 5/ Humans have a hard time adapting that fast to a new normal.  A lot of people are hanging onto going back to old routines.  That world is gone.  In 6 months, will people rush to restaurants or still be scared? The faster you can adapt, the better you are. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404827796017159))
	- 6/ Go through all of your copywriting.  Make sure all your ads are impactful and respectful. Pictures of beaches are inconsiderate and insulting. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404828844646404))
	- 7/ 7 figure deals are off the table, most of those deals are public companies that can’t commit to large spends right now.  They will probably happen but the sales cycle is getting longer. 
	  5 figure deals are slowing. Some friction but not some. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404829813440512))
	- 8/ send out a ‘thank you for being a fan/customer’.  Offering up 2 free months works better than a percentage% off.  Feel free to offer old inventory to get them on a quarterly plan.  If you are already sitting with annuals with current customers, you should be ok, call them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404830849470466))
	- 9/ Some people not offering anything for free, but giving other options helps retain them works as well. 
	  It's ok to offer an unlimited plan or fair use, to get cash thru the door. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404831705071622))
	- 10/  you can offer / roll out downmarket plans.  Release new cheaper plans that people can not compare anything to.  Makes it easier to get people in the door. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404832602652674))
	- 11/  “If you’re taking the hit, we’ll take the hit with you” People who are dropping at 40% don’t have the money to pay me right now.  Create words for when things get better.  Assure them you are with them along this journey. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404833437401091))
	- 12/ This is going to end at some point, 2 months 18 months, some point.  Be the one that's holding the lead, nurture it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404834402099200))
	- 13/ Protect your downside more than normal. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404835236777988))
	- 14/ There is going to be massive losses and really big gains.  Unlike other downturns right now the fundamentals in the economy are good.  Movement and liquidity of capital is good. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404836025245697))
	- 15/ We can’t keep every single customer.  Some churn is inevitable - like if they go out of business. But you can prevent a lot of it, and you should focus heavily on proactive churn prevention ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404837057093635))
	- 16/ Revenue churn is ok (downgrades), customer churn is a customer gone for good. 
	  
	  Salvage offers should be offered. Retention is important.  Would rather keep the $25 customer than the churn. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404837954674688))
	- 17/ 30-40% of churn is usually because of credit card failures. You need to treat these folks as a marketing channel.  1 out of 5  are using it as an excuse to churn.  You are probably only recovering 25% of them.  Look to see what your flow is when people’s credit cards fail. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404838780952576))
	- 18/ The rules of normal are out the window.  Be careful not to look desperate.  Lock in a rate for the next 6-9 months.  Be the cure for the company, don’t be the problem. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404839657562112))
	- 19/ Optimize for user retention.  We all agree we will eventually get out of this and people will be paying again.  Rather optimize for this ending in the next year or so. You want to have the highest number of happy success customers regardless of whether they pay less. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404840639041536))
	- 20/ Increase your CS team with the people you have on your team rather than letting them go to work more on product.  Don’t let them go, change their skills, keep your company. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404841524056064))
	- 21/  Every single person who is onboarding get on the phone with them.  If you’re the sales leader or CEO get on the phone.   Nurture the business. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404842333540354))
	- 22/ If you have enough runway, go after the customers of your competitiors, buy out the contracts.  Offer the product for free for a year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404843176603648))
	- 23/ Using value-adds to retain customers is better than discounts in the long run. Which non-competing SaaS companies have your user base? Partner with them, offer your thing for free for a year to retained customers. This is lead gen for you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404844090888193))
	- 24/ If you’re using a free trial, consider offering a freemium for 6 months. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404844942340097))
	- 25/ Aggressively take the money that's out there right now. Offer professional services.  If you can upsell, do it. Take that money. Upsell as much as you can right now. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/peeplaja/status/1245404845760225288))
