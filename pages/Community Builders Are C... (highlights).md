- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- Community builders are creators too.
	  
	  But they’ve still largely been left out of the creator economy and indie community builders still lack means for monetizing.
	  
	  To understand why, we first have to understand how the dynamics differ for community builders vs content creators. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DavidSpinks/status/1407738581028950023))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Creators make content for people.
	  
	  Community builders make spaces for people to create content for each other.
	  
	  Creators are seen as the experts.
	  
	  Community builders are seen as organizers of experts.
	  
	  ⚠︎ As a result, community builders are seen as offering less value. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DavidSpinks/status/1407738584854151169))
	- Creators have “ownership” over their audience and can advertise to them.
	  
	  Communities feel like they are “owned” by their members.
	  
	  ⚠︎ As a result, community members are more resistant to advertising than content consumers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DavidSpinks/status/1407738586221449220))
	- It feels natural to charge people for premium content and it's easy to segment content for paying subscribers.
	  
	  It feels less inclusive to charge people for access to a community and segmentation of activity can hurt engagement.
	  
	  ⚠︎ As a result, communities stay free. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DavidSpinks/status/1407738587278413828))
	- Content platforms (youtube, tiktok, twitch, substack) build monetization into their product.
	  
	  The most popular community platforms (facebook, slack, discord) don't.
	  
	  ⚠︎ As a result, community builders lack the tools and aren't capturing any of the value they're creating. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DavidSpinks/status/1407738588385714179))
	- Many of the people who have successfully monetized communities are also content creators (ie. @lennysan, @DruRly, @theSamParr).
	  
	  Others sometimes end up acquired by a company that provides the monetization path (@cmx, @indiehackers, @makerpad) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DavidSpinks/status/1407738589568503808))
	- To solve the community monetization problem, we have to:
	  
	  1. Respect community builders as hard-working creators that create a great deal of value.
	  
	  2. Realize community builders have very different dynamics from other content creators, and require unique tools and solutions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DavidSpinks/status/1407738590629617669))
