	- One of the reasons I'm fired up about Bayesian Analysis for Business is because of MCMC (or Markov Chain Monte Carlo). 
	  
	  Here's what MCMC does + how to learn it with me.

	- Goal of Bayesian's are to estimate a posterior distribution. 
	  
	  From the posterior, the analyst can make predictions + confidence... 
	  
	  Keep in mind confidence is the key ingredient for analyzing risk (uncertainty)... 
	  
	  Super important for business analysis. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mdancho84/status/1576942494490669058))
	- Problem: We don't know the formula for the posterior.
	  
	  We could just approximate it as gausian or something (like frequentists do)...
	  
	  But this will lead to incorrect assumptions. 
	  
	  And poor confidence. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mdancho84/status/1576942496247996416))
	- Solution: Bayesians can use MCMC to sample from the distribution to obtain a posterior.
	  
	  This gives a much more **reliable** estimate of the true distribution.
	  
	  Pretty cool, right? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mdancho84/status/1576942497934155777))
	- If you want to learn how to implement Bayesian Modeling for Business Analysis, I have a free workshop coming up!
	  
	  I'll unleash the power of Bayesian on a Business Problem that helps us decide what offers to send customers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mdancho84/status/1576942499674759168))
	- And, do me a favor. 
	  
	  Let me know what questions you have about Bayesian so I can incorporate them into the Bayesian workshop. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mdancho84/status/1576942501361254402))
