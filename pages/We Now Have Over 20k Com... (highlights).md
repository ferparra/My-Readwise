	- We now have over 20k companies using @profitwell's freemium product. I used to argue with @hnshah and @bbalfour about how freemium is terrible. 
	  
	  Here's why I was wrong with a bunch of data ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/z8awVl2FJG ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Patticus/status/1298275244390547459))

	- So boomers will tell you that freemium devalues your product. The problem here is that you need to think about freemium as an acquisition model, not a revenue model. 
	  
	  Freemium is a premium ebook, not a pricing tier. 2/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Patticus/status/1298275247381151745))
	- Why is that important? 
	  
	  Well, customer acquisition costs have gone up nearly 70% over the past six years, because we haven't had a new marketing channel since 2015 (TikTok is pending) and the number of online businesses has gone up 10x. 
	  
	  We're all competing for attention. 3/

	- Ebooks were beautiful ways to get customer attention when @bhalligan and @dharmesh paved the way with Inbound marketing, but content CAC has been going up too - everyone has a blog. 
	  
	  Freemium is the next iteration of inbound. What better content do you have than your product? 4/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Patticus/status/1298275251239948291))
	- Here's some data to support this point. 
	  
	  Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) for those customers acquired through freemium tend to cost 30% less than those acquired through traditional sales. @searchbrat knows this well. 
	  
	  Why though? 5/

	- Well, prospects on freemium use the product or something tangential to the product and traditionally sign up on their own.
	  
	  More importantly you're putting the onus of conversion on the customer, rather than on a pressured sales process or a discount. 6/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Patticus/status/1298275254146666496))
	- Put more simply - freemium users are more qualified, bought in more, and convert at the right time vs. those going from a cold start. 
	  
	  More data support: Customers who convert from freemium tend to have 15-20% higher retention than those who came through traditional sales. 7/

	- Those customers who converted from freemium tend to be happier too. Here's a break down of NPS of paying customers based on which channel they came through originally. 
	  
	  NPS is higher because they converted when they were ready, not when you were ready. 8/

	- Couple of last bits: 
	  
	  1. As @wes_bush and @robwalling often mention, freemium is a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. Takes dedication to be done right. 
	  
	  2. Lots of freemium types. Here's the "Freemium Manifesto" I wrote expressing the *how* of freemium: https://t.co/1HpDnU1mZa

	- Ok back to my analyst box

	  Let me know what you want data on or a breakdown of next.
