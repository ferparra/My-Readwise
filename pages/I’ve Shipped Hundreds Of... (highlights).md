	- Iâ€™ve shipped hundreds of features. 
	  
	  As a Product Manager, if you want to lead what features your team builds, there's a critical trait you must develop:
	  
	  Influence.
	  
	  You can influence your leadership by developing a sound product strategy.
	  
	  Hereâ€™s how I did it ðŸ‘‡

	  3. Establish Vision
	  4. Gap Analysis
	  5. Develop Strategy
	  6. Tell the Story

	  Let's dive in ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1590337166244286466))
	- 1/ Review
	  
	  I'm not going to lie, this is a grind and can take a while.  But it is critical and will pay off when you develop an unshakable POV with your leadership.
	  
	  It starts with reviewing:
	  
	  1. Existing features
	  2. Customer research ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1590337168563736577))
	- 2/ Review: Features
	  
	  Through a review of customer usage *data*, determine the 5 top performing features of your product - based on how they have influenced your OKRs.
	  
	  Deep dive with your team to uncover the 1 key aspect of each feature that is resonating with customers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1590337170723807232))
	- 3/ Review: Customer Research
	  
	  From those top 5 performing features, find out what customer research led to the development of each feature.
	  
	  These 5 insights will likely continue to be a key part of your strategy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1590337172938317825))
	- 4/ Synthesize
	  
	  After conducting your review, you should have a clear sense of what features have been the most impactful for your OKRs and the customer research backing each feature.
	  
	  These insights will begin to form your strategy pillars. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1590337175081652224))
	- 5/ Establish Vision
	  
	  A vision can be anywhere from 3-10 years of what you envision your product achieving long term.
	  
	  My team didn't have a set strategy yet, so we started small with 3 years.
	  
	  Your vision should be ambitious and exciting, yet achievable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1590337177141100544))
	- 5/ Gap Analysis
	  
	  Once you've reviewed what's previously been successful and established your vision, you must figure out what's missing to achieve your vision.
	  
	  Doubling down on previous insights likely isn't enough.
	  
	  2 Steps here:
	  1. Competitive Analysis
	  2. Customer Research ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1590337179355680772))
	- 6/ Gap Analysis: Competitive Analysis
	  
	  Do *not* copy competitors.
	  
	  From competitors' features, you can infer what customer problems they are solving.  
	  
	  If you're scrappy, you can get a sense if they are working or not.
	  
	  Do your customers face similar problems? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1590337181578678272))
	- 7/ Gap Analysis: Customer Research
	  
	  What problems have you not solved for *your* customers?  
	  
	  Or has the market shifted such that your features no longer solve the problem?
	  
	  Take the time to conduct this research if you don't have anything readily available. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1590337183822520321))
	- 8/ Gap Analysis: Prioritize
	  
	  Prioritize both the existing and new problems based on opportunity.
	  
	  RICE is a favorite of many teams.  I wrote a detailed step by step process for this framework here -

	- 9/ Develop Strategy: Impact
	  
	  After prioritizing your opportunities top to bottom, determine the most impactful opportunities balanced with a low or reasonable level of effort.
	  
	  i.e. If your vision is 3 years, don't choose individual opportunities that will take 2 years to solve. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1590337188423782400))
	- 10/ Develop Strategy: Pillars
	  
	  Now organize your strategy into your pillars.  These are the structured customer problems you are solving.
	  
	  As a reminder, some of these will be re-investing in existing opportunity areas.  Some will be new. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1590337191049297920))
	- 11/ Tell the Story
	  
	  Bring the listener along the journey.
	  
	  (Exec Summary)
	  
	  1. What is the product?
	  2. History to date
	  3. What have we learned so far?
	  4. What are our customers telling us?
	  5. Establish vision
	  6. Introduce pillars
	  7. Estimated impact
	  8. Recap
	  
	  Build excitement. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1590337193234644996))
	- 12/ Summary
	  
	  The goal is to *influence* your leadership.  And you can accomplish that through a well articulated strategy.
	  
	  1. Review
	  2. Synthesize
	  3. Establish Vision
	  4. Gap Analysis
	  5. Develop Strategy
	  6. Tell the Story
	  
	  There are many frameworks out there.  This worked for me! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1590337195335892999))
