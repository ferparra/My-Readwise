	- There is a special place in hell for the person who made the decision to have leads and contacts as separate objects. It creates all kinds of complexity. Some may have a need to work with leads but for clean reporting, you almost have to dump leads. Most B2B companies I know don't use the lead object and autoconvert everything to Contacts. But it has always seemed like a bad decision to have both.
	- Sending emails directly or programmatically is pain, so we have Outreach and Salesloft. Entering data is too slow - so there's Dooly. Their marketing reporting stinks - so there is Fullcircle and Bizible. They own Pardot, yet somehow still can't top Marketo, Hubspot or Eloqua - which is a pretty amazing fail imho. And the Pardot integration really doesn't add a ton of value over other solutions. But as noted above, this weakness is also a strength because you've got a huge ecosystem.
	- If I'm starting a company right now, I'd probably go with Hubspot because there is just enormous power in the simplicity of having all of the data for both marketing and sales in a single system.
