	- The Great Refactor of my @obsdmd vault begins! 
	  
	  Today's project: Going through everything tagged "article" and splitting it off into nested tags so that they're more useful. 
	  
	  A brief ðŸ§µðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EleanorKonik/status/1483158511710318592))

	- @obsdmd Historically, I mostly used folders to differentiate between things, and this is still true overall. 
	  
	  Articles are the one thing in my vault I was never thrilled with the organization of, because some articles are born out of synthesis in my "slipbox," but many aren't. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EleanorKonik/status/1483158812794228736))
	- Some of my "articles ideas" are born of academic-style synthesis, but others are more like "hey I noticed these two books I like share a characteristic."
	  
	  They're born to be listicles, they don't feel at home in my slipbox. So they live in a "nonfic > wip" folder... with a tag ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EleanorKonik/status/1483159261475713026))
	- I used to use the same "article" tag for anything that felt like a longform piece of writing aimed at an audience instead of myself. 
	  
	  But it started to get really unwieldy. 
	  
	  I've finally settled on a system I think will work for me. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EleanorKonik/status/1483159451553177608))
	- I'm differentiating between "nonfic/articleSeed/type" and "nonfic/promote" so that I can more easily find something to work on depending on my needs. 
	  
	  nonfic/articleSeed/analysis when I need to ship something for my newsletter, like so:

	- I use nonfic/promote to indicate that something is "evergreen" content that I should refer to & resurface as appropriate. 
	  
	  There's also nonfic/twitterFodder for stuff I have thoughts on but not enough for an entire article (yet?). 
	  
	  i.e., short insights are handled differently. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EleanorKonik/status/1483160178493210627))
	- VERY short things I want to share get tagged now, as nonfic/newsletterIdea â€” I used to [[link]] to my [[newsletter ideas]] backlinks index, but I've discovered that I like having my tags visible as a sort of "todo list" and having the newsletter ideas tagged works best for that. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EleanorKonik/status/1483160594685509632))
	- Anyway, wish me luck! There's a lot to sort through, and many of these files have YAML setups that pre-date the data-task attribute obsidian supports now, so I need to move things into inline metadata too.
	  
	  It sounds tedious, but I actually appreciate these chances to review.
