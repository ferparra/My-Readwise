- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Jan 13th, 2023]]
	- Just launched a redesign of my site's homepage, incorporating advice I got from an audit @jayclouse did of my site.
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Here's the previous design.
	  
	  It's pretty, but as Jay rightly pointed out, it was unfocused and wasn't aligned with my goals.
	  
	  The huge header took up tons of space & added no information.
	  
	  Users had to scroll a lot to find any info on my Notion content/products.

	- Now, the home page immediately states the purpose of my site.
	  
	  I present visitors with action buttons, leading to the most important parts of the site right away.
	  
	  There's also a logo rail that helps to add a bit of social proof and trust.

	- The next section shows visitors:
	  
	  1. The most important content (related to my goal of helping people learn Notion
	  
	  2. My top products
	  
	  Most people will check out a site's home page; might as well use it to showcase your best stuff (and the stuff that makes money!)

	- Next up, the home page finally gives people an easy way to sign up for my newsletter.
	  
	  I neglected adding this to the homepage for FAR too long.

	- A bio section lets visitors learn more about me and what I do, and adds a bit more social proof.
	  
	  This bio is a bit of a first draft; in the near future I'll tweak it to include more Notion-specific stories and cred. 
	  
	  I wanted to ship fast and iterate over time.

	- Lastly, I chose to showcase a few of the interviews I've done and link to my most important social profiles.
	  
	  These add more social proof, and also let people easily connect with me or find all of my content (since most of it is on YouTube and here on Twitter).

	- The main navigation is also worth mentioning. It launched about a month ago – I designed it and @yomartholomew coded it from scratch (no menu plugins were good enough for our needs).
	  
	  It likewise improves navigation and UX, directing people to all the most important stuff. https://t.co/Ifo8RSAGxY ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1612572314721308673))
	- As for the tools I use:
	- The next thing I need to work on is speed optimization.
	  
	  The page actually loads quite fast, but there are definitely some Lighthouse improvements we can make.
	  
	  One is with layout shift, which unfortunately Elementor isn't good at. So we're looking at some other tools this year.

	- Here's the site if you'd like to check it out: https://t.co/1wAGgWeLDc
	  
	  I love sharing nerdy details like this, so ask questions if you have them!
	  
	  P.S. – What would you add or improve? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1612572323676147713))
	- @itsjacobkummer @webflow I'll certainly keep it in mind, but for now we're going to test out @wpspectra which adds design capability directly to Gutenberg and seems overall faster.
	  
	  I'm also an old hand at WP so it's a much clearer choice for me than for most people! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1612577776304852997))
