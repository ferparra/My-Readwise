document_note:: Gurwinder Bhogal discusses various concepts related to technology and psychology in his conversation with Jim O’Shaughnessy. He talks about the Woozle Effect where an article creates a claim with no evidence, and citing that claim creates the impression of corroboration, even though all are citing the same uncorroborated source. He also touches upon the Toxoplasma of Rage, where the narratives that do best in the digital world are those that divide people the most. He believes that AI will increase the amount of disinformation rather than reduce it. The conversation also covers topics like tribalism, the purity spiral, the golden hammer, and the risks of certainty. Ultimately, Bhogal advocates for cultivating a curiosity and humility to continue learning and avoiding moral hysterias that cause extremism.

	- **The Toxoplasma of Rage: Narratives that do the best in the digital age are narratives that not everybody thinks are true, but those that divide people the most**
	  
	  •   Writer [Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/) created this concept
	  •   Narratives that divide people the most will spread the furthest

	- Golden Hammer: When someone, usually an intellectual who has gained a cultish following for popularizing a concept, becomes so drunk with power he thinks he can apply that concept to everything ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gybdnkjhwy2tjqbav47b7pef))
	- People want to belong to a tribe, and one way that people belong to a tribe is by having the same beliefs as the members of that tribe ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gybdnzas0qdhw3dmqevbwr29))
		- **Tags**: #[[mimetic theory]]
	- Our minds are configured not to argue for what is true, but for what we want to believe and what we need to believe in order to be part of the tribe ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gybdp9qqytza6c7mmx9m1bmd))
	- The Narrative Fallacy: People prefer elaborate stories as explanations rather than trying to understand complex systems ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gybdpjh5z3c5we63tbz9wspg))

	- **Certainty Is The Death Of Thought** 
	  
	  •   **“Certainty is the death of thought.” –** ***Gurwinder Bhogal***
	  •   The moment you become certain about something, you stop thinking about it and you do not grow anymore 
	  •   It is optimal to have a little uncertainty about everything 
	  •   **The Curiosity Zone: Learn a little about a lot** 
	  •   **Curiosity is not the desire to fill your head with knowledge; it is the desire to fill gaps in your knowledge** 
	  •   Curiosity and humility go hand in hand 
	  •   Trying to be intelligent usually leads to stupidity 
	  •   Thinking in terms of probabilities instead of certainties will make you wiser, according to Jim O’Shaughnessy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gybdpxqgwg2m9et0te6n2q01))
		- **Note**: •   **“Certainty is the death of thought.” –** ***Gurwinder Bhogal*** - When we are certain about something, it means we stop thinking about it and we don't learn any more. 
		  •   It is better to be a little unsure about everything. 
		  •   **The Curiosity Zone: Learn a little about a lot** - It's really important to be curious and learn lots of different things. 
		  •   **Curiosity is not the desire to fill your head with knowledge; it is the desire to fill gaps in your knowledge** - When we are curious, we are looking for answers to things we don't know. 
		  •   Curiosity and humility go hand in hand - When we are humble, it means we are open to learning new things. 
		  •   Trying to be intelligent usually leads to stupidity - Trying too hard to be smart can actually make us do things that are not so smart. 
		  •   Thinking in terms of probabilities instead of certainties will make you wiser, according to Jim O’Shaughnessy - If we think of things as possibilities instead of certainties, we can become smarter and wiser.
