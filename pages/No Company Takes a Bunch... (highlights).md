	- No company takes a bunch of subject matter experts, sends them to a class, and then makes them a software engineer.
	  
	  So why is that okay for Product Managers?

	- Here’s where I’m going with this. A class is fine. You should send them to a class but this is where most large, transformations stop, and say “good enough.”
	  
	  Here’s what they also should do: /2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lissijean/status/1431212173406126086))
	- 1. Hire more experienced PMs in to help mentor and coach. SO MANY DON’T. I am all for apprenticeship. You need someone to learn from if you’ve never done it before. /3 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lissijean/status/1431212174983172099))
	- 2. Make sure middle managers have actually done PM before so there is an actual experienced group of leaders who can steer. You can’t train an entire company into PM at every level. /4 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lissijean/status/1431212175645945868))
	- 3. There needs to be continued development of PMs from further education, communities of practice, etc. /5 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lissijean/status/1431212176262455301))
	- 4. The systems and culture in the org need to change to embrace the PMs and how they work. If you don’t do the work here, they can’t implement what they learned in class. /6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lissijean/status/1431212176895795201))
	- That’s it. That’s what I’m saying. You can’t send an entire group from a company to one class and say “TADA! You’re PMs now!” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lissijean/status/1431212177642463232))
	- Actually one more thing to add.
	  
	  Without having people from experienced PM backgrounds to watch, SMEs tend to get stuck in “well this is how our industry works” and can’t think outside the box creatively. /7 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lissijean/status/1431212867227897859))
	- They don’t understand that a platform approach in software can be useful for banks or in healthcare we can borrow best practice user flows from certain B2B SaaS.
	  
	  Obviously I’m generalizing but I often see a “this won’t work here” mentality if you don’t mix it up. /8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lissijean/status/1431212868163211271))
