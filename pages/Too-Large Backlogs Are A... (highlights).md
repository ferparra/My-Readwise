	- Too-large backlogs are a disease. You’ll never get to most of the stuff on them, and they’re impossible to manage. Solve that problem by limiting the size of the backlog based on measured throughput (average number of stories completed per sprint) and split factor. 1/6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1388916800071471105))

	- The split factor is the number of small (2-day max) stories you can get out of one story on the backlog. You want about 2 iterations worth of work in the backlog at most, so the formula is:
	  
	  (number of teams * (throughput / split factor) * 2)

	- E.g.: you have 6 teams. On average, you complete 4 stories per Sprint. You get 2 small stories out of every large story on the backlog, so the max size is: 6 * (4 / 2) * 2  = 24 stories.

	- Once you’ve done that, everybody MUST respect that limit. Nothing goes into the backlog until something comes out. This backlog is small enough that it’s best represented either by stickies on the wall or the virtual equivalent. Dump Jira.

	- Let the people who are currently putting things into the backlog fight over slots when they become available. They’ll soon learn to put only the most valuable things in it.
