document_note:: The author suggests that the stoics can be regarded as emotional preppers because they prepare for difficult times and strive to minimize negative emotions. They also practice what they preach and are known to be cheerful individuals who appreciate and savor the positive emotions they experience. Furthermore, they have an insight that much of our unhappiness is self-inflicted, and they strive to frame negative experiences in a way that can extract the light from them.

- In this episode of The Knowledge Project, Shane Parrish interviews William Irvine, a professor of philosophy and author of A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy. In the interview, Irvine explains Stoic philosophy and how it can be used to live a more meaningful life. He explains that Stoicism is a philosophy of life that focuses on being content with what you have and not allowing external circumstances to determine your internal state. He also discusses how to use Stoic principles to deal with negative emotions, create a daily routine, and live a more fulfilling life.
