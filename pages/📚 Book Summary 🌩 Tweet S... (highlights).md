	- Innovator’s Dilemma
	  https://t.co/rRbnaio4qT
	  
	  For groundbreaking innovations, there are times when you should not listen to customers, invest in a lower performance product, with lower margins and pursue a rather small market — which is all counterintuitive to large organisations.

	  https://t.co/Z2syvu42Ie
	  
	  More choice does not make people better off because of adaptation, regret, missed opportunity, raised expectation and feelings of inadequacy in comparison with others.
	  
	  We regret most the things we didn’t do, not the ones we did do. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/batkomichael/status/1172703054677757954))

	- Name of the Wind
	  https://t.co/wQIlouJeZG
	  
	  If you want to know the truth of who you are, walk until not a person knows your name. Travel is a great teacher, bitter as medicine.

	- Algorithms to Live By
	  https://t.co/fgGUVK6FPd
	  
	  Up against hard cases, effective algorithms make assumptions, trade-off the costs of error against the cost of delay and take chances. These aren’t the concessions we make when we can’t be rational. They’re what being rational means. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/batkomichael/status/1172715617125666817))

	- Good Strategy, Bad Strategy
	  https://t.co/oburEjzHug
	  
	  A Good Strategy identifies the one or two critical issues — and then focuses and concentrates action and resources on them.
