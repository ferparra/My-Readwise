	- Planner app is coming along nicely. It's going to be a solid example of "web apps" with Remix.
	  
	  I know some folks see the simple server side action + html form APIs and think "oh, just old school PHP stuff" but we have way more ambition with Remix than what we built back in 2002.

	- We probably over-emphasize the "Remix works w/o JS!" progressive enhancement tricks.
	  
	  But that's really just a fun side effect of Remix basing it's APIs on web fundamentals.
	  
	  Our real goal is great user experiences. The best ones come with some carefully delivered JavaScript. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1475514433182965763))
