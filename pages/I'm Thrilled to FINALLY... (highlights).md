	- We spoke with > 30 users and builders of thought processing software. From users we learned common behavioral patterns and what they want from their tooling, and from builders we learned their design questions and philosophy. We also introspected our own workflows and needs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1527710675174166528))
	- This notebook is meant to support builders in this space: View this as a framework for navigating the idea maze, and form your own conclusions about the claims, questions, and trails between them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1527710676323512320))
	- Building a discourse graph that scales to large amounts of content is no small task. Building one that enables people to communicate and synthesize better together through a shared data structure is even harder.
	  
	  We've put together a frame for builders exploring these questions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1527710677439111170))
	- A special thank you to @graphgrants for making this research possible, and to @_jzhao for your support using Quartz to publish.
	  
	  As this is a living notebook, please ask questions in the replies or in the comments section on pages to guide its evolution!
