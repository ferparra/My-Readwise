And the stock was down like ten, 11 % yesterday. And this is like a very stable, very mature, third largest producer of starch in the united states, and their business got totally hammered. But it took a while before that hit them a and so, you know, it feels to me, ryan, i mean, correctly if i'm wrong, but like a lot of the the the business level, ind market level risk isn't going to show up for a while, after the supply chain problems really persist within their organization. This is the thing that has to ben most concerned is what what's happened is it's now taking a hundred and 15 days, on average across our customer base, from when the factory hay, these goods are ready come pick them up, to when they finally get delivered bywarehouse in the united states. Ra nderd 15 days before the pandemic, that was 50 and 50 even felt high, like the ship is only taking 15 days. Like, what the heck has gone on?

	- How do you build an unfair advantage in AR/VR?
	  
	  Summary:
	  i think chamoth is a great point you bring up, because they also started investing in their own chip set. And i think all of that chip set innovation gives them a dramatic advantage in having smaller batteries and more processing power if it works. What ship asset does Facebook have, none? So i don't want, i don't think we should say that facebook is down and out, but let's just qualify what we think can win.

	  Even better than that, chamoth is a great point you bring up, because they also started investing in their own chip set. And i think all of that chip set innovation gives them a dramatic advantage in having smaller batteries and more processing power in ahead set, if it does work, which what ships does. What ship asset does? Facebook have, none.

	  So i don't want, i don't think we should say that facebook is down and out, but let's just qualify what we think can win. So that's one thing. The other thing to remember is, when you look at the pc industry, how did intel become so dominant? Part of what inte was able to do to out compete a m d and everybody else, was that programme cal intell inside, which as effectively these co marketing paths through dollars that they would use to actually give an incentive for dell and for compact and for all these other folks to basically built a speck. And that was the wind tell monopoly, right? Microsoptand intel, if you play that out in vr, what you really need is just a bag full of cash. Because if you give developers a subsidized incentive to build for your platform, they'll do it. So then again, if you rank the companies, you just need to look at how much cash do they have, because those with the motar cash have so again, i think the best way to think about this is, how many developers do you have to day?
