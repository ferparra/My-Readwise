	- His first revolutionary idea was that light came in little packets, photons, and were not only a wave
	  Second was the theory and later proven that particles and atoms definitely exist
	  Third is special relativity – observers are moving at a constant velocity relative to each other. General relativity came 10 years later.
	- His key insight to solve that light moves at a constant velocity is that time is not absolute. What appears to be happening simultaneously to one observer will not appear so to another who is moving rapidly and there is no way to determine who is right
	- If time is relative, so is speed and distance. There are some things which do not vary – space/time, speed of light
	- General relativity [[thought experiment]] – person in an elevator feeling their feet pressed on the floor will not know the difference of accelerating upward in space or being stationary in a gravitational field. Same concept with weightlessness in the elevator
	- Gravity arises around the curvature of space/time
	- Einstein always concerned with covariance – somebody moving at the same and constant speed as moving object should observe the same phenomenon as somebody at rest observing an object at rest
	- Was trying to disprove quantum entanglement for a while – where 2 particles who are at a distance from each other are somehow connected and when one particle changes direction, so will the other. This “spooky action at a distance” was confirmed in the 1980s.
