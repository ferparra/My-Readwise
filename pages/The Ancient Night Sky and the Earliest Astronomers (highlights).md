	- The Concept of Proper Motion
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* The North Star will change in about 13,000 years., * Proper motion tells us how a star appears to move in the sky., * Earth is moving around the sun, which means when we're on one side of the sun, stars can appear to be in a different position than when we're on the other side of the sun.)

	  So it's kind of like a top that you spin and as it starts to kind of wobble before it eventually falls down. Exactly.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  But this does take place over 26,000 years. So it's pretty slow, especially compared to human time scales, but we can still notice it. So right now, our North Star is called Polaris. But in about 13,000 years, the Earth's axis will have moved enough that our new North Star will be the most important part of the Earth's axis. And the North Star will be Vega. And something like 3000 years ago, in the time of the ancient Greeks and late ancient Babylonians, the star that our axis pointed to would have been different.

	  Can you talk a little bit about maybe the concept of proper motion and like how, like even the constellations and these other stars are going to shift a bit over time, especially if we were to step back in time to, you know, like, two or three years ago. And like 200 million years ago.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Absolutely. I love that you brought up proper motion as an astronomer who did many research projects based on the motion and position of stars that has been the bane of my existence in the past. So proper motion tells us how a star appears to move in the sky as Earth moves through space. So Earth is moving around the sun, which means when we're on one side of the sun, stars can appear to be in a different position than when we're on the other side of the sun. But our son is also moving through the galaxy. We're moving. It takes us about 250 million years to make one full round. Wow. Also, we have to remember that not all of the stars we see are technically disk stars. Some of them are in the halo of the Milky Way, so they're passing in and out of the disk. And they don't have to follow this circular motion. ([TimeÂ 0:09:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/53b816a8-0fef-4965-ba77-43598f5c3633))
