document_note:: The text describes the special relationship that was built between basketball legend Bill Russell and coach Red Auerbach over decades. Russell was taught from a young age to stand up for himself and be loyal, devoted and committed. Despite his unorthodox game, Russell earned a national championship and averaged 20 points and 20 rebounds a game, but was still not seen as good. Red and Bill shared a sense of knowing what was important and bucking conventional wisdom in order to win. Red was a great listener and had a deep understanding of human nature. He was also great at getting people to buy into the team mission and was able to treat everyone as equals and with respect. Bill studied his teammates and competitors in order to be most effective, and Red had a masterful way of balancing the team hierarchy in order to keep everyone bought in. The most valuable lesson that Red and Bill learned was to play like a child, but not childish.
