	- The role of ABCA1 in the formation of HDL
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* HDL is formed when APOB A1 is secreted from the cells., * ABCA1 is responsible for taking lipid and cholesterol from the cells and exporting them to HDL., * Humans that lack ABCA1 have virtually undetectable HDL.)

	  What we've really learned in the last decade or so is that APOB A1 is put into the blood by either the intestinal enterocyte or the hepatocyte in the liver as more or less of free protein. So it's secreted as a protein. One of the first steps that has to happen for HDL to be formed is that HDL, once it comes out of the cell, engages with a key transport protein called ABCA1. And Peter, stop me if I'm already getting too detailed. ABCA1, we'll come back to that, which its role, ABCA1's role is to take lipid, cholesterol and other types of lipids called phospholipids from the cell and export them to the newly secreted APOB A1. So APOB A1 has to acquire lipid, particularly phospholipid and cholesterol, soon after it's been secreted in order for the so-called nascent or early HDL to start forming. We'll come back to this when we talk about genetics, but we know this because humans that lack ABCA1 have virtually undetectable HDL.
