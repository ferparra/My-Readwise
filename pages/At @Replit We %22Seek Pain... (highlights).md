	- At @Replit we "seek pain." You can't learn unless you ship real product to real people and then dig into what's not working and fix it. Successful businesses are always learning and learning is often painful at first. Yet we're naturally hardwired to resist pain.

	- In HS I played football. One of the first drills on the first day of practice was tackling. You'll always remember the first time you run straight into another human. Your entire body screams NO! But you keep at it until it becomes natural. You learn.

	- Sales is like tackling. It's painful at first. Making a tough ask and letting the silence hang in the air, always getting a next step, getting people to say no, picking up the phone, coolly facing constant rejection, digging for someone's why. It's learned, not natural.

	- Management is like tackling. It's painful at first. Delivering tough feedback directly yet compassionately, changing your style to match your reports who are all unique, saying no to a thousand good options because there's only one best option. It's learned, not natural.

	- Programming is like tackling. It's painful at first. Solving hard new problems with no idea where to start, searching & searching for bugs when it should just work, understanding other humans so you can write legible code even when that's slower. It's learned, not natural.

	- If you like to seek pain. If the idea of being comfortable all the time is deeply uncomfortable, @Replit might be the place for you. 
	  
	  We're all builders, the engineers and the business people. We ship. We dig into what's not working. We fix it. And we learn.
