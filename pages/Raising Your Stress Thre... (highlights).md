	- Raising your stress threshold & not getting triggered is not a mysterious process. It involves learning to suppress action and speech despite high levels of adrenaline. Science supported tools for this = ice baths, cold showers, cyclic hyperventilation w/60sec pauses every min. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1471256890231296004))

	- Of course be smart: don’t do the hyperventilation in water (!) and realize that the goal is not to become passively detached to your experience but rather to maintain mental clarity and adaptive  decision making despite the increased adrenaline in your brain and body.

	- And yes, learning to remain quiet with high levels of adrenaline in your brain and body is useful. Don’t distract yourself by “going elsewhere” doing math or singing in your head, etc. Grit, resilience and mental toughness are about leaning in, not checking out.

	- And once again, DON’T hyperventilate or do breath holds in/near water. Avoid black out/pass out drowning at all costs. If you want to learn to free dive, do it with a professional and a spotter. Or not at all. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1471262020888530947))
