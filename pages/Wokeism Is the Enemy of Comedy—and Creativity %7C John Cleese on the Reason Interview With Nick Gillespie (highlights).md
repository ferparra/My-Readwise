document_note:: John Cleese, an English actor, comedian, screenwriter, producer, author, and satirist, discusses with Nick Gillespie how wokeness is negatively impacting the environment necessary for creativity. He believes that while you can't teach creativity, you can teach people to create the circumstances in which it can flourish. Wokeism is seen as an interruption of creativity, as people are often scared of change and instead of embracing it, they wait for the thrill of being offended. Cleese believes that politics can be funny, but not solemn, and humor can be found in a serious discussion.
