	- Many teams tend to collect as much data as possible and dig through it looking for interesting questions to ask, instead of collecting data when itâ€™s needed to answer questions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eldh/status/1357066234496495621))
	- Data doesnâ€™t show nuance, uncertainty or complexity. It gives us an illusion of exactness. Data can tell us what is happening, but not why. Data can describe the problem, but not the solution. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eldh/status/1357066238095196163))
	- Instead we could let our decisions be guided by quality feedback from users, together with our own vision, empathy, skill, taste and intuition. We could build relationships, engage in conversations and listen to feedback. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eldh/status/1357066243526819844))
	- I absolutely love the feedback we get from customers @linear_app â€“ on twitter, via email and in our customer slack. The type of knowledge we get from those channels makes our product million times better than it would have been if we had just tracked KPI:s and success metrics.

	- We should let our systems â€“ the things we build and the processes we follow â€“ be humane and organic. Let it show that they are crafted by people, let them evolve and improve, let them be flawed, quirky and opinionated. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eldh/status/1357066255262482433))
