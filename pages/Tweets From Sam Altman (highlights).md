	- Move faster. Slowness anywhere justifies slowness everywhere.
	  
	  2021 instead of 2022. This week instead of next week. Today instead of tomorrow.

	- challenge for companies based on LLMs--they can do a lot of technical work to get a current-generation model to perform ok, and then have it get beat by a next-gen model out of the box.
