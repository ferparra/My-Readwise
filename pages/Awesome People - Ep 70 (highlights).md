	- COOs often make $100-150k more than a Director-level hire. If the COO can produce $300k more in sales

	- In what context did they work with the candidate? What are the candidate’s strengths? Weaknesses?What advice would they give as the candidate’s future manager? Where do they excel? Where do they need the most help? Would they hire the candidate again? (I particularly love this one. “I would, but not for my team,” can often be code for, “they are not a team player.”)
