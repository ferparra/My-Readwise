	- Some Product Managers (PMs) lack a nuanced understanding of Product Design disciplines.
	  
	  They provide direction & feedback to Product Designers in tiring and limiting ways, and fail to build an effective relationship with Product Designers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995203947278341))

	- I want to try and provide guidance on how PMs can effectively collaborate with and empower their Product Designers to design amazing customer experiences. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995215120936960))
	- Tips on Collaborating with Product Designers
	  
	  Tip #1: Build the customer problem with clarity
	  
	  All design is rooted in the problem it‚Äôs solving. 
	  
	  We should make sure to communicate any challenge that may arise due to technology, business strategy & operations, compliance, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995231549935616))
	- Prioritize the problem space and features that the team and Product Designer are solving.
	  
	  As PMs sometimes we think we have to singlehandedly decide everything.
	  
	  It‚Äôs totally fine to collaborate, 
	  encourage and welcome input from the Product Designers and rest of the team. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995253788004354))

	- If the customer problem is not well understood, your first task is to get that sorted.
	  
	  Always try to protect the Product Designer from pressure by well-intentioned stakeholders who want the Product Designer to just dive into designing the solution. 
	  
	  Context matters! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995271861440513))
	- Tip #2: Provide open-ended feedback, not prescriptive feedback
	  
	  Many PMs and reviewers give overly prescriptive feedback to the Product Designer . 
	  
	  That is, they tell the Product Designer exactly how to design the solution. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995312101597193))
	- This is nonsensical, as the Product Designer typically has the deepest skills in design, is the most informed on current and emerging design trends and patterns, and collaborates with their peers across a company to ensure cohesion of experiences. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995328350367747))
	- Everyone dislikes prescriptive feedback, regardless of role. 
	  
	  Being told not just what to do but also how to do it is often unhelpfully limiting and crosses the line into micromanagement. 
	  
	  If you do this, your Product Designers will dread working with you (and I would too). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995335245803527))
	- Open-ended feedback on the other hand focuses on the problem to be solved and challenges the Product Designer to think through options. 
	  
	  Ask probing questions. It‚Äôs totally appropriate to tell them when their options are missing the mark, ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995351024689153))
	- just make sure to explain why and let them think it over.
	  
	  Most Product Designers welcome feedback from their PM counterpart ‚Äî it just needs to be delivered thoughtfully. The more proficient you get at delivering feedback in helpful, constructive, open-ended ways, the better. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995365365096459))
	- Tip #3: When giving feedback, focus on Information Architecture / Interaction design first, then Visual design
	  
	  You can quickly assess the level of sophistication of a given non-Product Designer partner based on the questions and feedback they provide on a prototype. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995377423724554))
	- "I don‚Äôt like that color, can we change it to X?"
	  
	  "I don‚Äôt like that image, can we change it to Y?"
	  
	  "I don‚Äôt like the shape of that button, can we‚Ä¶" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995381114679301))
	- Comments like these can be tiresome for Product Designers,
	  
	  because visual design concerns such as color palette and imagery are governed by well-defined brand standards that the Product Designer is maintaining alignment with. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995384688222210))
	- It‚Äôs not that such feedback isn‚Äôt useful, it‚Äôs that there are other first-order concerns that should be addressed first.
	  
	  Therefore, make sure to give feedback on Information Architecture / Interaction design systems first. It‚Äôs OK to give feedback on Visual design. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995388383354881))
	- but if you focus on that to the neglect of getting the Information Architecture / Interaction design right, you‚Äôre focusing on the wrong things and signaling to your Product Designer that you lack design sophistication. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995848469123077))
	- Tip #4: Have your Product Designer‚Äôs back during design reviews with stakeholders
	  
	  Some Product Designers can deftly navigate feedback from stakeholders in real-time, but it‚Äôs way easier if the PM actively supports the Product Designer to make sure sessions is productive. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431995962344579073))
	- As a Product Manager, I believe it‚Äôs my responsibility to provide air cover and crowd control for my Product Designers in design reviews, as these can get rather intense with passionate stakeholders. 
	  
	  Don‚Äôt leave your Product Designers out to dry. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431996232243761157))
	- There are many ways you can do this as the PM:
	  
	  1. Before the meeting, make sure to prep with the Product Designer. Have them walk you through the prototype, so you can provide feedback on refining it. Let them know who the stakeholders are and the things they care about. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431996336166084613))
	- You don‚Äôt ever want to blindside your Product Designer or make yourself look smart at their expense ‚Äì this massively erodes trust
	  
	  2. Make sure the feedback and discussion stay aligned with the objectives for a given review. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431996426557480966))
	- Make sure that reviewers are expressing their concerns about the experience, not providing detailed solutions. Designing by committee is a surefire path to mediocre experiences. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431996545663131650))
	- Everyone has an opinion on design (esp. on Visual design), but not everyone is equipped to meaningfully synthesize compelling options ‚Äî that‚Äôs the Product Designer‚Äôs job. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431996635295453184))
	- Tip #6: Express your appreciation
	  More so than any role, Product Designers face a constant stream of criticism of their work, some of it not particularly constructive nor tactfully delivered. This can really wear on a person. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431996730652901377))
	- Let your Product Designer know when they‚Äôre kicking ass and why / how. When they go the extra mile, make sure to thank them.
	  
	  Obviously, you should do that for anyone you work with, but Product Designers experience more criticism than any other role. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431996854246461444))
	- Tip #7: Educate yourself on design
	  It can be argued that this should be the first step, but realistically education is a process that takes time.
	  
	  Look at every product and service you use as a consumer with an eye for Product Design. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431996955178278923))
	- Ask your Product Designer a lot of questions and pick up the lingo.
	  
	  Most Product Designers are delighted to share knowledge with their PM ‚Äî this levels up the partnership and makes it more effective. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/idamezhim/status/1431997058404204544))
