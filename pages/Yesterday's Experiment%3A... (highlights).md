	- Yesterday's experiment: prompt engineering and @pandas_dev. The key idea here is to send data and metadata to [[gpt-3]] along with the prompt. Here's an example of what it can do and the prompt. Yes it's the same excellent demo scenario from the approximatelabs/sketch demo. ðŸ§µ1/

	- Here's a video of it in action (sorry about lack of editing - unfamiliar new software). You're looking at the native Jupyter experience in @code which has GitHub CoPilot enabled within the notebook - that's what's generating the prompts when I type. https://t.co/wSX2fPJNQj 2/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/john_lam/status/1615432135183331328))
	- I implemented this mostly as an experiment to see how simple this could be. You can see for yourself - it's 112 lines of Python. Link to the code: https://t.co/cykVIwji13 3/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/john_lam/status/1615432139587350529))
	- Full credit to this excellent project for the inspiration and the scenario. I also borrowed the retrieve_name() function from their code and learned something new along the way! https://t.co/iNaTP5e2yh 4/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/john_lam/status/1615432144008138752))
