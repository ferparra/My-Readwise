	- **REM sleep disturbance (kicking, punching, screaming, acting out dreams) has a positive predictive value of over 90% that you will go on to develop either Parkinson’s disease or Lewy body dementia**
	  
	  •   This usually happens 20-30 years before a physical symptom will onset
	  •   The gold standard for assessing REM sleep disturbance is polysomnography – but the bed partner can accurately identify with 80% sensitivity
	  •   Additional considerations: toxic exposures, water source, movement assessment (grounding through the non-dominant leg) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxc9tyfv93y547y1gg7zve8b))
	- •   **Olfactory test:** 9 things you smell; the idea is that cranial nerve 1 is the olfactory nerve – smell feeds directly into memory so it’s one of the first parts to degenerate in disease
	  •   Reading, registering, auditory, and visual memory function tests – for example, when you read something, do you remember it? When you hear something, do you remember it? etc.
	  •   **Additional cognitive exercises:** attention tasks, speed of processing tasks, episodic memory (what order you saw something), visuospatial processing, verbal learning ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxc9ve5t1kmpeh5yg90eb933))
