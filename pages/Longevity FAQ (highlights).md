	- If you take many genetically distinct mouse strains and put them on the same diet (cutting calories by ~40%), sometimes fewer than 1/5 of the mouse strains live longer. Diet composition also plays a role. Just decreasing protein or a specific amino acid, while keeping total calorie intake the same, can result in a lifespan extension in mice. Feeding mice a ketogenic diet also seems to help. Decreasing food intake by too much will result in starvation, so finding a diet that works can depend on the situation.
	- A paper published in the 70's showed that linking old and young female mice so that they share a bloodstream increased lifespan. Decades later, in 2005, scientists at Stanford showed that this procedure might help old muscle stem cells repair wounds.
	- The big questions to resolve will be whether we can isolate a few key factors that are responsible for the parabiosis effect
	- As you get old, so do your cells. But some of your cells get old in a way that is much worse than the others. You may have heard of a thing called telomerase. If you remember correctly, it's the thing that keeps the end of your DNA long enough that your cells can still divide. When one of your cells runs out of telomerase, it can't make many more copies of itself.
	- As the lysosome gets older, more junk builds up in it that it cannot degrade. Finding ways to make more lysosomes, or help lysosomes degrade junk, may be interesting therapeutic avenues to pursue.
	- We know that the hypothalamus makes something called growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), which is in charge of, well, releasing growth hormone. Growth hormone appears to be closely tied to lifespan, so the hypothalamus could be an important control point.
	- There are also many reports showing that when you make things live longer, fertility goes down.
	- One concept that comes up when people talk about mitochondria is 'oxidative stress' - the idea that if molecules are very reactive (say they have oxygen, acquire some extra electrons, and now want to discharge them onto other molecules), they are likely to interfere with a lot of other molecules in the cell that should be left to their own devices.
	- Sirtuins add tags to the structural protein balls that DNA wraps around. It sounds odd, but think of yarn wrapping around a cardboard tube. When they add tags to the DNA yarn ball, it changes how the DNA is folded and expressed. So one of their actions is to control what genes do.
