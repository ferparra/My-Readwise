	- Why are money flows to equities increasing while bearishness is at a maximum? This is something we haven’t seen before, and intuitively doesn’t make much sense. If investors are super-bearish on market direction, why and how is money being added to equities? A few reasons:🧵 👇

	- 1. Passive pension flows happen every day, whether we like it or not. People don’t often change their pension allocation, and thus money coming keeps coming in to stocks. The 401k (or equivalent), as long as people get a salary, the employer contributions keep flowing in. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ecommerceshares/status/1539347346961715200))
	- 2. Every single one of the last equity downturns (2016, 2018, 2020, 2022) has been resolved very quickly. People who sold when things looked bad missed out on very large and relatively fast gains. Thus FOMO keeps many invested, as they expect “this” to resolve quickly again.

	- 3. Not only do people not want to sell when down, but Buy the F**king Dip has become a state of mind, as people have made so much money buying dips during all the recent downturns. Thus, there’s almost an addiction among many investors and a constant need to BTFD. “Easy gains!”. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ecommerceshares/status/1539347361536909312))
	- 4. People still believe in the “Fed put”: that the Fed will save the market if things get too bad. It’s a pre-conditioning of investors since the 2008: the Fed bail-out. Most investors simply don’t know anything else than this market regime, and can’t imagine anything else. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ecommerceshares/status/1539347364082851840))
	- 5. The causes of the current downturn, inflation, is poorly understood. Last time it happened was in the 1970’s-early ‘80s, and almost no investors or even theorists active then are active today. Most investors simply lack mental models and frameworks for how to incorporate it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ecommerceshares/status/1539347365819301888))
	- 6. Many investors believe that stocks in their sector look “very cheap”. No matter if you’re an energy / commodity investor (“look at the 5x PE!”) or SAAS investor (“only 10x sales now, not 50x!”), many feel happy to put money to work at these levels.

	- 7. The alternative to equities, bonds, look terrible as real yields are all time low. Many investors who previously liked fixed income now just don’t want to lock in money into bonds at these rates while base rates go up and credit risk rises. Equities thus look better to them.

	- 8. Very large capital gains accumulated during the post-GFC bull market prevent people from selling & taking money out from the market. Many mega caps have done 10-50x since the GFC, and people don’t want to pay outsized cap gains on them and “start from scratch”. Why sell $GOOG?

	- 9. We have been taught over the last decade that “Time in the market beats time the market”. There’s a whole industry of people on social media that are strong proponents of averaging in and just adding to your equities portfolio every month, no matter how markets are doing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ecommerceshares/status/1539347371850604544))
	- 10. The economy still looks strong to many and a “recession” is not visible. Anyones who’s been out to eat, at a conference, a mall or airport sees massive economic activity. Shortages are still the norm. The equities downturn is not visible in real life yet, and thus not scary. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ecommerceshares/status/1539347373327060993))
	- In summary, recent experience has pre-conditioned us not to sell when markets get bad. “We can’t lose!”. Thus, investors add or don’t sell equities. We love to BTFD on the cheap. Something has to break hard for this to change, as it’s so embedded into investor minds.
