	- Do You Have to Work at Your Marriage?
	  
	  Summary:
	  There's a great line from annie lamott, her name for god, not me. And most of us naturally see ourselves as got sad of the universe. Most important thing easy. I think one of the great advantages of marriage is to remind youa it's not all about you. Some people find that appealing and some people don't.

	  Could you say more about the diminishing of the responsibilities of marriage and what you mean by that?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  The part i like about you have to work at your marriage is it is hard. There're parts about marriage that are hard. Therese parts about having a good marriage that are difficult, that are challenging. There's a great line from annie lamott, her name for god, not me. Ha, ha, ha, ha. And most of us naturally see ourselves as got sad of the universe. Most important thing easy. And i think one of the great advantages of marriage is to remind youa it's not all about you. And you know, some people find that appealing and some people don't. I think i took this line out of the book, but i have a friend who said, until you get married, his father told him this, until you get married, you're an idiot. I feel that sometimes. I think there's a lot of truth to that. And living with another person is a commitment. ([Time 0:52:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2238f0c8-72ae-4e8b-aa28-3bcbc7f7d661))
	- Are You an Idiot?
	  
	  Summary:
	  "It's a great thing, i think, to admit that i'm not grown up. I haven't figured it all out," says Vesayiti. "A lot of what to me, of a life well lived is about growing up", he adds.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Ha, ha, ha, tat's it, exactly. Check vesayiti. A slightly different way, i've come to believe, as i've got an older that a huge part of qo growing up. And we like to joke, hey, tim, what ar you gin o do winh you grow up. You don't like, like you still have room to grow. Well, i hope you do, right?
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  You're not all oe ebsly.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  It's, it's like shalem, right? You're not whole. You're not grown up. One of the funniest things in life is you look at the people older than you and you think, when i'm their age, i'll feel the way they do. And you get to that age and you don't, right? You look at the, you look at the seniors in high school, right? When you're a sophomare, well, they're so confident and they seem so at ease. I can't wait till i'm a senior. Then you're a seniors like they, we're all faking it, every one of em, right? And it's a great thing, i think, to admit that i'm not grown up. I haven't figured it all out. Not mature, full more mature maybe than i was before, but i'm not mature. It's hard. So a lot of what to me, of a life well lived is about growing up. And marriage is one way to grow up, not the only way. There are other ways to grow up. Religion, meditation, psycho rapy, marriage, they're all about self awareness. They're all, if they're done well, they're all about recognizing that you're part of a much bigger picture than you feel like most of the time. And i think that's really helpful andt incredibly satisfying when you sense it. Great. ([Time 0:55:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/df829e47-20b3-4101-abdd-e1cd601e3e80))
	- How High Should You Build Your House?
	  
	  Summary:
	  The past is not necessarily a good predict of the future, says Skid. The s t p 500 has never had a ten year period with a negative return. If i invest all my money in thesup 500 and don't touch it for a decade, what's the worst thing that could happen? Well, something worse than has happened before, possibly.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  And you'd be wrong, because the past is not necessarily a good predict of the future. And we all know that. That's the most trivial, obvious thing. And yet, to take another financial example, oh, well, the s t p 500. There's never been a ten year period with a negative return. I don't even remember now. Whatever it is, take all the different decades, and i don't mean 19 20 o, 19 30, 19 30 o, 19 forty. I mean 21, 31, 22 32, 19 23, 19 33. And you could look at all of those, and you could take the worst ten year period and you'd say, ok, so i'm ike right now. I'm 60 seve. In ten years i'll be 77. So if i invest all my money in thesup 500 and don't touch it for a decade, what's the worst thing that could happen? Well, the answer is, something worse than has happened before, possibly. And that that is a possibility is so hard to remember for most people. Cous really, really smart people make that mistake all the time. S that's a simple thing that i've learnt from him. That on osnot like dramatic. I'll give you one more. One of my favorites is an economist. So he has a book called skin in the game.

	- Was I Really Connected to Something?
	  
	  Summary:
	  i remember just, i kept turning my head. constellations and stars out the horizon. I felt connected to something. Allan lihtman, the physicist, has a wonderful book on this. He's an atheist, but he talks about lying in a boat, looking up at the stars, and how you feel something,. It bothers him as a physicist. And he writes about this discomfort that he feels he's something transcendent, there, something bigger than himself.

	  Speaker 1
	  Constellations and stars out the horizon. I mean, i guess me goose bumps to think about it, to talk about it. It was some i don't remember i woke everybody up or even stopped the car. I just it was ltle bit dangerous. I i rolled down the window to get better sight. And i remember just, i kept turning my head. I felt connected to something. Now, was i really connected to something? Anmy imagining it? I don't really care. Actually. I hope it's true that there's something than just nature and the material and my animal self, but there might not be. But i do feel it sometimes. And i think most of us have moments like that. Allan lihtman, the physicist, has a wonderful book on this. He's an atheist, but he talks about lying in a boat, looking up at the stars, and how you feel something, and it bothers him as a physicist. And he writes about this discomfort that he feels he's something transcendent, there, something bigger than himself.

	- How Do You Grow Up?
	  
	  Summary:
	  "As a perfectionist, most of what i do is never up to my standards," he says. "A older friend of mine said long time ago, he you're never as good as they say you are." He's often reminded himself of that in his writing and on the podcast. 'i leakd through the podcast and sometimes through the books'
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  Thank you for saying all that. And for the question, i'll mention a few things. The first is that, and i'm not proud of this, but i am my own best critic or worst enemy, depending on the day, depending on the impact that it has on me, this being my inner voices on my psychology and emotional state and so on. But i do think that as a perfectionist, most of what i do is never up to my standards, whatever those imaginary standards might be, were as unreachable as they might be. So i think that's one i've certainly been told, and i'm sure this is attributed to some one else originally, but a older friend of mine said long time ago, he you're never as good as they say you are, and you're never as bad as they say you are. And i've often reminded myself of that. I think that i also, i leakd through the podcast and sometimes through the books, even though i haven't written what i would consider a proper book.
