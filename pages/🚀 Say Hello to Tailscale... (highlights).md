	- Tailscale SSH allows you to establish SSH connections between devices in your Tailscale network, as authorized by your access controls, without managing SSH keys, and authenticates your SSH connection using WireGuardÂ®. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Tailscale/status/1539626238536404992))
	- For sensitive high-risk connections, such as those connecting as root, you can also enable check mode. Check mode requires a user to re-authenticate with your SSO (or to have recently re-authenticated) before being able to establish a Tailscale SSH connection. https://t.co/fofeZQf18Q ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Tailscale/status/1539626251098263552))
