	- Tetlock first discovered that some forecasters are more accurate than others thanks to a decades-long study called “Expert Political Judgment” (EPJ). ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/60153d02-a073-4dde-9eea-24160b04b2e8))
	- while researching for the book Good to Great, author Jim Collins and his research team interviewed leaders of companies that vastly outperform other companies in their respective industries ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/705c8ae2-c30a-40e5-abfe-754a37a482e2))
	- strong business leaders should boil down the answers to three questions: What can I do better than anyone else? What is my financial engine? And what am I most passionate about? ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/edc72144-8a2d-47a9-b57a-a61ac2e5a75b))
	- Reverse-engineer the problem. For example, if you’re asked to predict the likelihood of the U.S. raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, pretend it’s already happened and work backwards from there.

	- Broaden your horizons. Commit to reading books and following news sources outside of your comfort zone. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/e70cf92b-36ea-477d-ac03-0b591ade8df6))
	- Try attacking your own conclusions. This is similar to the technique of “negative empiricism” that Nassim Nicholas Taleb describes in The Black Swan, which involves deliberately searching for evidence that will disprove your argument.

	- Most people’s mental “probability dial” has three distinct settings: yes, no, and maybe. By contrast, probabilistic thinkers have an unlimited number of settings. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/85abeb8a-6c7d-417b-83ee-3e62391dedcf))
	- The premortem technique can help you reorient to the outside view because assuming your answer is incorrect will likely force you to recognize that the specifics of this situation aren’t as important as the base rate. For example, if you’re predicting whether a startup will succeed, it’s tempting to take the inside view and make your forecast based on the business model or the founder’s previous business experience. However, if you try a premortem analysis, it will be easy to come up with reasons the company failed given that the failure rate for startups is roughly 90%.

	- Tetlock and Gardner argue that we can get around it by breaking big questions like “Will things turn out okay?” into a host of smaller questions that superforecasters can answer. This is called Bayesian question clustering. The answers to these questions contribute a small piece of the overall answer. Cumulatively, the answers to those small questions can approximate an answer to the bigger question. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/c398b689-d218-49cb-9284-8706e461b007))
	- related to black swan thinking—whatever future events you can predict (metaphorically shine a light on) won’t matter because the only truly important events are, by definition, unpredictable. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/663e810b-1355-4dde-9bf5-52cd3c8f89e7))
