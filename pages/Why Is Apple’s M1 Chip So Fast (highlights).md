- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 18th, 2022]]
	- A CPU at its most basic level is a device with a number of named memory cells called registers and a number of computational units called arithmetic logic units (ALU)
	- One core is basically a full independent chip that can read instructions from memory and perform calculations
	- GPUs in contrast are cool with the waiter being slow to serve the data. But the GPUs want enormous servings. They gobble massive amounts of data because they are massive parallel machines, that can chew through lots of data in parallel.
	- Out-of-Order execution (OoOE) is a way to execute more instructions in parallel but without exposing that capability as multiple threads.
