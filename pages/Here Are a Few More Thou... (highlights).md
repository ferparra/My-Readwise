	- Here are a few more thoughts about documenting software architecture.
	  
	  The original goal of the article was to simply explain why I use PlantUML. 
	  
	  But it’s expanded to cover the several key topics:

	- 1. The software architecture of a computing system is the set of structures needed to reason about the system, which comprise software elements, relations among them, and properties of both. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/crichardson/status/1617922264871100417))
	- 2. Architecture is multi-dimensional -  it's described by a set of views, each of which is a collection of elements, relations and their properties. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/crichardson/status/1617922266758619138))
	- 3. Architecture documentation != diagrams
	  
	  A view's documentation is some combination of diagrams and text. Sometimes, it might be purely textual. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/crichardson/status/1617922269434486784))
	- 4. Documenting dynamic behavior is essential
	  
	  It’s insufficient to merely describe a view’s static structure. You must describe a view’s dynamic behavior, which is how its elements collaborate during a scenario. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/crichardson/status/1617922271284281344))
	- Documenting the dynamic behavior using scenarios (derived from user stories) connects the architectural elements to the requirements - their reason to exist. It's a continuation of the outside in, user-goal driven approach. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/crichardson/status/1617922278238322693))
	- 5. An architecture diagram must clearly communicate.
	  
	  Provided that you remember these five key points, you can use whatever visual notation and tooling that works for you .
