- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- 1. Biological Sequence Analysis by Durbin et al.How to model DNA, RNA and proteins as probabilistic languages / generative models. There is also a companion book with all exercises solved.2. Physical Biology of the Cell by Phillips et al.A massive amount of quantitative cell biology models that use simple undergrad physics.Originated from a Caltech course. After reading this book, all other intro to biology books look like a bag of tricks.3. An Introduction to Systems Biology: Design Principles of Biological Circuits by Alon.Bacterial circuits from the perspective of an electrical engineer.
	- There’s several levels of abstraction just between rna/ribosomes and functional proteins… that’s one of the most shocking complexities to me, most pieces of life are rather elegant when you come to understand them but it’s hard to imagine how complex proteins evolved spontaneously.
	- Consider this question - look outside at a tree. Where did all the carbon in the  tree come from? You may have heard that carbon fixation in plants use a process called "photosynthesis" that involves iron ions. Where did the iron come from? If only we taught by using storytelling techniques and posing questions to students, perhaps we might have more engagement with science than we have today.
