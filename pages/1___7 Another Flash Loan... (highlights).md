	  What was stolen:
	- 3/7
	  
	  Each attack looked like this (using the example of the WBNB pool):
	  
	  1) Flash swap 6k WBNB ($2M) from PancakeSwap
	  
	  2) Swap almost all WBNB to 92k BURGER on BurgerSwap

	- 4/7
	  
	  3) Create pair with a fake token on BurgerSwap and add 100 fake tokens and 45k BURGER
	  
	  4) Swap 100 fake tokens to 4.4k WBNB through the pool from the third step
	  
	  5) Because of reentrancy in time of transfer fake token attacker did another swap from 45k BURGER to 4.4k WBNB

	  The exploit happened because the attacker could do reentrance and did a second swap before reserves, which are used to calculate the number of tokens in swaps, were updated.

	- 7/7
	  
	  The stolen funds are still being sold and withdrawn to Ethereum via the Nerve bridge.
	  
	  There are about $1.7M left on BSC in BURGER and xBURGER.
	  
	  On Ethereum, there are 1.4k ETH ($3.8M) and 1M DAI.
