	- There's a sweet-spot between disagreeable & agreeable—between being independently minded enough to pursue contrarian ideas, but positive-sum enough to collaborate with & not alienate others
	  
	  Highly disagreeable are often cranks; Highly agreeable people rarely go against the grain ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1404850630863114243))

	- Very high-level thoughts on growth:
	- We’re obsessed w/ optionality:
	  
	  “I don't know what I'm gonna do w/ my life so I’m gonna get a degree”
	  
	  “I don’t know what to do w/ this degree so I'm gonna get a grad degree”
	  
	  “I don't know what to do w/ grad degree so I’m gonna get consulting job to figure out what job I want.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1082783328397230080))
	- The average ambitious person spends too much time accumulating optionality & too little time taking actual risk.
	  
	  They compete insanely hard to accumulate options for the future, instead of figuring out what they really want to do & doing that instead.

	- The hardest thing about universities to disrupt is prestige—
	  
	  They’re prestige pyramid schemes, aligned via shared prestige incentives spanning generations
	  
	  Need to move from zero sum prestige factories to p2p credentialing/social capital investing
	  
	  Less ivory tower, more village ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1444493326162403334))
	- The first 10-20 years of ed-tech was about taking education and putting it on the web—we got MOOCs, Masterclass, & online tutors. 
	  
	  The next 10-20 years will be about the web fundamentally changing what we mean by education—We'll get On Deck, Lambda, Pioneer, Interact, CBCs, etc ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1361413606198312965))
	- Ever day, 138,000 people are lifted out of poverty. That's been the trend for the last 25 years.
	  
	  That could have been the headline of every newspaper for the last 25 years. But it isn't because things getting steadily better isn't news. It doesn't spark outrage, it doesn't sell.

	- Elevating others is a super power. 
	  
	  If someone feels that you’ll elevate them in front of others, especially when they’re not present, they’ll be more likely to want to work/affiliate with you—and elevate you in front of others too. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1373804880066965505))
	- Personal trainer, but for intellectual growth:
	  
	  You identify what you want to learn and the trainer tells you what to read, who to follow, & assembles domain specific tutors & peers.
	  
	  We have intellectual equivalent of classes/bootcamps, but not trainers who take a holistic view. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1368313813435523073))
	- When you find a person with a high slope/growth rate—invest in them, hire them, find ways to work with them. 
	  
	  They’re often insatiably curious, relentlessly resourceful, and either have something to prove or are compelled by a greater calling. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1376273784437673989))
	- Found a new favorite philosophy podcast, went to look up where the host did his PhD, & instead found this.
	  
	  I'm endlessly inspired by the idea that people can gain world-class expertise w/o needing approval from traditional gatekeepers, & by the sheer force of will to get there.

	- Reality is up for grabs right now.
	  
	  We're seeing more and more groups bootstrapping their own reality.
	  
	  People call this "community building" but sometimes it's literally people defecting the shared sense of mainstream reality that has existed for centuries and creating new ones ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1302876115548033026))

	  2- "You think you know what you want, but you’re wrong"
	  3- "Be a satisfier, not a maximizer"
