- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- Human behavior isn’t generally helpful in mitigating global risks: In an emergency, people act to preserve their own lives, health, well-being, jobs, and families.
	- People need to see results fast if they’re sacrificing: During the Covid crisis, when lockdowns didn’t stop the virus, that damaged many people’s trust in mitigation efforts.
	- Scientific and technical breakthroughs are our only hope: This has often been the proposed or actual solution to large-scale crises
	- Risk management, on some levels, requires a pessimistic valence: you spend your days wondering what could go wrong. But even more, it requires out-of-the-box optimism, because you spend even more of your days exploring how to mitigate potential problems
