document_note:: In David Foster Wallace's 2005 commencement speech to Kenyon College, he encourages students to fight their "natural default setting" and to choose what they pay attention to and how they construct meaning from experiences. He emphasizes that true freedom is gained through awareness and discipline, and that true education is about understanding how to think and make conscious choices. He advises against worshipping money and things, as they will never be enough and will eventually leave you feeling empty. He encourages people to keep the truth at the forefront of their daily consciousness in order to gain true freedom and real education.
