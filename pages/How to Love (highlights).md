document_note:: In order to truly love another person, one must first accept and love themselves. Love is made up of four elements: loving kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity. These elements must be present in order for a relationship to be a deep one. Intimacy comes in three forms: physical, emotional, and spiritual. True love is based on trust and respect and should not be confused with simply saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù to the other person‚Äôs desires. Love requires understanding, so it is important to practice deep listening, conscious breathing, and meditation in order to understand and connect with oneself and with others. Sexual activity without love is called empty sex, and true partners or friends should encourage each other to look deep inside and embrace the beauty within. Finally, true love should bring well-being to oneself and others and should not create attachment or suffering.
