	- Well, here goes nothin‚Äô! I was asked to open source the career ladders I used for my organization, I hope it‚Äôs a helpful resource for people:

	- It‚Äôs been a year since I was asked to do this. Career ladders aren't enough on their own- it‚Äôs essential to discuss how they work in practice, which is why I wrote an article too.
	  
	  Rubrics without action are pointless because they don‚Äôt actually drive clarity for your employees. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1382703187111636993))
	- The truth is, it‚Äôs not important for an engineering manager (EM) to use my process in particular. It is, however, *very important* that they are clear with their employees about expectations and direction. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1382703267193425921))
	- The purpose of open sourcing them is not to give the impression that this is the one true way, or that they‚Äôre perfect and there's nothing to improve upon. 
	  
	  There is value in sharing them, though, in that many EMs have mentioned to me that they don't know where to start. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1382703360667701259))
	- My hope is that engineering management in general becomes a bit more transparent over time and we try to share more. It‚Äôs always going to be tougher to do so in management but I believe we have a lot to learn from one another.
