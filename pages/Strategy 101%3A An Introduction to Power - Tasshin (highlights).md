	- How can I, or someone else, use work as an opportunity to grow individually?
	- How should I decide which tasks to take on, which projects to prioritize, which goals to set, which problems to solve?
	- Who should I work with? Who makes for a good team member?
	- How should groups of people prioritize what to work towards, and coordinate to accomplish their goals? How should we organize ourselves as a team?
	- How can I coordinate effectively with other organizations?
	- Wardley Maps are good for “things you don’t understand but should.”
	- wise and loving people should have power. Power is morally neutral—used by people who lack wisdom and love, it causes tremendous harm. Used by those who are wise and loving, it can be of tremendous benefit.
	- “maximum deep benefit”: helping as many people as possible, as deeply as possible
	- Cynefin (pronounced like “kenevin”) is the Welsh word for “habitat.”
	- Disorder is when you don’t know what kind of problem you have.
	- Obvious problems have simple, well-known solutions. Being hungry means you should eat some food.
	- Complicated problems have known solutions that aren’t easy.
	- Complex problems don’t have well-known solutions, but are subject to the laws of cause and effect. Do several easy, cheap, safe-to-fail experiments.
	- Chaotic problems have no known solutions and don’t obey the normal laws of cause and effect. This is a highly unstable environment, and any action is better than inaction.
	- OODA is an acronym for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. This can be as simple as cycling through these steps, but these simple elements can become much more complex.
	- The best laid plans often prove to be shiny, brittle failures.
	- Be willing to adapt: to add, drop goals on the fly, and totally rearrange circumstances. Be aware of what things – skills, relationships, internal efforts etc – you can count on being valuable even if you don’t know how in advance.
	- Mastering standard operating procedure is table stakes for competition. Competitors who also have a flair for the dramatic and unexpected will consistently beat those who merely do what is standard practice.
	- Having a visual artifact handy, even a very rough one, simplifies group decision-making dramatically.
	- Burja Maps help you to interpret the current power landscape, and decide how to move forward.
	- The Theory of Constraints posits that every system has a constraint.
