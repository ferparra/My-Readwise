document_note:: This text discusses how we can address existential entrapment by cultivating gnosis, which is enabled by a capacity for higher states of consciousness. It is suggested that this can be explained by our best cognitive science, and is ultimately about a kind of deep connectedness. This deep connectedness is found in the affordances co-created by the world in ourselves, and is termed agape. The 4E's of cognitive science are discussed, including embodiment, embeddedness, relevance realization, and emotions. It is argued that the mind arises out of a living environment and that it is important to understand the mind in terms of how it excels beyond the norm. Finally, it is suggested that this brings with it a new sense of transcendence into the depths of nature and the psyche, which can lead to transformative development.
