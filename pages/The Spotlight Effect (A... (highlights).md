	- There are two big mistakes in life:
	  
	  1. Worrying about what other people think about you.

	  This is liberating—stop worrying about what others think, be yourself, and live according to your values. https://t.co/CRd1bXLHmH ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1655964772679004161))
	- Basically, the Spotlight Effect says we think people care about us WAY MORE than they actually do.
	  
	  I used to worry about every little thing I did, thinking that people would scrutinize or judge me.
	  
	  This places a huge and unnecessary drag on growth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1656040624649322505))
