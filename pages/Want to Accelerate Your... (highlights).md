	- What do Buffett, Musk, & Bezos have in common (besides $$$)?
	  
	  They know powerful writing isn't an accident‚Äîclear writing is clear thinking.
	  
	  The principles of great business writing:
	  ‚Ä¢ Draft Fast, Edit Slow
	  ‚Ä¢ KISS
	  ‚Ä¢ Clear Target Reaction
	  ‚Ä¢ Storytelling
	  
	  Let's cover each: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1459531955616325636))
	- Principle 1: Draft Fast, Edit Slow
	  
	  There's nothing more daunting than a blank page.
	  
	  So start fast‚Äîget a draft down (and don‚Äôt fret if it sucks).
	  
	  My friend @Julian said it best: ‚ÄúMaking something bad then iterating until it‚Äôs good is faster than making something good upfront.‚Äù ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1459531956887203843))
	- My "Write-Rest-Review" framework:
	  
	  Get the first draft down as quickly as possible.
	  
	  Walk away for 5 minutes‚Äîgo for a walk, grab a coffee, whatever.
	  
	  Come back and review it.
	  
	  What's missing? Where are the logical flaws?
	  
	  When you review with "new" eyes, good things happen. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1459531958258700292))
	- Principle 2: Keep It Simple, Stupid
	  
	  Most people assume that longer, more complex writing will impress and inspire.
	  
	  It doesn't.
	  
	  Great business writing is simple and direct. There's no fluff or handwaving‚Äîit's tactical.
	  
	  A few actionable tips to tighten and simplify: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1459531960083226625))
	- Cut the Fluff
	  
	  In school, we were taught to heap descriptors into our writing‚Äîwe were told it made it more vibrant.
	  
	  (It also helped fill out the word or page count we were forced to hit!)
	  
	  In the real world, those fluff words are assassins of punchy, powerful business writing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1459531961261776896))
	- Review your draft with an eye towards removing any unnecessary words & sentences.
	  
	  Some common fluff:
	  ‚Ä¢ "I think X"
	  ‚Ä¢ "very" (or similar adverbs)
	  ‚Ä¢ Acronyms
	  ‚Ä¢ Jargon
	  ‚Ä¢ $10 words (fancy for no reason)
	  
	  Be ruthless in identifying and eliminating the fluff words & sentences. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1459531962452955138))
	- Shorten Everything
	  
	  Powerful business writing is very similar to powerful Twitter writing.
	  
	  Shorter is better.
	  
	  Use short sentence structures.
	  
	  Space sentences or paragraphs out to make the writing more optically pleasing.
	  
	  Great business writing should be engaging to the eye. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1459531963614871554))
	- Add Data
	  
	  This is a classic principle instilled by @JeffBezos in Amazon's writing-centric culture.
	  
	  Replace fluff words with data.
	  
	  Before: "The majority of viewers loved the show."
	  
	  After: "95% of viewers rated the show with 5-stars."
	  
	  Clear & much more impactful. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1459531964806012937))
	- Principle 3: Clear Target Reaction
	  
	  Great business writing has a clear target reaction‚Äîa deliberate purpose or aim.
	  
	  That target reaction should be experienced by the reader immediately.
	  
	  As my friend @SamParr says: "Punch the reader in the face with your first sentence." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1459531966206951426))
	- Amazon calls it the "so what?" test.
	  
	  Before you share any piece of business writing, identify the "so what?" of the piece.
	  
	  What reaction, value, or takeaway should the audience have?
	  
	  Is it coming across loud and clear?
	  
	  If not, go back to the drawing board and punch harder. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1459531967389704193))
	- Principle 4: Storytelling
	  
	  Storytelling is a foundational skill‚Äîbut it's one we don‚Äôt learn in the traditional education system.
	  
	  It's no coincidence that the greatest CEOs & founders are the greatest storytellers.
	  
	  High-leverage storytelling is a supercharger for all endeavors. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1459531969033822210))
	- Humans are storytelling creatures‚Äîwe developed around campfires. Lean into it.
	  
	  Adding a story to a memo on a dry topic can bring the entire piece to life. Simple, crisp stories enhance the power of the message.
	  
	  Here's a thread I wrote on principles of effective storytelling: https://t.co/xOfxIcSidi ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1459531970120241157))
	- A few ideas (without contradicting the KISS principle):
	  
	  Add a mini anecdote to illustrate a point.
	  
	  Use a folksy one-liner to draw people in (Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are the MASTERS of this).
	  
	  A storytelling touch will make your writing punch well above its weight. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1459531971919499270))
	- Better business writing can change your life.
	  
	  To summarize, the key principles:
	  ‚Ä¢ Draft Fast, Edit Slow
	  ‚Ä¢ KISS
	  ‚Ä¢ Clear Target Reaction
	  ‚Ä¢ Storytelling
	  
	  Start using these and I guarantee you will see improvement.
