	- I was the PM on point for the launch of the original 
	  @AmazonKindle
	   Fire tablet a decade ago, and today I want to share one of the many war stories I collected from that experience 
	  
	  a Ôøºüßµ on how Amazon leverages compound interest in decision making ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624642774330118144))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- First, let us hear from famous ex-Amazonian Albert Einstein:
	  
	  ‚ÄúCompound interest¬†is the 8th¬†wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it.‚Äù ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624642841560629255))
	- There are 2 takeaways from this, product-wise:
	  
	  1/ you can layer product choices over time to compound value
	  
	  2/ you can exacerbate product debt over time by carrying it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624642892433342465))
	- If you spend enough time at Amazon, you start to to build this pattern-matching / decision-making muscle. And occasionally you get to flex. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624642987379810304))
	- When I was working on the original Fire tablet as a PM in the Kindle org, the execs would do weekly reviews with Jeff (Bezos) and I‚Äôd get forwarded notes to decipher. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624643036797108225))
	- One throwaway comment I read early on was ‚ÄúJeff thinks everyone that buys the tablet gets Prime‚Äù, and with all Jeff ideas it‚Äôs worth understanding‚Ä¶why? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624643336329105408))
	- So I ambled over to the desk (pre COVID / remote work era) where the Kindle SVP / VPs sat and just asked one of them‚Ä¶why? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624643391651979266))
	- Here was the story:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢you buy the tablet (not an e-reader) and you expect a kick-ass video experience
	  
	  ‚Ä¢we were already planning to put a version of our Android video app on the Fire
	  
	  ‚Ä¢the concern was the OOBE* (out of the box experience) on the video tab because (contd) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624643566185353219))
	- -you probably would have no content in your purchased / rental library to view but
	  
	  -there was a deal being worked on with studios to create a video library for Prime (contd) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624643836017508352))
	- so, let‚Äôs ‚Äúgrant‚Äù a (time-boxed) Prime subscription to everyone who buys the Fire
	- The ambition was mind-boggling. Kindles till that point had been a gateway to selling more books, with the average Kindle owner being a 10x reader. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624644094772514817))
	- But with the Fire tablet:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢you start to sell more types of long-form content (comics, textbooks, audiobooks)
	  ‚Ä¢you create a more compelling visual experience for a slice of content (magazines)
	  ‚Ä¢(contd) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624644404672888832))
	- ‚Ä¢you are able to sell your existing digital media (music, video) via another channel
	  ‚Ä¢you are creating a new subscriber funnel for a very lucrative service (Prime**) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624644489800486912))
	- It was like a flywheel, within a flywheel, kickstarting another flywheel. 
	  
	  And we had to get the CX right. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624644648278044672))
	- I sought out the PM on point and asked to understand the gameplan. The MVP was apparently to get a list of Kindle buyer emails, then send a subset an offer to sign up for Prime.
	  
	  What?!? No‚Ä¶ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624644704645304322))
	- So, I put on my (unofficial) Customer Experience Bar Raiser (CXBR) hat and redefined it.
	  
	  Note: CXBR‚Äôs are like Amazon‚Äôs version of the Pixar Brain Trust ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624644962158788608))
	- What was my improved CX pitch?
	  
	  1you auto-magically get a Prime subscription when you buy the Kindle Fire
	  2unlike every Prime plan (e.g. student, mom) you don‚Äôt enter credit card (friction)
	  330 days later you get a letter on your Kindle explaining expiration / subscription ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624645015996870656))
	- Here‚Äôs what that meant in practice:
	  
	  1the Subscriptions Service PM had to get on board with ‚Äúgranting‚Äù (vs buying)
	  2the Prime Offers PM had to get on board with a plan w/o payment (blasphemy)
	  3the Kindle Campaigns PM had to get on board with non-Kindle messaging (huh?) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624645072095690752))
	- What authorized / qualified me to take things back to the drawing board? 
	  
	  As I said in my recent post* :
	  
	  ‚Äúyou can make any decision with a cogent plan for why/how‚Äù
	  
	  * here -> https://t.co/CbcFkNw0yq ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624645354707906560))
	- So let‚Äôs talk about the how, and this is where the compounding value of product decisions comes in. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624645476728606721))
	- We had a service in place to trigger actions based on events (e.g. purchase event -> welcome email). The quick (&functional) solution was to hack this up to talk to Prime service, b/c Jeff‚Äôs ask was explicitly ‚Äúeveryone that buys the tablet gets Prime‚Äù, & this met the requirement ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624645541526405121))
	- But there was a pattern here.
	  
	  Were we giving temporary Prime without payment to Kindle buyers? Or were we granting digital benefits with deferred purchase for physical orders? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624645595058307072))
	- With a higher-leverage architecture, setup for scale, and some incremental effort, we could build the latter. There was no specific use case to prioritize a more foundational solution, but I made the call anyway. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624645728797859841))
	- Hindsight is 20/20, so when I go over this story in my head now, I honestly don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶
	  
	  1Was it foresight? (unlikely, although it will read like it)
	  2Was it instinct? (not really, although it sounds very cool)
	  3Was it culture? (probably, I‚Äôd internalized this from others) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624645800478519301))
	- All this solutioning happened in the early days of the product, but a few weeks before launch 3 crazy things happened in succession‚Ä¶ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624645858234109953))
	- 1/ the music team asked if there was a way to nudge customers to download their MP3 library to their Kindle tablet (music was the 1st type of digital content Amazon sold, even before e-books, and many customers had huge libraries) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624645929822461953))
	- 2/ the appstore team showed up in a panic, saying Jeff wanted to give away the app of the day for free to a device buyer as a promotion option for game developers ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624645983811534849))
	- 3/ the Prime video library idea had been expanded from studios to publishers, and now a book library was possible in addition to a video library ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624646109405773825))
	- All 3 ideas, which would create a delightful experience and insane buzz, needed some sort of generic digital benefit entitlement service. Was there such a thing? At scale?
	  
	  What?!? Yes‚Ä¶ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624646163252264960))
	- By layering your product choices and thinking long-term, you can build up to moments of immense pay-off in terms of customer value. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624646214959652864))
	- I‚Äôll leave you with a quote (from Algorithms to Live By) and a request to hear about your own experience with decisions compounding in serendipitous ways‚Ä¶ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ibscribe/status/1624646306261237761))
