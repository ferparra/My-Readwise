	- 1. Rivers
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ River banks are + fertile‚û°Ô∏è+food‚û°Ô∏è+ppl
	  ‚Ä¢ +ppl‚û°Ô∏è+specialization‚û°Ô∏è+wealth
	  ‚Ä¢ +ppl‚û°Ô∏è+military to control the region
	  ‚Ä¢ Cheaper transport‚û°Ô∏è+trade‚û°Ô∏è+wealth
	  
	  Good locations on rivers became trade & administration centers that controlled their hinterland

	- 2. Confluences
	  The best cities were at the ùó∞ùóºùóªùó≥ùóπùòÇùó≤ùóªùó∞ùó≤ of rivers: They could trade the products from each branch.
	  
	  They could also control & administrate these regions
	  
	  Notice pop density in üá´üá∑: It follows rivers, with big hubs at their confluence

	- 3. Coasts
	  A city on the coast can trade with every other port on the sea.
	  
	  The best ports are at the intersection of rivers and coasts, to trade the products from the river valley with those from the sea

	- Notice how many wealthy cities in Northern Europe are on a river, close to the sea. The same is true for every port city in the US: NY, Boston, New Orleans, SF...

	- 4. Fall Lines
	  Key points on a river are:
	  ‚Ä¢ Its confluences
	  ‚Ä¢ Its end (coast)
	  ‚Ä¢ But also its beginning: the farthest navigable point upriver. These are called Heads of Navigation, and can trade everything from the hill / mountain region beyond

	- Except that many times these heads of navigation fall on a line‚Äîthe Fall Line

	- The borders btw mountains & plains frequently follow lines called "fall lines", given the local geology
	  
	  Mountains & hills have rocks & rapid waters that can't be navigated. The moment water passes the fall line, it slows down & rivers are navigable.
	  
	  Markets appear there

	- Look at this line of lights in the US East, highlighted in red? These are a string of cities that follow a fall line. https://t.co/GchBgjZvmZ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1607533056000131079))
	- 5. Roads
	  The US connected all these cities with a road, the interstate I-95, further increasing the value of these heads of navigation and cementing their power. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1607533058445508611))
	- The same was true 2000 years ago. The Romans built the Via Aemilia road on a fall line, and the cities along the way stand to this day

	- But you don't need roads to always espouse fall lines. Wherever they are built, they connect cities and form lasting trade axes & trade hubs
	  
	  You can see this in Mexico: The biggest cities follow the ancient Camino Real to the silver mines

	- Today's roads and cities in Spain are approximately the same as in Roman times.
	  
	  Road intersections, like river intersections, have a lasting impact. https://t.co/wwB1coBSFr ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1607533065471143937))
	- A paper recently illustrated the lasting power of infrastructure: Regions near Roman roads, built 2,000 years ago, are wealthier today than other regions.

	- 6. Railroads
	  Like roads, railroads have a similar effect. Look at the trans-Siberian.
	  
	  Night lights (cities) across its length, and very little outside. The main cities are at the crossing btw the railroad and the rivers https://t.co/JZvYYG1ADQ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1607534530574929921))
	- Chicago was 1st on a coast / river line (the Great Lakes), but then used that advantage to build railroad infrastructure, become a railroad hub, & cement its leadership. Lines beget infrastructure, which beget lines.

	- You can see the cities that thrive‚Äîthose at the intersection of as many lines as possible: rivers, coast, fall lines, roads, railroads... The + lines crossed, the bigger the market, the + network effects, and the + historic growth 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fk8cddJX0AAs8VW.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1607534982372954112))
	- The bigger the hub, the + infrastructure investment it received, further improving its trade potential and cementing its lead, from roads and railroads, to river embankments or irrigation systems. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1607536195986403328))
	- Historically, there were some other factors. Rivers, yes. But on a defensible position. Eg, Paris' √éle de la Cit√©, or the hills from London¬¥s City, Athens, Rome...

	- Another was the proximity to a special resource. Eg, Northern England has many big cities thanks to the proximity to coal & iron (fall lines, roads, and then railroads, but no coasts or rivers)

	- And today, there's airports. A city like Dubai would have been impossible a few decades back.
	  
	  Airports are like coastal ports: Having one gives you access to all the other airports. Except you don't need to be on any line to build one.

	- So this is why some cities thrive and not others: The ones at the intersection of the most lines:
	  ‚Ä¢ Rivers
	  ‚Ä¢ Coasts
	  ‚Ä¢ Fall Lines
	  ‚Ä¢ Roads
	  ‚Ä¢ Railways
	  
	  Plus those with
	  ‚Ä¢ A defensible position
	  ‚Ä¢ Valuable local resources
	  ‚Ä¢ Airports now
