	- Lately, we have seen quite a lot of FUD and sell pressure around $OHM.
	  
	  Since market corrections are perfect to reassess investment thesis (to either cut losses or build further conviction). I decided to answer some of the most usual questions that I see on CT.
	  
	  Long thread ðŸ‘‡ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591488103763972))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Most lie under these topics:
	  1. Where does $OHM's value come from?
	  2. Why is @OlympusDAO different from a fund with social asset WL?
	  3. Why should I pay a premium rather than purchase at Treasury Value (NAV)?
	  4. Why should I invest in @OlympusDAO if other forks have higher APY? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591489957650435))
	- "1. Where does $OHM's value come from?"
	  
	  $OHM's value is sustained by several mechanisms. Answering the questions above I aim to showcase the ones that come to my mind.
	  
	  To begin with, I will start with the most obvious ones, the economic drivers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591491908046851))
	- @OlympusDAO acquires economic value from 3 main activities:
	  
	  1.1  Selling bonds.
	  1.2  Acquiring trading fees.
	  1.3  Selling bonds on behalf of the Olympus Pro partners (and taking a small fee from each sale). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591493665497094))
	- Here, it is key to understand that despite bond sales are the main source of revenue, they lead to staker dilution (see @pottedmeat_ohm's fig).
	  
	  Because of that, the DAO aims to slowly increase the importance that trading fees and OP fees have as revenue streams.

	- But how are the non-dilutionary streams of revenue growing? Easy answer.
	- Sidenote: Save this argument for when we discuss the forks.
	  
	  I won't bring it up again, but you should take into account which role dilution plays, and which streams of revenue each project has. Because remember that during downward movements bond revenue diminishes considerably. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591505493344264))
	- Ok, people convinced you that Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) is good, but "2. Why is Olympus different from a fund with social asset WL?"
	  
	  At the time of writing, Olympus Treasury seats at  $810M out of which $500M are liquidity.
	  
	  https://t.co/DqBQF4Ffj1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591507259199492))
	- Based on what we have just seen in the streams of revenue section, we know that 64% of the treasury is productive by definition.
	  
	  But the treasury also holds other assets (stables and ETH mainly), that are not productive by definition, but that can be used to farm rewards. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591509364690949))
	- On top of that, the treasury (via bonds, rewards, and OP fees) and the DAO (via DAO swaps) are also acquiring strategic assets such as $CVX, $TOKE, $CRV, or $FXS.
	  
	  These assets aim to leverage our current liquidity and help accelerate $OHM's establishment as a base currency. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591511067676679))
	- So despite "only having" $500M in POL, each $OHM will be able to control even more liquidity thanks to these strategic assets held by the Treasury (2% of $CVX's Total Supply) and the DAO (1.5% of $TOKE's Circulating Supply). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591512778944515))
	- Ok, now you know that Olympus has different sources of income, that POL earns trading fees + farming rewards + also allows external liquidity direction/control.
	  
	  Nevertheless, you still wonder "3. Why should I pay a premium rather than purchase at Treasury Value (NAV)?" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591514637025285))
	- First of all, I have to admit that purchasing $OHM at Treasury Market Value is a really good deal. I wish I could do it now!
	  
	  The problem is that we are not the only investors, and other people know that the Olympus ecosystem has huge growth potential (which creates a premium). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591516398534669))
	- $OHM has historically traded between 3x-8x its Treasury Market Value. This clearly showcases how the market perceives $OHM and its premium. Let's try to find out the key factors that explain this behavior.
	  
	  Sidenote: Right now $OHM is trading at ~3.75x (bottom may be close? ðŸ¤”)

	- I have already described some of the economic incentives for this premium (POL + constant and diverse revenue streams). Yet another economic incentive is the runway.
	  
	  Investors are aware that Olympus can provide a sustained yield for a long time (> 1 year), and that is valuable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591522618748930))
	- Note that this yield is guaranteed assuming protocol revenue suddenly stops (it is highly unlikely since we have other revenue sources beyond bonds).
	  
	  One more factor that creates this premium is the governance power that $OHM has by holding the before mentioned strategic assets. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591524397133836))
	- Two other factors that IMO are priced in the monetary premium, are partnerships and utilization.
	  
	  Olympus was born 8 months ago, and since then has built a lot of interesting partnerships such as @fraxfinance, @LiquityProtocol, @TokenReactor or any of the Olympus Pro Partners. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591526066413570))
	- We can also see protocols such as @KlimaDAO which decided to use Olympus' model for their own purposes and that decided to give Olympus a share of their supply. Becoming a powerful partner that can onboard new people into the Olympus ecosystem. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591527769354246))
	- Apart from partnerships, lately, we are starting to see $OHM utilization and adoption:
	- Protocols such as @Abachi_io, @LobisHQ,  @redactedcartel, or @ConcaveFi have started building on top of @OlympusDAO.
	- Finally, one of the most important things behind the premium is @OlympusDAO team.
	  
	  The DAO is full of talent and energy. The contributor count is growing every month. It currently sits at 121 contributors, with a steady growth rate. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FGFol9qXsAcDdOQ.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591538540355584))
	- The DAO is well organized, with a lot of teams and subteams focused on their areas of expertise. With plenty of cooperation and always striving for high-quality products.
	  
	  These teams have shipped countless initiatives such as OlympusPro, Tyche, the Olympus Incubator, or OlyZaps. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591540658491392))
	- On top of that, the protocol mission and the long-term vision are always taken into account while taking decisions. The DAO is always trying to build the best possible roadmap with the community's approval (all the initiatives go through a forum post + snapshot vote). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591542315237384))
	- Regarding the team, I just want to add that if you like challenges and working with gigabrains such as @ishaheen10, @sh4dowlegend, @abipup_33, @WartuII, @0xGlue, @J_Fry_4, @mysselium or @0xJala (to name some of them), you should definitely join the DAO.

	- If you have made it so far, I am quite sure that you can answer "4. Why should I invest in @OlympusDAO if other forks have higher APY?" by yourself.
	  
	  Nevertheless, if you still have doubts, I just want you to take into account 2 key things.
	  
	  PS: None of this is investment advice. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591545888694276))
	- The reason why @OlympusDAO was created goes way beyond pump-and-dumbs or quick money grabs. What Olympus aims to build is the decentralized bank of web3.
	  
	  When comparing Olympus with these forks take into account which is the end-game of each project and if it resonates with you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591776529272848))
	- Finally, I can only say that you should always DYOR. I've seen plenty of people comparing Olympus and its forks by only looking at the MC and Treasury Value.
	  
	  Not saying that these comparisons are bad, but check the data/calculations first. Look for other metrics if necessary. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xRusowsky/status/1468591778030882817))
	- Check the reported supplies.
	- In my personal opinion, none of the forks can compete with @OlympusDAO long term. I believe that the human capital and the protocol mechanics/integrations are superior.
	  
	  If you focus short term, I think that you can still benefit by taking into account the exposed arguments.
