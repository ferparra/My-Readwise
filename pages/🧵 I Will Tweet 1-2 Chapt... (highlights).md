	- ðŸ†• Learning to wield an invisible power: an introduction to meta-rationality.
	  
	  You may find this book exciting ifâ€¦
	  
	  https://t.co/nQsESHaFXd https://t.co/0CIMlaDM5c
	- ðŸ†• "Trueâ€”in what sense?" is a first step toward a more sophisticated understanding than both rationalist absolutism and anti-rationalist relativism.
	  
	  https://t.co/GmEkkLd8AQ
	- ðŸ†• Formal systems are crisp; reality is mushy. How does technical rationality bridge this mismatch?
	  
	  https://t.co/QD8HwhaG70
	- ðŸ†• Meta-rational reforms of institutions, and of society and culture at large, can address the breakdown into incoherent ineffectiveness we experience now. https://t.co/uDY6qKXLjW https://t.co/CWlyxCDNEh
	- ðŸ†• From inside any technical system, the answer to trouble of any kind is "do more of the same thing we know how to do." Recognizing that the system just can't work in some situations requires stepping outside it. https://t.co/qcBITzAfhN https://t.co/FcIeviswnh
	- ðŸ†• Logical positivism was the last serious attempt at rationalism. There was no reason, at the outset, to think it would not work.
	  
	  Present-day attempts to understand rationality face the same issues, so we must understand why it definitively failed.
	  
	  https://t.co/0YKy0jnj3m
	- ðŸ†• The oldest, simplest theory says you have a list of sentences in your head. Each is labeled with whether you believe it is true or false. Separately, each is actually true or false in the world.
	  
	  But... https://t.co/88oWjq3oF1 https://t.co/0NvVDW2bRe
	- ðŸ†• Rationally speaking, you can't believe sentences, because you can't even tell what they mean.
	  
	  âˆ€ and âˆƒ to the rescue!
	  
	  https://t.co/PqdnuvWKwB https://t.co/ZBAJESrAJS
	- ðŸ†• Recognizing that statements may be neither true nor false, but meaninglessâ€”thereby rejecting the Law of the Excluded Middle from traditional logicâ€”was a major breakthrough for rationalism a century ago. https://t.co/2DvmfeyOhd https://t.co/QcrlVbp3xk
	- ðŸ†• Even in hard science, most truths are only "pretty much" true. Part I of The Eggplant explains why that causes trouble for rationalism (an inadequate theory of rationality). Part III explains how we make "pretty much" truths worth. https://t.co/J1WkUiU5vG https://t.co/I4hwpwg7Bj
	- ðŸ†• Reductionism: the delightful dream that someday we could prove, beyond any possibility of doubt, that eggplants are fruits. https://t.co/CawKncdxyN https://t.co/gu9cSYDIzj
	- ðŸ†• "We have had more than a century of experience with this, and it has not gone well." https://t.co/9opx5ZTquM
	- ðŸ†• Sometimes it's useful to treat nebulosityâ€”the pervasive fuzziness of thingsâ€”quantitatively: rethinking category judgements as matters of degree, rather than of type.
	  
	  Sometimes it isn't. https://t.co/S57dxSnyhw https://t.co/Plc8svlMJu
	- ðŸ†• Some sorts of nebulosity can reasoned about effectively in terms of approximation, and "all models are false, but some are useful."
	  
	  Some other sorts of nebulosity don't work that way. https://t.co/vPWL2rilHp https://t.co/7t2e9UTSgd
	- ðŸ†• There are no absolute truths about an eggplant-sized object, because there is no absolute truth about which atoms make it up. https://t.co/ZPsBgV926T https://t.co/EJV6Llw2i6
	- ðŸ†• Oddly enough, it was the most hardcore rationalist philosophers of science who declared that scientific discovery is necessarily irrational and therefore cannot be studied. All we can do, they said, is explain why we should believe now. https://t.co/cx07mdOs6j https://t.co/h0HSJkXMLQ
	- Scientific discovery is not irrational; it is meta-rational.
	  
	  The science credibility crisis is driving reflection on how we do that. The last part of this paper (h/t @NeuroStats) is excellent.
	  
	  Tukeyâ€™s EDA is a primo example of meta-rational methodology
