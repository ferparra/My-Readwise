	- Okay my loves, time for another sleep-deprived thread. Last one was the IPCC 'summary for policymakers'; this'll cover the 'technical summary' as we read through it together; particularly highlight bits that weren't in the SPM!

		- **Note**: Thread
	- It's barely present in the SPM, but surprisingly prominent in the 'technical summary' - power dynamics exist in the gap between big promises and the absence of action, on climate.

	- This huge table is just a stunning emotional rollercoaster. 
	  
	  "Here's a good thing!"
	  
	  "ACTUALLY IT'S NO GOOD"
	  
	  aggghhh

	- Emissions growth slowed / ACTUALLY STILL GOING UP
	- ^^ obviously none of that is all that surprising and it's definitely a good, accurate summary of where we're at. It's just...........you constantly have to eat your damn vegetables in this climate space and it's exhausting. This is y so many big climate accounts fly off the rails ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511480857579511808))
	- Can we adopt this phrase, instead of 'net zero'?

	- Such a neat summary of the good / bad aspects of net zero frameworks - for countries, but applies to corps as well I'd argue

	- It is so refreshing to see this in an IPCC report. 
	  
	  "Accurate transference of the climate science has been undermined significantly by climate change counter- movements, in both legacy and new/social media environments through misinformation"
	  
	  That's you, @newscorpaus :)

	- @newscorpaus "emerging evidence since AR5 indicates that small-scale technologies (e.g., solar, batteries) tend to improve faster and be adopted more quickly than large-scale technologies (nuclear, CCS)"

	- THIS ONE'S IMPORTANT
	  
	  You need to
	- Lots of people are promising good things for 2050, but no one is really doing enough before 2030. 
	  
	  That is a HUGE problem, and points to a systemic problem where promises are more important than actions.

	- Seen all of the stuff from people Very Seriously reminding everyone that the report says "we need" carbon removal? 
	  
	  As so many of us have pointed out here before: THAT'S BECAUSE WE FAILED - AND ARE FAILING - TO REDUCE EMISSIONS ASAP TODAY. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPnnDowVcAQ_tX9.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511493382278766600))
	- Here's the thing, everyone: we should be aggressively working to make the situation such that we do not need to rely on carbon removal as much as our current fail-plans suggest we'll need to. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511493624973783041))
	- But....how to close the gaps here? 
	  
	  "Underlying structural features of society" can be blocks. And if they're blocks: they need to CHANGE.
	  
	  "Meeting ambitious mitigation and development goals cannot be achieved through incremental change" - in an IPCC report!!

	- The terminology is confusing here, so....here's an explanation 
	  #IPCC 
	  
	  "Emissions gap" -> the space between what's promised, and what's needed for climate goals
	  
	  "Implementation gap" -> the space between what's been made real through policy, and what's promised

	- A weirdly-hard-to-look-at-but-still-quite-informative graphic on just transition plans across the world. Australia's LaTrobe Valley Authority gets a mention.

	- Just.....don't forget the highlighted text here, folks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPn3_VVVcAoZizr.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511512558963879937))
	- Our current policies globally put us on a pathway to definitely breaching 1.5C and probably breaching 2C. 
	  
	  Shitty 2030 targets = "oh WELL we have to rely on carbon removal now; if only there were some way we could have prevented needing this" 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPn5PvbUcAMv_Ar.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511514418726662150))
	- If we refuse to update our collectively awful 2030 targets, then we need to reduce emissions **70% FASTER AFTER 2030** compared to if we start acting now. 
	  
	  That is: we need to replicate COVID19 emissions drop rate after 2030, if we delay action until 2030! 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPn6nWwUYAIvFmw.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511515131645112324))
	- The red line here = 'current policies'. 
	  
	  The powerful decision makers are deciding to doom the rest of us.

	- "net zero by 2050" is an average. 
	  
	  If you delay emissions reduction today, you need to reach zero sooner. If you act quickly today, you can reach zero later.

	- "As a general rule, and across all sectors, it is more efficient to use electricity directly and avoid the progressively larger conversion losses from producing hydrogen, ammonia, or constructed low GHG hydrocarbons"
	- "There are growing concerns about resource availability, labour rights, non-climate environmental impacts, and costs of critical minerals needed for lithium-ion batteries"
	  
	  Yep - part of the reason why we ought to minimise the # of new-build vehicles as much as possible

	- This nicely illustrates what a few other folks, eg @amywestervelt, @NiranjanAjit, et al have pointed out. The ideas outlined in this report are.......really good? ???
	  
	  Eg: absolute reductions in energy demand, rather than just efficiency improvements that get eaten up by growth

	- Jeez, look at the size of Australia's per-capita food system GHG intensity. High meat exports is a big part of that I imagine 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPoRjRbVQAIIM5i.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511540311050244096))
	- This is confusing AF but **REALLY** important.
	  
	  CCS CCU -> You capture the carbon as you cause its release ('point source capture', eg a power plant)
	  
	  Carbon removal -> You pluck that carbon from the air and put it somewhere else (underground, in trees/soils, in the sea) 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPoSrb5VsAYOMz-.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511541612563771401))
	- WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT
	  
	  If you capture the carbon as you cause it, you make **no difference** to the air (meh)
	  
	  If you capture the carbon just straight from the air, you **have a negative impact** on the stock of carbon in the air (quite good if you store it underground forever) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511542218196086785))
	- Great, big, detailed summary table of carbon removal options, risks, co-benefits etc. Bookmark this one folks, it's vital

	- Welcome back to the Twitter summary of the technical summary. We're 101 pages through a 145 summary of a ~3,000 page report :) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511579910669623296))
	- This section's on demand-side options and it's SO FASCINATING. This idea of focusing on service rather than just 'lots of energy = gooood' is really counter to the views of many climate folks; who ironically are the ones who insist for 'all of the above' approaches. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPo2YeJUcAUPmp-.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511580661970182145))
	- Why IPCC WG3 is so much noticeably better than previous ones - they're including the best social science when it comes to demand and mitigation! 
	  
	  This leads to better, more efficient, smarter and more beneficial climate policies, of course! 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPo3DpoVcAQxRaL.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511581332446478338))
	- The sheer scale of emissions reductions that occur from demand-side actions is really quite something. Food, land transport and buildings in particular get reduced a lot due to socio-cultural, infrastructure and technology changes!! 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPo38qwVIAUTNsx.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511582471090946048))
	- How about this bit in the Technical Summary
	  
	  Corporates deflect responsibility and "appropriate climate care sentiments into their own brand-building" - that is, greenwashing!

	- this is only five lines but, er, it's the main engine of both successful and failed mitigation over the past five decades SO

	- "The media shapes the public discourse about climate mitigation"
	  
	  It's so significant to me that this report has been somewhat underreported, considering that the media itself features in its considerations.... 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPo8PLKVsAIOupA.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511586914410721282))
	- I think this is true but it's worth noting that this happened for Australia's carbon pricing scheme - to the extent where taxpayers were *better off* under the scheme than before - and it still got wrecked subject to an aggressive media and political campaign. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPo8bUAVsAITuu6.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511587400962633728))
	- This, like the IEA's NZE report, shies away from explicitly calling for an end to fossil fuel subsidies, instead presenting it as a generally nice and cool thing to do, rather than an urgent need (like how it presents carbon removal) 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPo9C0CVgAAsrC6.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511587811773726721))
	- This is buried right in the back-end of TS but it's also really important.
	  
	  Did you know that if you implement climate policies, you avoid the emissions of greenhouse gases? Yes, this is something we know is happening. Not enough, and not fast enough, but it *works*

	- As @KendraWrites kept telling Jon Stewart in that interview: getting marginalised people access to political participation = more climate action 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPo-9_VVQAcq-hg.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511590090383892484))
	- @KendraWrites "Changing from a commercialised, individualised, entrepreneurial training model to an education cognizant of planetary health and human well-being can accelerate climate change awareness and action"
	  
	  So.....this would really not go down well here in Australia ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511590237855633414))
	- This is a damning chart. All the shortfalls in finance for mitigation across the world:

	- That's it for now. In general, it's a fascinating document. Great to see a bunch of new social science but a few things feel missing, eg consideration of mitigation deterrence, partic from tech promises like CCS, CDR but also PR / marketing (dodgy net zero, greenwashing, offsets) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1511593766326439936))
