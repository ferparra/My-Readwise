document_note:: This book by David Brooks explores the theme of character development through the stories and examples of people throughout history. It argues that success in life is not necessarily a result of external rewards, but rather through self-control, humility, and inner strength. It emphasizes the importance of developing an inner dialogue to battle weaknesses and cultivate a sense of morality. These examples show that even flawed individuals can still become great and that love, grace, and vocation are essential to a good life.
