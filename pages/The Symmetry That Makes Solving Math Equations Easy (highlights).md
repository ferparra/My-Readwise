	- Solving quadratics with the power of symmetry might embolden us to try a similar tactic on cubic equations. But while cubics do have symmetry, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwgxqvn34t3zvkg6yr4nysa3))
		- **Note**: The symmetry of quadratic equations makes them easier to solve. The axis of symmetry of any quadratic function $latex f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ is the line $latex x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, which is demonstrated by the quadratic formula. A similar approach can be used to solve cubic equations, although the symmetry of a cubic equation does not help with finding the roots. The average of the four roots of a quartic equation is equal to the x-value of the axis of symmetry which is $latex -\frac{b}{4a}$.
