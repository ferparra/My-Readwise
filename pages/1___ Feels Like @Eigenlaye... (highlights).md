	- 1/ Feels like @eigenlayer is going to become an #Ethereum game-changer.
	  Here's a quick overview + some resources to dive deeper ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/middlecurver/status/1613223613582446592))

	- 2/ EigenLayer is a series of smart contracts that allows other protocols to take advantage of Ethereum's security without having to build their own trust network, which can be expensive and time-consuming. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/middlecurver/status/1613223616153538561))
	- 3/ This is done through restaking.
	  Restaking is the act of using an already staked asset, such as Ethereum (ETH), to pledge support to another protocol. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/middlecurver/status/1613223618791747584))
	- 4/ By allowing other protocols to inherit staked ETH from validators, EigenLayer enables these protocols to share in Ethereum's security and validation service, without incurring the costs of building their own trust network.

	- 5/ Validators that opt-in to EigenLayer gain additional rewards from the protocols they provide services to. They are also exposed to more slashing risk (if they act maliciously).
	  A set of "rules" will have to be decided between EigenLayer and each protocol on-boarding it.

	- 6/ It's worth noting that the success of EigenLayer will be highly dependent on the security and robustness of the Ethereum network and the ability of the EigenLayer team to continue to attract and onboard validators, developers, and end-users.
