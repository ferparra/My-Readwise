	- Are We in a System?
	  
	  Summary:
	  A lot of people have that when something's too big. And it just paralyzes you as opposed to giving you these action points. I never knew the words path dependency until probably 10 years ago in my reporting. So, but those big features of our landscape are... It's path dependency. We don't have a climate crisis in America. We have a decision crisis on how the government works or doesn't work.

	  Oh, yeah. And it just empowers people to those who believe this, then just sit back, even in Adam McKay's movie, the Don't Look Up movie. There was that sort of Neelist crowd for those who've seen it. You just say, you know, fuck this, we're in. And a lot of people have that when something's too big. Yeah. And it just paralyzes you as opposed to giving you these action points. And the other thing is, I hate it when economists are right about stuff like the... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. No, no, there are these phrases like, I never knew the words path dependency until probably 10 years ago in my reporting. And it basically says you're in a system, the things around you, how we pass laws, the brokenness of the Senate, you know, that those are... We don't have a climate crisis in America. We have a decision crisis as it comes to how the government works or doesn't work. So, but those big features of our landscape are... It's path dependency.

	- Electric Cars Are Great for Climate Change
	  
	  Summary:
	  Electric cars are great. They've got a lot of good opportunities with them, but it's because they've become reified as this thing that you do to fix climate. And right now, they're not really all that great for climate. You need a lot of extra material into the batteries, which is very polluting and also emits a lot of CO2. A lot of electric cars are bought as second cars in the US. So we used to think that they were driven almost as much as a regular car. And it turns out that they're more likely driven less than half as much asa regular car.

	  So look, electric cars are great. I don't own a car, but you know, I've been driving. That's literally signaling. I've flew in here, so it's not like I'm in a way a virtuous guy on that path. But look, they're great cars and eventually electric cars will take over a significant part of our driving. And that's good because they're more effective. They're probably also going to be cheaper. They've got a lot of good opportunities with them, but it's because they've become reified as this thing that you do to fix climate. And right now, they're not really all that great for climate. You need a lot of extra material into the batteries, which is very polluting. And it's also it emits a lot of CO2. A lot of electric cars are bought as second cars in the US. So we used to think that they were driven almost as much as a regular car. And it turns out that they're more likely driven less than half as much as a regular car. So 89% of all Americans who have an electric car also have a real car that they use for the long trips and then they use the electric car for short trips. 89%, 89. So the point here is that it has it's one of these things that become more sort of a virtue signal and thing. Once electric cars are sufficiently cheap, the people will want to buy them. That's great. And they will do some good for the environment. ([Time 0:30:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f5ecc9a5-daf6-4f67-88f1-765b97c13f5e))
	- Is Global Warming Real?
	  
	  Summary:
	  "Electric cars right now in the next decade or so will have a fairly small impact," he says. "We're basically subsidizing these things at five or $10,000 around the world per car." That's just not really sustainable, but it's certainly not a very great way to cut carbon emissions", Nouriel Roubini adds.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  So I think the main point that I've been trying for a long time and I think that's also a little bit what Andy has been talking about for a very long time. The whole conversation was about what does the science tell us as global warming real? And to me, it's much more what can we actually do? What are the policies that we can take and how effective are they going to be? So the conversation we just had about electric cars is a good example of how an economist think about, look, you got to, this is not a question about whether you feel morally virtue, so whether you can sort of display how much you care about the environment. This is about how much you actually ended up affecting the world. And the honest answer is that electric cars right now in the next decade or so will have a fairly small impact and unfortunately right now at a very high cost because we're basically subsidizing these things at five or $10,000 around the world per car. That's just not really sustainable, but it's certainly not a very great way to cut carbon emissions. So I would be the kind of guy and economist would be the types of people who would say, is there a smarter way where you for less money can, for instance, cut more CO2 and the obvious answer is yes, that's what we've seen, for instance, with fracking. In fact, the US went from a lot of coal to a lot of gas because gas became incredibly cheap, because gas emits about half as much as coal does when you use it for electric power. That basically cut more carbon emissions than pretty much any other single thing. And we should get the rest of the world in some sense to frack because it's really cheap. There are some problems and absolutely we can we can also have that conversation that ([Time 0:38:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c939e293-9fee-4584-80a7-23c7c68aafe0))
	- Why Is This So Heated?
	  
	  Summary:
	  In 2006, the stories called yelling fire on a hot planet. That was the first time I interviewed a social scientist, not a climate scientist. She said people go into voting booth thinking about things that are soon salient and certain. And climate change is complex, you know, has long time scales.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  That's why all my articles focused on climate change, and it was 2006. I remember now pretty clearly, I was asked by the weekend review section of the New York Times to write a sort of a weekend thumb sucker, we call them on. Thumb sucker. You know, you said, you said it's the second thing about something. Why is everybody so pissed off about climate change? It was after Al Gore's movie, the Al Gore movie came out and convene a truth, Hurricane Katrina was big Senator in Hoff in the Senate from Oklahoma. I was throwing snowballs, but it was close to that. And so I looked into what was going on. Why is this so heated? In 2006, the stories called yelling fire on a hot planet. And that was the first time, this is after 18 years of writing about global warming. That was the first time I interviewed a social scientist, not a climate scientist. Her name was Helen Ingram. She's the UC Irvine. And she laid out for me the factors that determine why people vote, what they vote for, what they think about politically. And they were the antithesis of the climate problem. She used the words, she said people go into voting booth thinking about things that are soon salient and certain. And climate change is complex, you know, has long time scales. And that really jogged me. And then between 2006, 2010, I started interviewing other social scientists. ([Time 0:45:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/59cd9c29-0af9-4ddf-8afa-7e4208d3a594))
	- The Science of Climate Change
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 3
	  Also meaning so if humans are bad for the environment, I can imagine. It's amazing. That's how you know you made it. He said, Mr.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Revkin of the New York, and the New York Times, if you really think that people are the worst thing that ever happened to this planet, why don't you just kill yourself and save the planet by dying.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  That was tough for you.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  It was tough for my family. You know, to me, it did generate some interesting calls and stuff in my voicemail. But on the left, I was also undercut. Roger Pilkey, Jr. A prominent researcher of climate risk and climate policy, UC Boulder, was actively his career track was derailed purposefully by people who just thought his message was too off off the path. And you know, you've been dealing with this for a very long time. So I just want to get back to the science.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I don't think the science get it so much wrong as it just becomes accepted to make certain assumptions as you just said, we assume no friction. So, you know, there's a way that you kind of model the world that ends up being also a convenient message in many ways.
