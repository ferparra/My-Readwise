	- Do you have a fixed mindset or a growth mindset?
	  
	  A growth mindset is when you see challenges as opportunities to learn, instead of obstacles you can't overcome.
	  
	  Most of us have a fixed mindset most of the time. But, it's possible to cultivate a new one!

	- The self-esteem movement of last century created a lot of mediocre people who are afraid of challenges.
	  
	  When you're complimented on qualities you have, you're less motivated to improve. But, if you're praised for your process, things start to change. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1363810882749419520))
	- The growth mindset was discovered by looking at how students react to challenges.
	  
	  When students believe they can change their intelligence, they show more grit and joy for the process.
	  
	  Students with a fixed mindset don't bother trying, giving up quickly as they see no use. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1363810884045451264))
	- Research shows that mindset is more important than privilege.
	  
	  Schools that cultivate the growth mindset consistently outperform schools that don'tâ€”even if the growth mindset students have disadvantaged backgrounds. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1363810885299544066))

	- Innate talent plays only a small role.
	  
	  High performers all put in tremendous effort. For example, Michael Jordan was an average player until he become obsessed with the game.
	  
	  What you bring to the table are just raw materials; you have to make something from your capabilities. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1363810886549450757))
	- Our mindsets are on a spectrum; they're not a dichotomy.
	  
	  You can have different mindsets in different areas in life.
	  
	  Look for what triggers the fixed mindset and become conscious of your reaction. In these moments you can steer yourself toward a growth mindset. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1363810887757422593))

	- Look out for trigger words.
	  
	  When you give feedback to someone (even yourself), using words like 'smart' or 'stupid' can have a strong effect.
	  
	  When you're perceived as smart you're more likely to narrow your life so you're only confronted with the things you're good at handling. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1363810888881430528))
	- Companies should also stimulate a growth mindset.
	  
	  Unfortunately, most companies value (in their actions) raw talent over the belief that people can grow.
	  
	  Making mistakes is punished in these companies, stifling any chance of a growth mindset coming to fruition. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1363810890076868609))

	- Employees in true growth mindset companies feel empowered.
	  
	  When you know and feel creativity and innovation are valued, you're more committed to the company. Even when mistakes are made, you learn and show that you have the mindset to embrace challenges. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1363810891091836928))
	- Interviewers should look for the growth mindset in potential new hires.
	  
	  Instead of looking for people who boast about their abilities, check what their process is.
	  
	  Ask questions like:
	  â€¢ What are you biggest failures?
	  â€¢ How would/do you share credit for successes? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1363810891955908613))
	- People with a fixed mindset are more likely to cheat.
	  
	  Cheating happens a lot in companies where people feel they need to look smarter than others.
	  
	  Most of us want to achieve results, but what do you do if you don't believe you can improve? You fake it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1363810893235167236))
	- When a company wants to promote a growth mindset, it should come from the top.
	  
	  But, actions speak louder than words. Rewards should be for team work and sharing information. Plus, people should be mentored in what it truly means to have a growth mindset. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1363810894048878594))

	- Use the power of "yet."
	  
	  Your current level of ability is a snapshot; you can improve if you want.
	  
	  Whenever you say a fixed mindset statement like "I'm not... kind of person," add the word "yet" to indicate you can get there but just haven't crossed the finish line yet. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1363810894933876737))
