	- This component has multiple variants to indicate whether a route is by subway or train. 
	  
	  Variants are situational. When a component is designed to be used in different scenarios, each different design is called a variant.

	- This component also has multiple states to show favorited routes or if there's a delay.
	  
	  States are reactive. When a component changes appearance based on user interaction or app data, we say it has states.
