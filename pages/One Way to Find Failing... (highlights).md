- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 18th, 2022]]
	- The graduate admissions that I’ve seen is pretty healthy. The endless debates on whether or not to use GRE seem beside the point: discussions on who to admit, in my experience, end up as really interesting conversations about science itself.

	- Faculty hiring is more complicated, and it’s easier for people to look at metrics. Usually, how many papers in “top” journals; sometimes divided by the number of years the person’s been out.
	- When I’ve looked over at startup culture, the metrics seem extreme: obsessive tracking of users, engagement, dollars, etc—coupled with arbitrary goals of being, say, “Ramen profitable”.
	- Worth pointing to Keynes on “small” (meaning management==ownership) business. These were the backbone of the modern bourgeois world, and they basically has no metrics at all. https://t.co/1iHHw2bokT
	- @nntaleb might say that you turn to [[metrics]] when you no longer have [[skin in the game]]—when your goal is not the thing itself, but convincing others that you have it (and dashing off before your pants fall down).
	- Metrics are famously a form of control, but one whose essential job is to fool people. A high h-index department is one that convinces USNWR (etc) that it’s doing good science. Metrics control image, not substance.

	- I think about this in terms of the “quantified self”—the use of metrics for one’s personal life. There, I think it’s interestingly mixed.
	- Because (flip side) metrics are a way of paying attention. A person can benefit a great deal from being told (say) they’ve gained 10 lbs, or can lift 30 lbs more, or slept more regularly this week than last.
	- One can imagine using metrics defensively: as a way to escape the ways your own biases, and those of your environment, structure and control attention. It’s a bit of Tai Chi, allowing metrics to battle each other to a standstill.
	- But in the end, allowing your attention to be governed by metrics—no matter how complex—is giving up the greater part of your freedom. Paying attention is, finally, the way we construct meaningful lives.
	- Offloading those choices to a system is fundamentally confining. Weighing yourself, or counting calories, can draw attention to how you eat—but only if you stop in time. Similar truths apply to institutions.
	- I would flip it around: healthy institutions have a notion of quality that evolves so rapidly the metrics look (obviously) unreasonable... https://t.co/zDsKrR9p6l
	- You can see this in early CS research which was moving so fast it evolved norms for sharing results that we’re still trying to integrate into academic metrics (conferences vs journals).
	- That’s a really interesting angle. I would say a degree (in that analysis) is not a metric, but a proxy, in the same way that “number of lbs you can deadlift” is a proxy for strength.

	- I take a different lesson there, Bowles/Gintis, _Schooling in Capitalist America_: a degree is proof-by-example that you can be a good (passive, rule-abiding) worker. In that case it’s a test! (So we have metrics, proxies, and tests...)
	- More explicitly: people who have no idea about X and yet being in charge of managing it! https://t.co/7uxs6pohCt
