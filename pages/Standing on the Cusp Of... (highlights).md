	- Standing on the cusp of 2021, life can be exhausting.
	  
	  No matter where we look on social media, we will find people who seem wealthier, luckier, prettier, healthier, more popular, smarter, happier than us.
	  
	  As highly ambitious people, what are we to do?
	  
	  A solution to considerüëáüèæ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1343630548355313664))
	- The solution, in three words:
	  
	  Aim for Mediocrity ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1343630550314090496))
	- Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done for years now:
	  
	  1) Aim to be mediocre at most things.
	  
	  2) Celebrate this mediocrity.
	  
	  3) Then focus on excellence at a few things.
	  
	  4) Make sure those few things align with my passions, my strengths, and what the world needs.
	  
	  contd.üëáüèæ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1343630551891079168))
	- 5) Work hard at those few things for long periods of time.
	  
	  6) Find rewards in the act of getting better, not in immediate external feedback.
	  
	  7) Get clarity on what rewards really matter.
	  
	  8) Trust that those rewards will come.
	  
	  9) Tweak my approach as I learn more. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1343630553669459968))
	- An acceptance of our mediocrity is a ticket to freedom.
	  
	  Very few smart & ambitious people recognize this.
	  
	  This isn‚Äôt about giving up or "being a loser".
	  
	  It‚Äôs about recognizing that very few of the things that bring us lifelong anxiety actually matter, when all is said & done. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1343630555275878400))

	- Alright, so how might we go about executing on this?
	  
	  My answer:
	  Life principles.
	  
	  I‚Äôll leave you with some of my life principles below.
	  
	  They are always work in progress, but the ones below have stayed stable for the past 3-4 years. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1343630556806823936))
	- Note: 
	  
	  I am not saying these should be YOUR life principles or ANYONE‚Äôs life principles. Examples are useful for clear writing, so view them as merely an example of what‚Äôs worked/working for one person. If something resonates, consider adopting it. If something repels, ignore it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1343630558350327808))
	- Principle 1:
	  
	  I don‚Äôt wish to be remembered after I die. By anyone. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1343630559675731968))
	- Principle 2:
	  
	  I don‚Äôt wish to be famous while I am alive. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1343630561198317568))
	- Principle 3:
	  
	  I want to be wealthy, but I do not seek to be the wealthiest person I personally know. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1343630562729238528))
	- Principle 4:
	  
	  I do want to be the wisest person I personally know. To do this, I want to learn from everyone I come in contact with. Everyone. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1343630564302020608))
	- Principle 5:
	  
	  I do not want to do anything that‚Äôs mainly aimed at impressing others. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1343630565870727168))
	- Principle 6:
	  
	  I do want to be the best parent I possibly can. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1343630567380676608))
	- Principle 7:
	  
	  I want to continue learning my craft as best as I possibly can.
	  
	  (in my case, this craft is mainly product management)
	  
	  (this principle has lasted the longest in my list, approximately the past 15 years) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1343630568806703105))
	- And finally, the principle that enables me to follow these 7 principles as faithfully as I can:
	  
	  I accept mediocrity in other aspects of my life.
	  Sometimes I‚Äôll do better than mediocre (great)
	  Other times, I‚Äôll do worse (not great, but fine)
	  Just be good-enough to avoid disaster. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1343630570736087041))
