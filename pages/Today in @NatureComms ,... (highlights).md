	- Today in @NatureComms , Will Shaw (@willmshaw) and I finally share our new work collaborating with Xiaozhou (David) Luo @ SIAT, developing a yeast-based biosensor & workflow for screening microbially-produced Œî9-tetrahydrocannbinol, better known as ùóßùóõùóñüßµhttps://t.co/dOrvkP26eq ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfTomEllis/status/1572217544433434627))

	- Producing cannabinoids from microbial fermentation is an exciting way to create these promising therapeutic (and let‚Äôs be honest, recreational) compounds. The number of companies founded recently for the bioengineering of cannabinoids highlights the lucrative market potential.

	- BUT, metabolic engineering development requires a whole load of screening to identify high producers and this is currently limited to methods such as LC-MS. A cannabinoid biosensor would open the door to quicker, easier, and cheaper development cycles. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfTomEllis/status/1572217549563244545))
	- We decided to have a go a creating a cannabinoid biosensor by building on our previous work (and the work of many others) for porting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) into yeast and coupling this to a fluorescent protein output (https://t.co/Hl3qCjiE3Q). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfTomEllis/status/1572217551542681601))
	- We ported 5 different human GPCRs known to interact with cannabinoids, showing that the cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R) was functional in yeast and had great biosensing characteristics straight out of the box, with a high dynamic and operational range.

	- < At this point, we should also give a shout out to Karel Miettinen @KarelMiettinen and Sotirios Kampranis‚Äô group at UCPH @KampranisLab who also reported a CB2R yeast biosensor, while we were in the late stages of review (https://t.co/7JKKtuISe5) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfTomEllis/status/1572217555632230400))
	- While we focus on the application to metabolic engineering, they put a huge effort into the optimisation of the CB2 biosensing strain with a choice of colorimetric, fluorescent and luciferase outputs (creating a biosensing strain that looks quite a bit better than ours!) > ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfTomEllis/status/1572217557788266496))
	- However, we were interested to see whether our yeast GPCR-based biosensor could be used for reporting relative yields of cannabinoids from microbial production. This turned out to be a challenge! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfTomEllis/status/1572217559965134848))
	- Cannabinoids have diverse effects on the CB2 receptor. For example, THC is an agonist, while conversely, CBD is an antagonist. Both of which are present in high amounts in plant extract, obscuring precise quantification of either molecule.

	- This picture is simplified in microbial systems, as we can limit cannabinoid diversity by choosing to omit the various synthases that are present in cannabis. However, extracted samples will still be a complex mixture of a few competing by-products. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfTomEllis/status/1572217567221088256))
	- THC was the clear choice to focus on as we expected this very potent compound would ‚Äúpunch through‚Äù the effects of other by-products, and so we developed a medium-throughput workflow for screening this molecule from yeast producer strains.

	- We optimised the yeast biosensor for use on a plate reader, and the team at SIAT, led by the talented Yunfeng Zhang, developed a workflow for preparing samples from yeast and screened > 100 mutant strains they had generated to see whether we could pick out the high producers.

	- While the results of the large screen were quite noisy due to the complexity of the extracted samples, we were able to pick out top producers, showing its usefulness for enriching producer libraries. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfTomEllis/status/1572217577719627776))
	- We hope this biosensor workflow will be useful to many teams trying to produce THC from microbial fermentation. More to the point, it demonstrates yet another example in which GPCRs are an amazing source of biosensing elements, in this case human GPCRs directly related to health.

	- A big thanks üôèüôè to all involved on three different continents, including to Graham Ladds @GpcrL and Mo Khalil @MoKhalilLab for their support kick-starting and then wrapping up this project, respectfully. And of course to UKRI @UKRI_News for invaluable funding. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfTomEllis/status/1572217581657792515))
	- Are you still here? If so then allow me to also say that this whole thread should really be a 'Co-tweet' between @willmshaw & me. We can't because UK Twitter can't do this yet, but Will really led this entire project himself and so deserves to be seen as the face of it. üëèüëèüëèüëè ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfTomEllis/status/1572217583746838529))
