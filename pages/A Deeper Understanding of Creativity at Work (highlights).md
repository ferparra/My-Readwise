	- The Role of Creativity in Mental Health
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Creativity is an important way to set ourselves apart from our peers and competitors, and it is essential for mental health., * Creativity is essential for problem solving in a rapidly changing environment.)

	  Gabriela, let's start with you. Just for context, why is creativity such an important way for us to set ourselves apart? You know, not just from robots, but also from our peers and competitors.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, so the robot parts a little bit important to start with. We are seeing the less creative, more wrote parts of our job taken over by automation. And that, in our view, is probably a good thing. It means our jobs become more interesting and more human. And part of the overarching climate that this is happening within is changing so rapidly. And it's such a global scale that the challenges we're facing are very different than in previous eras. They're novel, right? It's not the same thing kind of recurring in different forms. They're unpredictable. They're uncertain. And so it requires inherently a creative and novel approach because it's a new problem. Those of us who can rise to the opportunity to see those challenges as times to shine as creatives, as times to put forward our ideas and lean into that need of creativity will thrive in this environment. And part of our work and our hope is to empower people to identify as creatives and to build that muscle.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  And Marty, you and Gabriela are both psychologists. What role does creativity play in mental health?
	  
	  Speaker 4
	  Why are these issues that you two think about? ([Time 0:02:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0f97eeb7-02d7-40cd-8195-9fdf0860ba1a))
	- The Default Circuit: How Imagination Creates Our Future
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* The default circuit is activated when people are just lying there, not doing anything., * The creativity circuit was discovered by studying how the default circuit is activated.)

	  I think the most important discovery in neuroscience of my lifetime was a remarkable figure ground reversal. Like many people who are interested in what brain circuits light up when you're doing a specific task, like listening to this podcast, for example, how do you find out? Well, there are a thousand studies of the following form to ask what part of the brain lights up when you're doing an external task. We put people into the donut and we give them a lecture to listen to anagrams to solve external problems. But we also run a control group because you have to act contrasted to something. So we ask people, oh, just lie there and don't do anything. Well, what showed up was a huge reversal. And that is if you look at what lights up when you're listening to this podcast, it's very noisy. You have to be a really good statistician to pull out what's going on. But if you look at what lights up when I ask you just to lie there and don't do anything, it is so regular that we call it the default circuit. And it turns out to be the very same circuit that lights up if I ask you to plan for the future. So it turns out that the creativity circuit, the imagination circuit was discovered by ([Time 0:10:31](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7a3ff139-82ba-415c-ad58-fbd06c22fe0e))
	- The Importance of Incubation for Creative Problem Solving
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Incubation is the period in between really focused work on a particular problem, but in the background of our conscious minds., * It is important to do just enough so tasks that require a minimal amount of conscious attention, but still some that you don't want to just be lying in bed but taking a walk., * Incubation leads to the richest daydreaming, the richest incubation, and then richer output.)

	  Incubation is the period in between really focused work on a particular problem we're working on it but in the background of our conscious minds and we know that there are activities that interfere with high quality incubation so busy work messaging meetings lots of things that we spend our days at work doing they interfere with high quality incubation what's best for incubation of creative problems is doing just enough so tasks that require a minimal amount of conscious attention but still some you don't want to just be lying in bed but taking a walk gardening showering all of these things are sort of on autopilot this is what leads to the richest daydreaming the richest incubation and then we'll result in richer output.
