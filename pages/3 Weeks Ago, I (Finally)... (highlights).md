	- 3 weeks ago, I (finally) got into @tana_inc
	  
	  Exactly 1 month after becoming a Master in Computer Science (focused on AI + NLP).
	  
	  Trust me when I say this:
	  
	  • Tana is State-of-the-art.
	  • It's like NOTHING you've seen before.
	  
	  How Tana works + why it's overpowered:🧵 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1608130385262841864))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- If you are reading this:
	  
	  🍪 You're in for a treat.
	  
	  I'll take you on a journey to answer:
	  
	  • What is Tana?
	  • Why is there nothing like it?
	  • Which features make it world-class?
	  
	  ↓ Let's begin ↓ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1608130387905236994))
	- Tana is a 🦸‍♂️ Super 🕸 Graph.
	  
	  As @cortexfutura would say:
	  • "In Tana, Everything is a Node"
	  
	  Allow me to take it one step further.
	  
	  In Tana:
	  • "Everything can be a 🦸‍♂️Super Node"
	  • "You connect things with 🦸‍♂️Super Edges"
	  
	  And what exactly are nodes and edges?↓ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1608130390551822338))
	- Nodes and Edges are core pieces of:
	  
	  • Graphs 🕸
	  
	  A Graph is a mathematical structure used in Information Science.
	  
	  That models Networks & Relationships.
	  
	  G = (V, E)
	  
	  V = Vertices (nodes)
	  E = Edges (links)
	  
	  • Nodes are points (intersections)
	  • Edges are links (relationships) 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FlE6EsRaMAAUM8V.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1608130400177786881))
	- Tana provides Superpowers to Graphs.
	  
	  Tana transforms:
	  
	  • Nodes into Super Nodes
	  (using Supertags)
	  
	  • Edges into Super Edges
	  (using Fields and Live Searches)
	  
	  Let's dive deeper into these concepts ↓ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1608130404082679808))
	- Tana adds SuperTags to Nodes.
	  
	  SuperTag = 🔖Tag + 🦸‍♂️Super
	  
	  🔖 Tag = Label
	  
	  Tags apply the "isA" relation to a Node:
	  
	  • (Node X) "isA" (instance of class Y)
	  
	  Tags indicate that a Node belongs to a certain class (category), just like a label.
	  
	  Examples in the Graph above: 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FlE6FXKaAAAfgN6.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1608130414077685762))
	- Now you're probably asking:
	  
	  "What makes Tags become 🦸‍♂️Super?"
	  
	  There are 4 major reasons:
	  
	  1• SuperTags have Fields (SuperEdges)
	  2• Fields can have user-defined relations
	  3• SuperTags automatically surface info
	  4• Nodes inherit structure from Tags
	  
	  Let's break them down↓ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1608130418179727362))
	- 1• SuperTags have "Fields" (SuperEdges)
	  
	  Fields = Attributes = Variables = hasA
	  
	  Fields are like Columns in an Excel Table
	  
	  • Fields add information
	  • Fields store relationships
	  • Fields represent characteristics
	  
	  (Fields in Tana are much more complex than Excel Tables) 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FlE6GLfaMAAiMB3.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1608130427432357888))
	- 2• Fields can have user-defined relations
	  
	  In Tana, field instances can be defined as belonging to a class (Supertag).
	  
	  This creates:
	  • Custom relationship between classes
	  
	  See example below:
	  
	  Seed Note has a custom relationship called "hasConcept"
	  
	  That Links to Concept Nodes

	- 3 • SuperTags automatically surface info
	  
	   In Tana, Tags bring you information.
	  
	  Tags will Search, Compute, + Show data from anywhere in your Tana workspace.
	  
	  Ex:
	  
	  • Fields to help you remember Frameworks
	  • Live Searches to grab info from other Tag

	- 4 • Nodes inherit structure from Tags
	  
	  In Tana, you pre-define a Tag's structure with Fields and Information.
	  
	  For every Tag that you add to a Node,
	  
	  The Node will:
	  
	  • Inherit the Tag's structure
	  • Show info surfaced by the Tag
	  
	  (Including multiple tags – see example↓)

	- Data moves fluidly through Tana's veins.
	  
	  These reasons make Tana ELITE for:
	  
	  📍Discoverability
	  📍Flexibility
	  
	  • Discoverability (Retrieval) is a CORE aspect of PKM.
	  • Flexibility is what makes PKM "Personal"
	  
	  Here's why Tana is great at these.
	  
	  First, Discoverability: ↓ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1608130463830540288))
	- Knowledge Management has 4 processes  (Alavi & Leidner, 2001):
	  
	  1. Creation
	  2. Storage and Retrieval
	  3. Transfer
	  4. Application
	  
	  Retrieval is usually the hardest.
	  
	  Tana DOES IT for you:
	  
	  • WHAT you want
	  • In Multiple Formats
	  • Updated Automatically
	  • WHERE you'll "apply" it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1608130466556817417))
	- Tana is also elite in Flexibility:
	  
	  It's a TRUE "Personal" Knowledge Graph.
	  
	  A Knowledge Graph (KG) is a Graph with special abilities.
	  
	  KGs store descriptions and linked semantic relationships between:
	  
	  • Entities
	  • Objects
	  • Events
	  • Abstract Concepts
	  
	  Tana makes it Personal 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FlE6I_rakAIfwo-.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1608130474375000074))
	- In Tana, you create your own Ontology.
	  
	  Ontology = the language (structure) of a KG
	  
	  Ontology = Schema in Tana
	  
	  • What types of Entities exist
	  • What Relationships exist
	  • Between which Entities
	  • In what Hierarchy
	  
	  In Tana, you can represent anything

	- Tana being so Flexible + Personal makes it state-of-the-art for:
	  
	  • Action Management
	  • Personal Development
	  • Knowledge Management
	  
	  No other tool has a very-high-quality service for as many use cases.
	  
	  Tana is a juggernaut for personal systems (while still in private Beta) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1608130480997793792))
	- The 🍒 cherry on top:
	  
	  Tana's data structure:
	- Thank you very much for reading thus far.
	  
	  I want to end this thread with a small reflection for you.
	  
	  It's regarding the DIKW (WKID) Pyramid.
	  
	  • Wisdom
	  • Knowledge
	  • Information
	  • Data
	  
	  As Knowledge workers, we're always moving up this pyramid ↓

	- Now think about this:
	  
	  • A Computer structures Data
	  • Word and Excel structure Information
	  • A TfT structures Knowledge
	  • The Human Mind structures Wisdom
	  
	  @tana_inc is state-of-the-art to structure knowledge.
	  
	  But it's your Wisdom that matters.
	  
	  Let's get Wiser with Tana. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1608130499716984832))
	- Again, Thank you for your time!
	  
	  I hope you enjoyed this thread.
	  And you have access to Tana 😅
