document_note:: Johnathan Bi discusses the mimetic theory of French philosopher René Girard and how it explains the true origin of desire. He outlines two branches of motivational forces of human nature: metaphysical desire (identity) and physical desire (aims at experience). The mimetic theory gives us a framework to avoid situations that inspire debilitating desires, as well as understanding ourselves and the world. Mimesis is the fundamental capacity and tendency to gain access to the subjectivity of others and reproduce objective cultural forms, making us social beings.

	- **For Girard, there are two branches of motivational forces of human nature**
	  
	  •   **Metaphysical desire (identity)**
	  •   **Physical desire (aims at experience)** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9j01tt326nqa2g860jfemn))
	- **“René Girard showed me how I was caught up in meaningless status competitions and how much I was driven by desires that weren’t even my own.”** – *David Perell* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9j0k686pvvp059xjrjrczk))
	- •   Most of us aren’t doing things for their own sake but out of what Gerard would call mimesis – our natural capacity and tendency to imitate others
	    •   **“2000 of allegedly some of America’s smartest and most independent kids all end up after college wanting to go into four fields finance tech law and medicine.”** – Johnathan Bi ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9j1b7qdvxq85bn9g2thzs5))
	- **“When you are already deeply envious or prideful the battle is already lost, there’s nothing about understanding mimetic theory can do for you.”**– Johnathan Bi
	  
	  •   The mimetic theory gives us a framework to avoid situations that inspire debilitating desires; what type of person to avoid and who to keep close
	  •   It teaches us how to construct a social environment that is relatively sober and how to identify ones that are prone to mimetic contagion
	  •   **“Mimetic theory does not give us the power to resist damaging instances of mimesis at the moment but it does give us the foresight to avoid them altogether.”**– *Johnathan Bi* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9j2bdztz5b6d363y7m84jy))
		- **Note**: Johnathan Bi is saying that mimetic theory can help us understand how to build a good social environment and how to recognize people who can lead us down a bad path. Even if we know this theory, it doesn't mean we can always resist making bad decisions, but it can help give us the wisdom to stay away from those bad decisions in the first place.
	- Example to better illustrate Girard’s point:
	  
	  •   Think of co-vibrating violin strings
	  •   As you flick one string, a similar frequency of vibration will translate to the other
	  •   For humans, these vibrations are actions experiences, judgments, intentions, etc.
	  •   Humans are social animals prone to this type of co-vibration
	  •   Just as strings on a violin aren’t independent, neither are we ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9j3wntt4frgzmsgm80n5ap))
	- **The desire to be at the heart of metaphysical desire is aimed at the “fullness of being”**
	  
	  •   Metaphysical desire takes form as a pursuit of objects in the most general sense of the term
	  •   Wanting to climb Mount Everest, buying a particular car or dating a particular person
	  •   In all of these experiences, Girard would say it’s never objects we are after
	  •   **“I don’t think this is a foreign concept to us, this-worldly achievement-focused consumer society we want to acquire objects to bolster and back up our identity.” –** *Johnathan Bi* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9j55tdjzjxxzrkpyccyf5k))
	- Breaking away from the group to carve your own path can also be socially determined ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9j5jzk505j0z9v60ajk95a))
	- Distance oneself to show one’s superiority ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9j5qs9knq48jgnq3gy8pp2))
	- •   Girard is trying to take down what he conceives of as the “romantic lie”
	    •   We’re all individuals with a core of what we call the authentic self and layers of social constraints
	    •   Removing these social layers can be just as socially determined as rigid adherence
	    •   **“You’re confusing difference for autonomy you’re confusing distance for independence and your confusing originality for freedom.”** – *Johnathan Bi* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9j64sr2wgnrdrgk130drph))
		- **Note**: Johnathan Bi says that some people think that if they act differently than other people, they are free and independent. But Johnathan says this is not true - being different from others does not mean you are free and independent.
	- Our values, aesthetics, taste, and even philosophical positions are often heavily defined by others in deep and unconscious ways ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9j78gxsp66d5q9wwzhdxpm))
	- **“We may think our desires are our own, we may think we desire our spouse just because of who they are or at the very least because of their physical attractiveness but Girard shows that even this turns out not to be the full extent of the story.”** – *Johnathan Bi* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9j7gffnf54rtrjyrhkgt5q))
