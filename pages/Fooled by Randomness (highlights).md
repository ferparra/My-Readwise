document_note:: The main takeaway from this text is that we cannot accurately predict large events and our success can be wiped out in one catastrophic event. We should never be sure our theories are correct and always consider the possibility that our assumptions may be wrong. We should reduce exposure to noise in order to make the best of randomness and act as stoics when facing random events.
