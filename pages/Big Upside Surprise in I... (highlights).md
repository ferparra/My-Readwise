	- Big upside surprise in inflation.
	  Big downside surprise in consumer sentiment.
	  
	  Let's break down the figures, the bond market moves and have a look at what lies ahead for several asset classes.
	  
	  A thread.

	- Inflation surprised on the upside, and to avoid base effects distorting the picture you should focus on month-on-month changes.
	  
	  MoM core inflation printed at 0.63%, accelerating on the upside again and beating all estimates.
	  
	  But let's look under the hood.

	- The composition of inflationary pressures is a very important factor to analyze
	  
	  Shelter (red) and core services (white) are explaining most of the upside pressures in CPI
	  
	  Food and energy are also contributing of course, and the only line trending down is used cars (green)

	- Price pressures are hence broadening.
	  
	  The chart below shows how >70% of the components of the CPI basket are now recording an above 4% YoY price increase.
	  
	  And on top of that, price pressures are moving to the late-cycle, sticky items...

	- ...which are well represented in the core services basket.
	  
	  Core goods are starting to come off and given the large amount of inventory build-up we should continue to see that.
	  
	  But the sticky core services inflation is running >5%, the highest pace in 30+ years!

	- Before we look at bond market reactions: if you have a view on inflation, the most straightforward way to put that into action without complex derivatives I could find is with the guys at https://t.co/bDuDCVRIyj.
	  
	  Cool product: ''Yes'' or ''No'' contracts - as simple as that!

	- The University of Michigan data were released too, by the way.
	  
	  The 5-10y consumer inflation expectation jumped to 3.3% (the highest since 2008) and consumer sentiment dropped to the lowest in 80 years!
	  
	  Which brings us to the very compelling bond market reaction...

	- The obvious reaction is to push the Fed hiking rates towards:
	- The hiking cycle pricing was moved to be even more front-loaded, with the terminal rate now to be reached already by Q2-23.
	  
	  What's priced in after that?
	  
	  30+ bps worth of cuts (!) from the Fed.
	  Demand destruction is priced to happen quick.

	- Another way to look at it is to observe the OIS curve, which solely reflect traders' expectations for the future path of Fed Funds rate.
	  
	  It's completely inverted after the 2-year point.

	- Credit spreads are puking.
	  
	  Even the investment grade US corporate bonds now have to offer a wider and wider premium over US Treasuries to attract marginal investors.
	  
	  We are about to take off the 2018 highs there.

	- Markets will keep pushing for a more assertive Fed: real yields have to move significantly higher for the monetary policy stance to become convincingly tight to tame inflation.
	  
	  5y US real yields are just slightly positive...
	  
	  ...markets will demand more.

	- Higher real yields as consumer sentiment drops like a stone and economic activity slows down are a recipe for wider risk premia.
	  
	  My model points towards a still pretty benign equity risk premium, though...

	- If we assume real yields have to stay here or move higher, and we want to see equity risk premia move to levels consistent with such an uncertain economic and monpol environment we are looking at SPX 12m forward P/E in the 15-ish area.
	  
	  It's now still above 17.

	- On top of it, earnings are still priced to grow in double-digit territory
	  
	  I'll take the under there
	  
	  All in all, the SPX could drop another 10-15% at least from here as a combo of lower multiples & lower EPS and I wouldn't be surprised
	  
	  My next target on the short is 3,750

	- As argued on https://t.co/HtlHaKOguK from Dec 2021 (& reflected in my publicly available trades) this is NOT the time to play offense
	  
	  Stay defensive, & consider subscribing (it's free) as next week I'm going to cover the Fed meeting and deliver a portfolio update
