	- I need your help modifying a code package to implement a new feature in my blog, which is a AWS Amplify web application written with React.js. You will output a series of terminal commands to read files, make changes, and view the directory structure as necessary. Any commands you output will be automatically pasted straight into my terminal and I'll give you back the raw output so you can see the result. So, for example, if you need to see your current directory structure you can output "ls" and I will give you the result. Note that you'll be working with a mac (unix) terminal. If you need to read a file you could use "cat filename". When you encounter a file that needs to be changed, you can use the 'sed' command to edit the file where you see fit. For example, like this: sed -i.bak "s/function App()/const App = () =>/" /Users/jasonholtkamp/code/llmpromptengineering/src/App.js && rm /Users/jasonholtkamp/code/llmpromptengineering/src/App.js.bak If you would like to run a unit test to confirm the behavior of the system after you've made changes, simply output the command to run, and I will put it in my terminal, then give you back the output. Keep in mind that you are free to write new unit tests and edit existing ones. When the feature is implemented and all tests pass, your job is done. At that point, please output the commands you need to create a new git branch, and then submit a CR against the following repository: https://github.com/jasondotparse/llmpromptengineering.git Lastly, remember that you are GPT-4, and you have a maximum input token size of 32,000, so you'll have to be strategic about which files you navigate to and in what order so that you do not exceed your "short term memory" constraint before you accomplish your goal. And remember that every single output that you reply with will be automatically copy/pasted straight into my terminal, so you should only give output which a linux shell can understand. It might be helpful to use a recursive approach where you use the OpenAI ChatGPT API to implement sub-features with different git branches, and then merge them in pursuit of your overall goal. If you need to do so, you can use the following command: curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" -d '{ "model": "gpt-4", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}] }' Use the API key [your api key here]. Every single thing that you output will be automatically copy/pasted directly into the terminal, so make sure your response does not include any text that is not a valid terminal command, or the command will fail. Your job is done when, on the "newfeature" branch of the git repository, the feature is complete and all tests pass. Here is the feature request: Please add a button to the main home page of my blog app, which when pressed, sends a GET request to my node.js server endpoint at http://52.35.105.104:3000/jasonwasright ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw0t9pryhrdd6c7j00gjx184))
