	  But now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Dr. John Barry. Why did you found the Center for Male Psychology? There's a couple of reasons.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  One is the general need for more accurate information on men's psychology. The other was because we had already got a male psychology section of the British Psychological Society that was facing the professional people dealing with psychology and men's mental health. But we also needed to have something that was more public facing because I found over the years I've been doing this for about 10 years, 12 years now. There's actually a lot more interest and awareness funnily enough about men's psychology in the general public than there is within the professional psychology. I was quite surprised when I started to understand this, but not only are people outside psychology more interested in male psychology or men's mental health, but there seem to have more insights than a lot of people who are in psychology. I say that and I feel a bit embarrassed for my profession.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Why do you think that is?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, I think that there's a lot of it is the education in the further commons that we get about gender, especially in psychology. Part of it is that we, there's a bit of a blind spot in that we don't really even focus on men as a topic of interest at any level of psychology education. The one exception now is the University of Sunderland has got a module, an undergraduate module on male psychology, which gets brilliant feedback, but it's the one piece of a module in the world that focuses on man psychology. So we have on one side a blind spot to even looking in that direction. But also when we do look in that direction, we often have a kind of see it through a particular lens that sort of distorts what people see. So we tend to see men as being really the architects of their own problems. There's a fair bit of what you could call victim blaming that happens. So if men have mental health problems and they fail to seek therapy or any kind of help and they don't speak to people because they're too manly and stoical whilst they're on fault kind of if they end up ending their own lives. I mean, I actually, on my undergraduate degree back in the 90s, when we were discussing male suicide, which was discussed in the space about two minutes compared to talking about a lot of other topics in mental health, including women's depression, which we just really went into quite some detail. When I came to explaining male suicide, given that women are twice as likely to have severe depression than men are, but men of three times were likely to come suicide than women are. But the explanation given was that men are better at DIY. So they just construct better methods of getting rid themselves. And in my seminar group, that got a little kind of ripple of laughter. And I was kind of sitting there thinking, well, you know, I'm not, I'm here to learn. But I'm just, I'm not really sure I'm learning anything very good here. There's no theory behind here. It's almost like we've just had a little bit of stand up. And outside afterwards, we had a break and someone came up to you and said, there was a woman still, you know, well done. I don't know how you managed to sit there through that and saying nothing. And I mean, I just, as I said, like, you know, and lots of students are, I think, the same, you know, you're there to learn and you absorb this information. You think that it's a professor telling me this, it must be true. And, you know, so we, we just don't get enough accurate information about men psychology.
