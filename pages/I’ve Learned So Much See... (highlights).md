	- Iâ€™ve learned so much seeing @retool scale from <100 to 1000s of customers over the last 2 years.
	  
	  Given our recent Series C, I wanted to share share some of the lessons we discovered along the way ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CuffeJamie/status/1481348827760132096))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1. Bet on slope over intercept.
	  
	  Our top seller this year was an engineer. Our top CSM was a founder. Our top paid marketer was a student. Our top EMs had never managed. Domain experience is overrated. Great leaders identify potential. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CuffeJamie/status/1481348829098102789))
	- 2. Ex-founders are worth their weight in gold.
	  
	  Sales, success, design, product, ops and engineering were all built by former founders. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CuffeJamie/status/1481348830104748033))
	- 3. Create a talent vortex.
	  
	  One early employee referred >20 hiresâ€”1/3rd of our team at the time. Hiring top caliber people first (even if slow) allows you to speed up hiring later on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CuffeJamie/status/1481348831048388608))
	- 4. Transparency is an accelerant.
	  
	  Teams do their best work in high trust environments. Every email is sent to an open archive@ email list so everyone has the context they need. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CuffeJamie/status/1481348832105431045))
	- 5. Hiring is the defining skill for leaders.
	  
	  Our best leaders hire and ramp their own teams. Ownership to build your team permeates both managers and ICs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CuffeJamie/status/1481348833149784065))
	- 6. The market for self-hosted software is huge.
	  
	  On-prem isnâ€™t dead, in fact itâ€™s growing. Our first customers started self-hosted and even today itâ€™s a majority of our revenue. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CuffeJamie/status/1481348834106036225))
	- 7. Build your own playbook.
	  
	  The most important parts of our customer lifecycle, like customer hackathons and co-building sessions, took us 100s of customers to define. Never just run a playbook because it worked somewhere else. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CuffeJamie/status/1481348835087503363))
	- 8. Engineer your GTM.
	  
	  Eng resources are as useful to GTM as they are to your product. Weâ€™ve built 1000s of reusable templates, landing pages and top of funnel tools for marketing to drive programmatic SEO. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CuffeJamie/status/1481348836060581888))
	- 9. Short-term impatience with a long-term view.
	  
	  Use customer deadlines, product reviews and GTM timelines to your advantage to reach your goals faster. Momentum drives product velocity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CuffeJamie/status/1481348837046304769))
