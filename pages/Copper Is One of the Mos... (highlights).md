	- Copper is one of the most exciting metals to study.
	  
	  We're obsessed with "Electrifying" the world.
	  
	  But we have completely ignored the MASSIVE metals supply/demand imbalance.
	  
	  This creates one of the most asymmetric bets in all of markets.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ Background: S&P Global Research Report
	  
	  This thread analyzes S&P Global's July 2022 Copper report.
	  
	  The report's objective is twofold:
	  
	  1) Understand future copper demand from ESG, Electrification, and "Green" Energy.
	  
	  2) Determine how supply will respond to demand.
	  
	  Let's go!

	- 2/ Why Copper Matters
	  
	  Copper was one of the first metals extracted (8,000 BC). 
	  
	  The metal has many attractive attributes: 
	  
	  â€¢ Easily stretched, casted, and shaped
	  
	  â€¢ Excellent alloying properties
	  
	  â€¢ Great at conducting heat/electricity
	  
	  Remember conducting electricity!

	- 3/ How Do We Get Copper?
	  
	  A miner's goal is to take ore with 1% copper and turn it into a cathode that's 99.95% pure copper. 
	  
	  This requires smelting and refining to convert low-grade ore into pure copper. 
	  
	  Important: All the "easy" high-grade copper has been mined.

	- 3b/ Where Do We Get All Our Copper?
	  
	  Copper is unique in that its production is highly concentrated between Chile & Peru. 
	  
	  Countries ranked by total copper reserve base:
	  
	  â€¢ Chile
	  
	  â€¢ Australia
	  
	  â€¢ Democratic Rep. Congo
	  
	  â€¢ Mainland China
	  
	  â€¢ USA

	- 4/ DEMAND EQUATION: The Great Electrification
	  
	  World leaders want zero-carbon by 2050. 
	  
	  To do that, copper demand will skyrocket in the following sectors:
	  
	  â€¢ Automotive
	  
	  â€¢ Power transmission & distribution
	  
	  â€¢ Power generation
	  
	  Let's review each sector's demand story ...

	- 4a/ Automotive: More EVs = More Copper
	  
	  EVs require 2.5x more copper than internal combustion engines. 
	  
	  Battery packs are responsible for 90% of copper demand in larger vehicles (18-wheelers).
	  
	  Charging stations, harnesses, capacitors, and e-motors all require copper.

	- 4b/ Power Transmission & Distribution (T&D)
	  
	  Nearly all electrical wiring uses copper. It accounts for 20% of total demand.
	  
	  Four factors will drive T&D demand: 
	  
	  1) Increased renewable electricity generation
	  
	  2) Supporting infrastructure
	  
	  3) Replacing aging lines
	  
	  4) Resiliency

	- 5/ Power Generation
	  
	  Green power consumes 2-5x more copper than coal/natural gas power.
	  
	  These power sources include:
	  
	  â€¢ Offshore wind
	  
	  â€¢ Solar PV
	  
	  â€¢ Battery Storage
	  
	  â€¢ Onshore Wind
	  
	  â€¢ Tidal & Concentrated Solar
	  
	  Offshore wind is most copper intensive.

	- 6/ Recap: Copper Technology Growth Rates
	  
	  Copper demand will grow ~8% annually due to The Great Electrification.
	  
	  Check out annual growth metrics by technology:
	  
	  â€¢ Offshore Wind: 24%
	  
	  â€¢ Battery Storage: 22%
	  
	  â€¢ Autos: 14%
	  
	  Remember, this is IN ADDITION to normal demand sources!

	- 7/ Copper Demand: Where We Stand
	  
	  Total copper demand will double from 25MMt in 2021 to 49MMt by 2035. 
	  
	  This is due to The Great Electrification + Normal Copper demand.
	  
	  Where will this growth come from?
	  
	  â€¢ China
	  
	  â€¢ India
	  
	  â€¢ Vietnam
	  
	  â€¢ Mexico
	  
	  What does this mean for Supply?

	- 8/ SUPPLY EQUATION: The Inevitable Shortage
	  
	  The supply equation to meet future demand is bleak.
	  
	  ESG won't let us open new mines.
	  
	  But even if they did, it would take decades to come online.
	  
	  THEN we'd need 300Kt/year for 30 years (95% utilize).
	  
	  That requires $500B in capex.

	- 9/ The Cure: High Prices
	  
	  Copper prices must rise to meet Electrification Demand. 
	  
	  High prices make high cost operations economical and incentivize more recycling. 
	  
	  Here's the crazy part: There STILL wouldn't be enough copper supply even w/ high prices and 96% utilization!

	- 10/ The Implication: Massive Shortages
	  
	  We've never gotten close to full capacity. So the odds favor lower supply. 
	  
	  This would create a ~2MMt - 10MMt supply deficit by 2035. 
	  
	  The largest supply deficit ever was 2.5%.
	  
	  We're looking at a 4-20% supply deficit.

	- 11/ HOW TO PLAY: Potential Copper Trades
	  
	  There are a few ways to play this trade: 
	  
	  1) Copper futures 
	  
	  2) Large copper miners 
	  
	  3) Junior miners
	  
	  If you're playing miners, you must stress: 
	  
	  â€¢ Geology quality
	  
	  â€¢ Management
	  
	  â€¢ Geography/geopolitics ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/marketplunger1/status/1640738888632205316))
	- 12/ CONCLUSION: The Great Electrification & Supply Shortage
	  
	  Copper demand is set to explode due to EVs, upgraded power infrastructure, and renewable energy power.
	  
	  Supply can't match demand even in most ambitious scenario.
	  
	  The cure is high prices to spur production/innovation.
