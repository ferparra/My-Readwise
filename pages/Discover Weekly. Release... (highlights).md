		- **Note**: Thread
	- I'm currently reading Computing Taste" written by Nick Seaver.
	  
	  This book provides a detailed look at the complexity of modern music recommendation algorithms.
	  
	  Below you'll learn some major takeaways on how these algorithms developed and how they know our music taste. (2/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SammersETH/status/1612999013116301312))
	- Start of Recommender Algorithms
	  
	  ðŸ”ºEarly algorithms were based on user rankings
	  ðŸ”ºAlgorithm suggests songs based on similar taste rankings
	  ðŸ”ºRoot Mean Square Error (RSME) measured the recommended ranking's proximity to user's actual ranking after consumption - accuracy (3/

	- Move from Recommender to behavior-based algorithms
	  
	  ðŸ”ºModern algorithms use data on user behavior instead of ranking
	  ðŸ”ºExamples: when a user clicks past a song, how they scroll past ads, and which playlists they frequently click on. (4/

	- Importance of Good User Interface
	  
	  ðŸ”ºFocusing too much on accuracy can neglect user experience
	  ðŸ”ºGood UI design crucial for creating positive user experience (5/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SammersETH/status/1612999026336739328))
	- Hardest Part is New Users
	  
	  ðŸ”ºNew users have no preference data
	  ðŸ”ºCommon technique is to show new users with most popular music then learn from how they interact w/ that
	  ðŸ”ºWhy platforms ask new users for their music preferences upon signing up (6/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SammersETH/status/1612999030854021122))
	- Complexities of algorithms
	  
	  ðŸ”ºModern music recommendation systems use a combination of different algorithms & techniques to make personalized recommendations
	  ðŸ”ºThese include collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, natural language processing, and other methods (7/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SammersETH/status/1612999032900837377))
	- ðŸ”ºCollaborative filtering: makes recommendations based on the listening habits of other users who have similar preferences
	  ðŸ”ºContent-based filtering: makes recommendations based on the characteristics of the music, such as genre, tempo, and lyrics (8/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SammersETH/status/1612999039578177537))
