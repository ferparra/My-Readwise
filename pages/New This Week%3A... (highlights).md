	- New this week:
	                  
	         ðŸ“ˆ  Project Updates
	  
	  We are introducing a brand-new concept to Linear called Project Updates. These are short status reports that keep everyone informed about the progress and health of your projects.

	- Project Updates consist of two components:
	  
	  1) A health indicator that provides a high-level signal of the current state of the project â†“
	  
	     ðŸŸ¢  On Track
	     ðŸŸ¡  At Risk
	     ðŸ”´  Off track
	  
	  2) A rich text description for in-depth information on the progress of the project â†“

	- Project Updates will appear directly on the Roadmap, giving you a clear and structured progress overview of all your team's projects at a single glance.
	  
	  You can also automatically share updates on Slack for enhanced visibility.

	- Project Updates can be posted by any member of the project.
	  
	  We recommend a weekly cadence for these updates to keep everyone up-to-date.
	  
	  To get into the habit of posting updates regularly, you can set up automatic reminders that show up in your Inbox at a specified interval. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/linear/status/1545060423480668163))
