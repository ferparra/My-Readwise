	- Today and yesterday I taught a course on Mapping for Product Managers - a @mindtheproduct course. It's all about the importance of systems thinking and visualising complexity.
	  
	  It was the first time I had taught this specific course. Some thoughts ðŸ§µ ðŸ‘‡
	- It was a surprise to me how infrequently the students mapped.
	  
	  Surprising because whenever I don't understand something, I draw it. I've done this instinctively throughout my career. Often, I ask other people to map something for me.
	- To me, mapping has 3 main benefits: 
	  1) It builds a shared understanding of the problem, so that...
	  2) ...your team can figure out what to do next
	  3) It helps to align other people in the org and build relationships.
	  
	  Some detail on these:
	- 1) ~60% of people are visual learners. Even if *you* aren't a visual learner, most people are. Mapping a complex journey, process, experience etc. improves understanding and memory assimilation if done visually. 
	  
	  Don't assume from a conversation you're on the same page. Map.

	- 2. I've certainly worked with many designers - and some PMs - in the past who LOVE to map. A beautiful, comprehensive map. And then... nothing.
	  
	  Mapping is often seen as the end-goal. It isn't. The actions you take having created the map are the goal...

	- As the PM, it's your role to continually be driving actions from any mapping session and throughout the process.
	- 3. If you only map in your own team, you are missing a big opportunity to build bridges with, and get insights from, people in your org. 
	  
	  I *always* have a wildcard at a mapping session - someone from sales, finance, ops - either not involved or only indirectly...

	- They provide a unique perspective. What's more, I've never seen execs happier than having just participated in a big mapping session to visualise a system. (I think it makes them feel like they're doing real work for a change ðŸ˜‰)
	- I've even held mapping sessions with the goal of building bridges with teams where we had a poor relationship. (A bit like the trick that asking someone for advice is a great way to get them to like you). 
	  
	  They appreciate being included and that their input is seen as valuable.
	- We also talked about encountering resistance to mapping in an org. 
	  
	  This largely comes down to an org's mindset toward problem-solving in general: false certainty stemming from a lack of humility or oversimplification of a system.

	- What to do when you encounter resistance? It's tough but some tips that might help:
	  
	  1) Start small, start simple.
	  2) Make the map public, and talk about it often. 
	  4) Embed mapping into processes and rituals.
	  
	  Some details on this...

	- 1. The temptation is to 'map the whole world'. But if you're just getting started or facing resistance, slice off something manageable first. 
	  
	  Get a ball rolling with several lo-fi but still useful maps, building up to hi-fi, tougher maps requiring input from more teams.
	- 2. Host a brown bag lunch, present at quarterly updates, create a 2-min video - whatever opportunities you have. 
	  
	  Critically, when you take an action from your map, report back on the metrics, and *reference the map*. "We mapped, then we did this. These are the results."

	- When remote, bring it up any time you're discussing that system. Share it often in the relevant channels.
	  
	  In a physical environment, make it portable. Carry it with you to meetings. Invite people to comment on it or ask questions about it with a sticky.

	- 3. Have a release that impacts the map? Make updating the map part of the [[acceptance criteria]]. Or review it before planning sessions. Or show it before [[sprint planning]]. Or make it part of onboarding. Or all of the above.
	  
	  It's harder to forget when it's part of your [[process]].
	- Visualising complexity through mapping is an extremely useful skill to have. 
	  
	  Like anything though, it's a muscle that needs consistent training. Don't expect to be perfect if you're just starting out.
