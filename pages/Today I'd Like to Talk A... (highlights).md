	- Today I'd like to talk about @RealityCards, the NFT prediction market for real-life events.
	  
	  Disclaimer: this is one of my most favourite crypto-related projects, so I'm not exactly objective in this thread. 
	  
	  You certainly don't need the ðŸ§µ to guess it's a thread, do you? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChiTimesChi/status/1445108839800397826))

	- I assume most of you have already heard of the regular betting markets. Place a bet, get fixed odds. 
	  
	  Say, you bet $100 with odds of 2.2 (+120) on your favorite team to win. If you team wins, you receive $220, making a profit of $120. If they don't win, you lose your $100. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChiTimesChi/status/1445108841083904001))
	- "The odds are fixed" means that once you placed a bet, the amount you receive (should your team win) won't change no matter what.
	  
	  The odds themselves, however, can change before the game begins. Bookmakers are usually setting odds based on the demand-supply model. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChiTimesChi/status/1445108842174431242))
	- Imagine: one of the key players in your team is injured. People will be betting more on the opponent team. 
	  
	  The bookmaker will balance that by increasing your team's odds, say, from 2.2 (+120) to 3.0 (+200). At the same time, the winning odds for the opponent will be decreased. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChiTimesChi/status/1445108843483066375))
	- What if you removed the bookmaker out of the picture? Let the users decide how likely each outcome is, the decentralised way. 
	  
	  One way to do it is to replace "fixed odds" with auction-styled betting, and this is exactly what @RealityCards is doing. With an NFT twist, of course. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChiTimesChi/status/1445108844640624642))
	- Example time. You want to bet on the upcoming match, and there are three outcomes: "Your team wins", "Your team loses", "Draw".
	  
	  Each of the outcomes is represented by a single NFT. Initially, no one owns them. The market for the match is opened a few days before the match. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChiTimesChi/status/1445108845785673743))
	- Anyone can obtain the outcome NFT once the market is open, by renting it. 
	  
	  The cost of rent is 1 USDC/hour, if there's no active renter. Otherwise you have to pay at least 10% more than the current renter. If you do so, the NFT is transferred from the current renter to you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChiTimesChi/status/1445108846930788358))
	- If your deposit runs out, the NFT goes back to the second highest bidder. Or you can cancel your rent yourself with the same effect.
	  
	  Effectively, there's a constant price discovery for each and every outcome while the betting market is open. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChiTimesChi/status/1445108848205828100))
	- When the market for the match is closed (usually this happens before the match begins), the total pot is all rental payments combined.
	  
	  Everyone, who has been renting an NFT for the winning outcome, will receive a portion of the total pot. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChiTimesChi/status/1445108849468313604))
	- But it doesn't matter how much money have you spent while renting. The only thing that matters is how long the winning NFT was in your possession. 
	  
	  If you have been renting it for 10% of the market duration, you will receive 10% of the total pot. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChiTimesChi/status/1445108850596593670))
	- This means you can rent a winning NFT and still lose money, if you have been paying too big of a price. 
	  
	  Or you can rent it, when the price is low, and get a huge payout for a very little low price. Timing is everything! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChiTimesChi/status/1445108851825541120))
	- What happens with the NFT, which was going back and forth during the betting market? It goes to the person, who has been renting it the longest. 
	  
	  Once again, it doesn't matter how much you spent. What matters is the amount of time you have been renting the NFT. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChiTimesChi/status/1445108852895064072))
	- This gives extra incentive to rent the NFT, even if you don't believe in the outcome. Just do it for the art, it's really impressing!

	- TLDR: users are renting the outcome NFTs via auction. Renters of the "winning outcome NFT" receive winnings based on how long they have been renting it. 
	  
	  All longest renters receive NFT for the outcome (doesn't matter if it is a winning outcome or not). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChiTimesChi/status/1445108855285813250))
	- @RealityCards is now in the open beta. I only described the basics, and left out lots of things being developed now. 
	  
	  I can only wonder how different RealityCards will be when it is officially launched. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChiTimesChi/status/1445108856506372099))
