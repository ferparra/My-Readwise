	  You can now create a date filter mixing predefined settings and custom dates and only show the start/end dates when "Custom" is selected ðŸ¥³

	- 2. Create a date filter calculation.
	  
	  Depending on the user selection, it will filter the date in different ways.

	  Name that field "Custom selected."
	  
	  This will return true (if "custom" is selected) or false otherwise.
