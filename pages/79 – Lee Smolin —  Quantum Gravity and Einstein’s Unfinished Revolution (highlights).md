	- Is Space Time Fundamental Or Emergent?
	  
	  Summary:
	  Time is the continual creation of events from existing event. So if there is no event, there is nothing to time. As far down as you we have e real yess, as real as real it could be. i think that time is fundamental, and, quote, goes all the way down,. space does not. And the combination of them we use in generalactivity that we call space time also does not.

	  Speaker 2
	  So, okay, we're going to allow me to linger on that. So the universe has events. Events cause other events. This is the idea of causality. Okay, so that's real.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  That's in my interview is real. Or hypothesis or the theories that I have been working to develop, make that assumption.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So space time, you said four dimensional spaces, kind of the location of things in time is whatever the heck time is. And you're saying that space time is both space and time are emergent and not fundamental. No. Sorry, before you correct me, what does it mean to be fundamental or emergent?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Fundamental means it's part of the description as far down as you go. We have this question. It's real.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Yes. As real as real it could be.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So I think that time is fundamental and quote goes all the way down. And space does not. And the combination of them we use in general relativity that we call space time also does not.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  But what is time then?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I think that time, the activity of time is the continual creation of events from existing events.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So if there's no events, there's no time.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Then there's not only no time, there's no nothing. So I believe the universe has a history which goes to the past. I believe the future does not exist. There's a notion of a present and a notion of the past. And the past consists of is a story about events that took place to our past.
