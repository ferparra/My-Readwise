	- Masterclass is raising new funding at a $2.5B valuation. 
	  
	  The platform's secret sauce: incredible SEO, which uses the power of "second order questions" to drive free traffic to its site. 
	  
	  Here's a breakdown 🧵 https://t.co/QYOloCmrkZ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1379938847115542529))
	- 1/ The Masterclass website got ~10m visits in March w/ 61% of traffic coming via search (nearly all of it organic). https://t.co/rh45S4KlAt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1379938849904750592))
	- 2/ The key to this organic search traffic? 
	  
	  Masterclass’ hundreds of high-quality articles including pieces on: 
	  
	  • Food
	  • Design 
	  • Music 
	  • Business
	  • Writing https://t.co/eRfhBPiNhr ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1379938853117550593))
	- 3/ Masterclass appears at the top of Google searches for:
	  
	   🥨“what are pretzels”
	  🖊 “types of poems”
	   🥄“how many teaspoons in a tablespoon”
	   🎶“song structure”
	   📙“how to write an autobiography”
	  
	  These five key search terms combine for 500k+ monthly Google searches. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1379938854384271362))
	- 4/ Let’s dig into one example:

	- 5/ This “teaspoon” article definitely answers the search query.
	  
	  BUT, it is also riddled with calls-to-action for Masterclass courses related to cooking (eg Gordon Ramsay, Madison Bottura). https://t.co/JGGSMQLbje ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1379938860914761729))
	- 6/ This is where "second-order questions" come into play. 
	  
	  Example: 
	  
	  Let’s say you sell washable rugs online.
	  
	  A typical FIRST ORDER question you might rank for is “best pet friendly rug”.
	  
	  A SECOND ORDER question you should target is “best rug shampooer for pets”. https://t.co/6uL80zcaGd ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1379938864693866499))
	- 7/ Why do SECOND ORDER questions work? 
	  
	  Because you’re targeting a similar audience who is one step away from wanting your product.
	  
	  And @masterclass is brilliantly building a content library around these audience-related searches! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1379938866082185217))
	- 8/ This knowledge was shared to me by @ahogan, who DEF knows the search game.
