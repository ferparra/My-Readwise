	- Interestingly, this dichotomy isn’t limited to human cognition. It’s also a key thing that people fundamentally miss about AI:
	  
	  Even though our AI models were trained by reading the whole internet, that training mostly enhances its reasoning abilities—not how much it knows. And so, the performance of today’s AI is constrained by its lack of knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwyk06he5e3zyvrk9701fe2))
	- Knowledge databases are as important to AI progress as foundational models ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwymvmd09k67z74gsnke5sg))
	- People who organize, store, and catalog their own thinking and reading will have a leg up in an AI-driven world. They can make those resources available to the model and use it to enhance the intelligence and relevance of its responses.

	- Vector databases allow you to easily index and store large amounts of information, and then quickly query for similar pieces of information to give to your model when you need to. They’re so common in AI apps that it’s likely almost every demo you’ve tried over the last few months has included a vector database for some part of their functionality.

	- Vectors are incredibly important for all sorts of previous-generation machine learning algorithms like [recommendation systems](https://every.to/napkin-math/recommendation-algorithims-are-good-sort-of). As a result, the database tooling from providers like Pinecone isn’t purpose built for large language models like ChatGPT. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwyqh83mt9x9b70t4qhzwbv))
	- We’re already seeing newer alternatives springing up that wrap some [business logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic) around the database layer to make it easier for AI developers to do common tasks. Some of these are developer libraries like Langchain and LlamaIndex. And some seem to be more fully featured developer tools like [Metal](https://www.getmetal.io?utm_source=every) and [Baseplate](https://www.baseplate.ai?utm_source=every) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwypy45935g4nj2ypy0kfkr))
