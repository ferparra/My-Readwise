	  We're back, Star Talk sports edition. How the focus of mind can enhance or subtract from any attempt to perform at your peak, be it in everyday life or in any sports venue. And we've got Heather Berlin, our resident neuroscientist as our guest today. So, Heather, when people have egos, this is, they think, maybe they think exactly what they should of themselves, but often when we say someone's got an ego, they think more highly of themselves. Can that have a benefit to their performance? Is this something that can manifest in game time, like under pressure? Does it work in reverse? Yeah, if you don't think you're good, do you end up performing worse than you can or should have? Just wondering.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  This is a very complex question, actually, and it touches upon some 40 and things as well. But when we say ego, you can think of it like it's your sense of self, and some people can have an inflated sense of self, some people can have a low sense of self and devalue themselves. The ideal is to be somewhere in the middle. Now, to have self-confidence is positive, so I think that will help your performance, to feel, I'm going to go out there and I know I can do this, I've done this before, and it's sort of like positive self-talk, and self-confidence is good. But when you get to these people with the impolated ego, there's something called a vulnerable narcissist. And these are people that have a lot of bluster, but it's really to cover up their insecurity and vulnerability. And so I, when somebody is too over the top about themselves, to me, that is a sign that they're actually very insecure. So the secure people with a very healthy ego don't have to over advertise it. They just have a sense of almost peace and stability within themselves.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So Heather, are there tools of the psychologist, psychiatrist, to manage a person's ego? Or is it you just talk them down from that? And you have to talk people up if they think lowly of themselves, right? Yeah. What are your tactics?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Okay, so there are a couple things. First of all, when you get people on really high on the narcissist scale, they're very difficult to treat. There's something called narcissistic personality disorder, which basically is a lifetime disorder. And they often don't come for treatment because they don't think they have a problem. Everyone else, they have a problem, but they don't. Exactly. So they don't want to change. So they're very difficult to treat. It's easier to lift someone up who has low self-esteem. But one thing that we do work with people on is when they want to keep their head in the game, or whether it's playing a game or giving a talk or whatever, is to when you're in the moment to become less self-aware. So there's a part of your brain, this doors a lot or a prefrontal cortex that has to do with your sense of self. And if you're trying to perform and you're constantly thinking, how am I doing? How am I throwing the ball? What are people thinking? That messes up your performance. And so the whole idea is to try to decrease your sense of self and be really in the flow state and be in the moment and then you perform your best.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  That's why a lot of coaches will tell you, and they don't mean it as a cliche. Go have fun. Like get out there and play the game and have fun because in doing so, you take yourself out of that equation. If you're just really enjoying yourself, you're probably going to have a pretty good performance, a very good performance. Plus the word flow is a big word today in everything.
