	  Key takeaways:
	  (* The beta paradox is a term that refers to the tendency of humans to be more likely to act in a way that will lead to a worse situation, rather than a better one, when making decisions., * The beta paradox is often referred to as the "paradox of choice"., * The beta paradox can be a challenge for individuals, as it can be difficult to force oneself out of a situation that is not bad enough to compel them to leave.)

	  I know you I was just thinking about something I shared with you and you said you'd seen already. I don't think Justin had saw it, but did you see the I forget what it's called. It's it's called a paradox a certain type. Oh, Pareto principle. What is it called? Is it the Pareto principle? Is that what it's called? I don't remember. No, no, no, not the 80 20. This was what Chris Williamson said. I think on Joe Rogan show when he was on there, he talked about where if like so he gave an example of if something is less than a mile away, we lean towards walking. That's right. If something is two miles or further away, we make the decision to to drive in the car and he was explaining that on how we believe numb. Yes, yes, and how how how how often we get stuck in that place assumes and that's all the beta paradox and that we would actually be beta paradox beta paradox that we'd actually be better off in a worse circumstance because the worst circumstance would more likely move forward to get out of it. I mean, I can totally relate to this. I and I say this when I talk back when I when I get questions on interviews of like my my career path and stuff. When I talk about my last four years at 24 our fitness, I talk about them as almost like four wasted years of like there was four years there where I I knew I probably should leave but it sucks so bad that you that's right. It didn't suck bad enough for me to to make the decision and then of course making that decision was scary, hard. I was definitely challenged by the gates but then ultimately led to the one of the best decisions I ever made in my life.

	  And it's like how many people are stuck in that place whether it be it's not bad enough to force them out, right? ([Time 0:40:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/593167b4-2914-4dbf-8f3e-0aa5b58be692))
