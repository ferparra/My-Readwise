document_note:: The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham promotes a strong-minded and analytical approach to investing in stocks that emphasizes minimizing risk by never overpaying for stocks and protecting oneself against losses. The text also advocates for the practice of dollar-cost averaging for an ordinary investor and for recognizing that speculation is unavoidable in many common-stock situations. Finally, the text stresses the importance of understanding the underlying businesses of a stock and avoiding overconfidence in one's own judgment.

- Warren Buffett has combined Benjamin Graham's "margin of safety" and detachment from the market with an innovative emphasis on future growth. He looks for "franchise" companies with strong consumer brands, easily understandable businesses, robust financial health, and near-monopolies in their markets. He likes to buy stocks when there is bad news or a scandal, and he wants to see managers who set and meet realistic goals, build their businesses from within, allocate capital wisely, and not pay themselves huge jackpots of stock options. Buffett insists on steady and sustainable growth in earnings, so the company will be worth more in the future than it is today.

	- Unless you are confident in your analytical abilities and are willing to spend hours analyzing stocks, a [dollar-cost averaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging) approach into [low-fee indexed funds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vanguard_Group) is the way to go ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4pwg2mg3dfmjdc7wnz4gpc))
	- In the past we have made a basic distinction between two kinds of investors to whom this book was addressed â€” the "defensive" and the "enterprising." The defensive (or passive) investor will place his chief emphasis on the avoidance of serious mistakes or losses. His second aim will be freedom from effort, annoyance, and the need for making frequent decisions. The determining trait of the enterprising (or active, or aggressive) investor is his willingness to devote time and care to the selection of securities that are both sound and more attractive than the average. Over many decades an enterprising investor of this sort could expect a worthwhile reward for his extra skill and effort, in the form of a better average ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4pwwsbz0n2yrekpgg9q6y5))
		- **Note**: In this book, we talk about two kinds of investors - the 'defensive' investor and the 'enterprising' investor. The defensive investor is someone who wants to avoid mistakes and losses, and they don't want to put in a lot of effort. The enterprising investor is someone who wants to put in time and effort to find stocks that are good and better than average. If the enterprising investor spends many years doing this, they can expect to get a reward for their extra work.
	- Viewed logically, the decision of whether to own stocks today has nothing to do with how much money you might have lost by owning them a few years ago. When stocks are priced reasonably enough to give you future growth, then you should own them, regardless of the losses they may have cost you in the recent past. That's all the more true when bond yields are low, reducing the future returns on income producing investments ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4pyfn55z1t4rk6cqrmh0zw))
	- Once you lose 95% of your money, you have to gain 1,900% just to get back to where you started. First rule of investing, do not lose money ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4pz7pr1vn2nbnkcw9ejp66))
	- Outright [speculation](http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/speculation/) is neither illegal, immoral, nor (for most people) fattening to the pocketbook. More than that, some speculation is necessary and unavoidable, for in many common-stock situations there are substantial possibilities of both profit and loss, and the risks therein must be assumed by someone. There is intelligent speculation as there is intelligent investing. **But there are many ways in which speculation may be unintelligent. Of these the foremost are: (1) speculating when you think you are investing; (2) speculating seriously instead of as a pastime, when you lack proper knowledge and skill for it; and (3) risking more money in speculation than you can afford to lose.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4pzw60vt5zch957nahs3vv))

		- **Note**: Speculation is like a game. It is not bad or illegal, and it can make you money, but sometimes it can be done in a bad way. If you think you are investing, but you are really speculating, that is bad. If you try to play the game without knowing how, that is bad too. And if you risk more money than you can afford to lose, that is also bad.
	- For most of us, 10% of our overall wealth is the maximum permissible amount to put at speculative risk. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4q1n55g306zfn8x9jcthm5))

	- The more the investor depends on his [portfolio](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp) and the [income](http://www.investopedia.com/university/safety-and-income/?rp=i) therefrom, the more necessary it is for him to guard against the unexpected and the disconcerting in this part of his life.

	- I suggest that you [rebalance](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/05/051105.asp) every six months, no more and no less, on easy-to-remember dates like New Year's and the Fourth of July. The beauty of this periodic rebalancing is that it forces you to base your investing decisions on a simple, objective standard-Do I now own more of this asset than my plan calls for?-instead of the sheer guesswork of where interest rates are heading or whether you think the Dow is about to drop dead ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4q3g7hqjn2n7g1h0qqb690))

	- If you are not willing to go to the minimal effort of reading the proxy and making basic comparisons of financial health across five years' worth of annual reports, then you are too defensive to be buying individual stocks at all. Get yourself out of the stock-picking business and into an index fund, where you belong. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4q4j23fy7b6hr3q4cm25q2))
