	  Well, I don't think about this too often or actually I don't think about this at all. I am as I am and as I've always been. But yeah, I get this a lot that people write to me and the things that they say is that you're inspirational. And I think also, I mean, lifting people up so that they can do their work better. I mean, it's also about delegation, but it's also about trusting people. And sometimes it's very, very hard to, you know, delegate and really trust the people to do that work, not to take it from him or her and just I will do this myself because eventually I will be responsible. I mean, when something goes wrong, it always comes to my level. And it would be so easy to say he or she didn't do her or his job correctly and I don't really mind. But it is that I have to trust them. And if people feel that you trust them, they also take the responsibility to do their work assignments better because they see that you trust them.
