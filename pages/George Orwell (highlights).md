document_note:: George Orwell's 1984 is a cautionary tale about a future in which Big Brother controls all aspects of people's lives through brainwashing, surveillance, and censorship. Winston Smith, a citizen of this dystopia, is eventually broken by the Thought Police and ultimately comes to accept Big Brother's power. The novel illustrates the dangers of totalitarianism, emphasizing the fragility of individuality and free will in a world where facts can be altered and the past is no longer reliable. It is a warning against allowing governments to become too powerful, as well as a reminder of the importance of beauty and hope in a bleak world.
