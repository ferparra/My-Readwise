document_note:: ChatGPT is a neural network that has been trained to generate human-language text and distinguish between words. It is an artificial intelligence system that is able to “capture the essence” of human language and thinking by relying on neural nets which can “interpolate” and “generalize” between examples. It has 175 billion weights, allowing it to make a “reasonable model” of text humans write. It is able to use words to create “neural-net-friendly” collections of numbers, and it has the potential to use a computational language that is understandable to humans.

- The voodoo begins to creep in when we pick lower-ranked words at random instead of always picking the highest-ranked word.

	- One might think it should be the “highest-ranked” word (i.e. the one to which the highest “probability” was assigned). But this is where a bit of voodoo begins to creep in. Because for some reason—that maybe one day we’ll have a scientific-style understanding of—if we always pick the highest-ranked word, we’ll typically get a very “flat” essay, that never seems to “show any creativity” (and even sometimes repeats word for word). But if sometimes (at random) we pick lower-ranked words, we get a “more interesting” essay. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsa66fx0jtf8t9a1jxarqpjz))
	- The first thing to explain is that what ChatGPT is always fundamentally trying to do is to produce a “reasonable continuation” of whatever text it’s got so far, where by “reasonable” we mean “what one might expect someone to write after seeing what people have written on billions of webpages, etc.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs9vweh286kncseby81d86s9))
