	- Why do we need Technical Engineering Managers?
	  
	  Below is a list of Lesser-Known Reasons why we need More Technical Engineering Managers:
	  
	  1- Prevent team members from underperforming due to a lack of opportunities! How? ðŸ‘‡

		- **Note**: Thread
	- Failing to identify if the task/feature/problem at hand is complex enough to require a Senior or a Staff Eng (or if a Junior Eng can do it) leads to teams overloaded by overqualified engineers that frequently step on each other feet.

	- 2- Proactively manages low performers!
	  
	  Frequently review/inspect the quality & cadence/throughput/size of ongoing pull requests (and other contributions) for each team member and give specific & concrete feedback on what they need to do to reach their expected performance level.

	- 3- Provide timely feedback on soft and hard skills!
	  
	  Knows what kind of feedback to give (and expectations to set) to engineers at different levels of seniority to grow technically and behaviorally. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thiagoghisi/status/1629874716591763460))
	- 4- Save everyone's time!
	  
	  Can represent the technical perspective in most meetings & business decisions without requiring senior ICs to join. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thiagoghisi/status/1629874719460818944))
	- 5- Reduce scope!
	  
	  Can evaluate technical solutions for potential unintended risks and common failure modes and reduce as much scope as possible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thiagoghisi/status/1629874722253963264))
	- 6- Optimize costs & performance!
	  
	  Understands the main drivers of cloud & infrastructure and software costs, monitors them and pivots execution to address them as needed.
	  
	  Understands the major causes of latency & the biggest single points of failures (SPOF) on the architecture. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thiagoghisi/status/1629874725060247555))
	- 7- Proactively prioritize the highest leverage opportunities!
	  
	  Understands the biggest productivity bottlenecks codebase-wise & highest leverage investment opportunities regarding technical debt/migrations. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thiagoghisi/status/1629874727677497344))
	- 8- Debug processes & rituals when the team cannot deliver and/or gets often blocked or moving in circles. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thiagoghisi/status/1629874730525229059))
	- 9- Is able to & participates (even if only once a month or once a quarter) in the on-call schedule for their teams. 
	  
	  On-call is a great opportunity to learn about monitoring/alerting/platforms/scalability & all containers (as defined by c4model) (both weak/strong points). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thiagoghisi/status/1629922097169408001))
	- 10- Can independently consume and contribute to RFCs and technical documentation that touch their domains.
	  
	  Frequently contributes to the Long-Term Vision & Strategy of the Architecture & Platforms. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thiagoghisi/status/1629922792136232964))
