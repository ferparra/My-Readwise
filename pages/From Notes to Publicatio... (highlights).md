	- The first (and hardest) step in building a publication is to create the argument (or "line of thinking").
	  
	  Having linked notes about:
	- Well taken notes even provide paragraphs for a first draft.
	  
	  But what are good notes for the purpose of publication?
	  
	  Let's talk about note types.. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1422895677168881665))
	- I use 4 types of notes:
	- Atomic notes represent a single core idea.
	  
	  These ideas can be:
	- Evergreen notes are notes that are constantly evolving with new information.
	  
	  Some atomic notes may be a single paragraph, others will evolve into long Evergreen notes.
	  
	  Evergreen notes would eventually look like Wikipedia pages with content and links to multiple other notes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1422895681182834694))
	- Map of Content notes aggregate notes related to a given concept.
	  
	  It is a contextualised list of links to other notes.
	  
	  It can also provide associated text to each link or group of links.

	- Navigational notes serve the purpose of navigating my Knowledge Base.
	  
	  They lead me from my Home note into my atomic notes via link navigation.

	- Two important things about my note system:
	  
	  1. One note may have two types at same time (e.g. MoC and Evergreen)
	  
	  2. I do not formally classify, tag or categorise them into these types beforehand. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1422895700740820992))
	- I follow the @NickMilo's Idea Emergency flow.
	  
	  "Let the structure emerge within my knowledge base, rather than try to organise everything beforehand into a rigid structure"

	- How to create publications based on this system of notes? https://t.co/SdMGv41a5Y ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1422895711939661826))
	- First, the argument is a sequence of ideas leading from a premise to a conclusion.
	  
	  Individual ideas are within the Atomic Notes.
	  
	  The argument is then a Map of Contents note with the sequence of atomic notes that build the argument. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1422895714640801794))
	- The argument MoC may also contain additional text explaining the connection/causal relation between the atomic notes.
	  
	  It forms the skeleton for the first draft of the publication. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1422895715915796482))
	- Academic arguments are usually complex and form branches.
	  
	  The next step is to organise the argument into an easy to understand presentation.
	  
	  Here we break down the Argument MoC content into paper sections (e.g Introduction, Related Work, etc) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1422895717278945286))
	- I like to create a MoC/Navigational note representing the paper itself.
	  
	  It contains the sections of the paper, the links to argument pieces relevant to that section (coming from the Argument MoC) and, if I wish, a first draft built from the argument notes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1422895718751260676))
	- I have tried drafting within my note system and drafting outside. 
	  
	  I am not happy with either due to the tools I use, but I will keep investigating this. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1422895719975997440))
	- The Creation step is still the weakest part of my academic workflow, so it will still change quite a bit. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1422895721217409034))
	- In summary, I create a publication by building an argument sequence based on my current notes.
	  
	  Without properly taken notes, the whole system crumbles and I fall back into the "blank page" problem. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1422895722467405826))
