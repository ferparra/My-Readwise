	- Today @JoinFreehold and members of the Stacks community are announcing CityCoins (https://t.co/y1GN8LjGNy) with MiamiCoin ($MIA) being the first CityCoin.
	  
	  CityCoins let you invest in your favorite city while earning for yourself.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- CityCoins run on Stacks (STX). Theyâ€™re mined by forwarding STX to a smart contract on BTC.
	  
	  30% of the STX goes to a wallet reserved by the city.
	  
	  70% goes to CityCoin holders. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatrickWStanley/status/1400147246671273987))
	- The city can use that money to serve its citizensâ€“â€“think infrastructure, city events, recruiting startups, and more.
	  
	  CityCoin holders can stack their coins to earn STX & BTC. 
	  
	  Everybody wins. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatrickWStanley/status/1400147247849906178))
	- CityCoins can also incentivize residents via:
	  
	  Rewards for community service
	  Building apps for the city
	  Discounts for hodling

	- Itâ€™s also entirely possible a personâ€™s effective STX contribution as a function of hodling becomes larger than the annual tax collected from them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatrickWStanley/status/1400147254443343874))
	- With CityCoins, possibilities abound. 
	  
	  Theyâ€™re programmable, so developers can create apps that use them for access control, trading, lending, and smart contract execution. 
	  
	  The more people use them, the higher the rewards, and the more likely others will join in. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatrickWStanley/status/1400147255630336002))
	- $MIA is the first CityCoin. Why the Magic City?
	  
	  Itâ€™s a powerhouse among major US cities, esp. in crypto and blockchain tech.
	  
	  Devs and entrepreneurs are tapping into its network effects, supportive government, and culture of constant evolution and disruption. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatrickWStanley/status/1400147257404518401))
	- CityCoins will unlock millions in new funding for cities and holders alike.
	  
	  All that mayors have to do is #pickupthebag to access their cityâ€™s wallet.  
	  
	  This is just the start. A move from municipal debt to municipal equity. We canâ€™t wait to see where it goes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatrickWStanley/status/1400147259749068800))
