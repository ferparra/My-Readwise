	  First: even neurons seeing just part of an object are aware of the whole
	  
	  Why does it matter? Keep reading

	- More on distributed perception.
	  
	  For a person with a negative emotional association to examining his belief and / or who hasn’t been prompted to examine them, it is perfectly possible to hold incompatible beliefs.

	- The easiest way to understand the distributed brain is to think as the brain as a company, and brain regions as its employees: each with only a partial perspective of what's going on in the company

	- In the brain, there is no check on whether the information is correct; only on whether it is locally coherent
	  
	  Illusions and delusions occur when the output of multiple regions is coherent yet faulty.
