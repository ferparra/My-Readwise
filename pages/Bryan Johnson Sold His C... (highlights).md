		- **Note**: Thread
	- @bryan_johnson created "Project Blueprint".
	  
	  It aims to measure all 70+ organs of Bryans's body and then reverse the biological age of each as much as possible.
	  
	  Bryan reduced his epigenetic age by 5.1 years in 7 months by following it. 
	  
	  From age 47 to 42.5. 
	  
	  How did he do it?
