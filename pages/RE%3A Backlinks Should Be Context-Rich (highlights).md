document_note:: The author responds to a rebuttal by Jared Gorski to the author's article "Backlinks are bad links", by addressing two points raised. Firstly, while Gorski believes that backlinks have value in acknowledging links directed at a note, the author argues that there is an opportunity cost to this, as a list of too many backlinks can become overwhelming and add cognitive burden over time. Secondly, the author challenges Gorski's claim that backlinks can be intentional, arguing that the meaning of a link cannot truly be represented through a backlink context, but only through a consciously placed forward link. The author further adds that backlinks should be context-rich to be meaningful, but struggles to provide examples of such usage in the realm of note-taking and integrated thinking environments beyond publicly known presentations like manuals or notes.
