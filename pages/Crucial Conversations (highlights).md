	- “The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place”
	- The problem in hard conversations is not the content of the message but the condition of the conversation - people don’t feel safe. To create safety, address Mutual Respect - what you don’t mean and emphasize Mutual Purpose - that you are working toward the same goal that benefits everyone
	- When we’re at impasse, it’s often because we confuse what we’re asking for with what we actually want. Step out of the content of the conversation, explore the purposes behind them and new options will become possible
	- Just after we process information and take any action based on how we feel towards it, we tell ourselves a story. Since we are the only person in charge of how we add meaning to what we observe, we can take back control of our own emotions by telling a different story.
