	- Can I Just Interrupt?
	  
	  Summary:
	  Elon Musk: You would think that additional sensors are an asset to you. But if you fully consider the entire product in its entirety, these sensors are actually potentially liability. They don't just appear on your car; they need something you need to have an entire supply chain. And so it actually like bloats, you're going to be a lot of it.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  I would almost reframe the question in some way. So the thing is basically, you would think that additional sensors, by the way, can I just interrupt?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I wonder if a language model will ever do that if you prompt it. Let me reframe your question. That would be epic.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  This is the wrong problem. Sorry.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  It's like a little bit of a wrong question because basically you would think that these sensors are an asset to you. But if you fully consider the entire product in its entirety, these sensors are actually potentially liability, because these sensors aren't free. They don't just appear on your car. You need something you need to have an entire supply chain. You have people procuring it. There can be problems with them. They may need replacement. They are part of the manufacturing process. They can hold back the line in production. You need to source them, you need to maintain them, you have to have teams that ride the firmware, all of it, and then you also have to incorporate them, fuse them into the system in some way. And so it actually like bloats, you're going to be a lot of it. And I think Elon is really good at simplifying, simplified, best part is no part. And he always tries to throw away things that are not essential, because he understands the entropy in organizations and in an approach. And I think in this case, the cost is high, and you're not potentially seeing it if you're just a computer vision engineer. And I'm just trying to improve my network.

	- Elon Musk: Is It a Good Idea?
	  
	  Summary:
	  Tesla uses Google map like similar kind of resolution information in the system. But it will not pre map environments to send me a level accuracy. So it's very useful to have a low level map of the connectivity of your road. You know that there's a fork coming up. When you drive an environment, you have that high level understanding. It's like a small Google map. Elon is a very efficient warrior in the fight against entropy in organizations. He basically runs the world's biggest startups, I would say.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  I think I think too long. As you mentioned, like they pre map all the environments and they need to refresh the map. And they have a perfect centimeter level accuracy map of everywhere they're going to drive. It's crazy. How are you going to? We're talking about the autonomy actually changing the world. We're talking about the deployment on the global scale with autonomous systems for transportation. And if you need to maintain a centimeter accurate map for Earth, we're like for many cities and keep them updated. It's a huge dependency that you're taking on, huge dependency. It's a massive, massive dependency. And now you need to ask yourself, do you really need it? And humans don't need it. So it's very useful to have a low level map of the connectivity of your road. You know that there's a fork coming up. When you drive an environment, you have that high level understanding. It's like a small Google map. And Tesla uses Google map like similar kind of resolution information in the system. But it will not pre map environments to send me a level accuracy. It's a crutch. It's a distraction. It costs entropy. And it diffuses the team. It dilutes the team. And you're not focusing on what's actually necessary, which is a computer vision problem.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  What did you learn about machine learning, about engineering, about life, about yourself as one human being from working with Elon Musk?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I think the most I've learned is about how to sort of run organizations efficiently and how to create efficient organizations and how to fight entropy in an organization.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So human engineering in the fight against entropy?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah. There's a, there's a, I think, Elon is a very efficient warrior in the fight against entropy in organizations. What does entropy in an organization look like? Exactly. It's it's process. It's, it's process and in efficiencies in the form of meetings and that kind of stuff. Yeah, meetings, he hates meetings. He keeps telling people to skip meetings. If they're not useful. He basically runs the world's biggest startups, I would say. ([Time 1:38:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0e094a0b-cfea-4fd3-b2af-f8ed303ca8bb))
	- The AM Hours
	  
	  Summary:
	  During my PhD, it was even later, I used to go to sleep usually at three AM. The AM hours are precious and very interesting time to work because everyone is asleep. And so you're not going to be bothered and you have solid chunks of time to do work. So I like those periods night owl by default. "I'm not a morning person. I'm a night owl for sure"
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  I'm not a morning person. I'm a night owl for sure. Is it stable or not? It's semi stable like eight or nine or something like that. During my PhD, it was even later, I used to go to sleep usually at three AM. I think the AM hours are precious and very interesting time to work because everyone is asleep. At eight AM or seven AM, the east coast is awake. So there's already activity, there's already some text messages, whatever, there's stuff happening. You can go on like some news website and there's stuff happening and distracting. At three AM, everything is totally quiet. And so you're not going to be bothered and you have solid chunks of time to do work. So I like those periods night owl by default. And then I think like productive time, basically, what I like to do is you need to build some momentum on a problem without too much distraction. And you need to load your RAM, your working memory with that problem. And then you need to be obsessed with it when you're taking shower, when you're falling asleep. You need to be obsessed with the problem and it's fully in your memory. And you're ready to wake up and work on it right there.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So it is a scale of, is this in a scale, temporal scale of a single day or a couple of days a week a month. ([Time 2:16:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1ea1f1e2-34f4-4211-8e1a-24a9ca8c1051))
	- Is There a Difference Between Plant-Based and Plant-Forward?
	  
	  Summary:
	  I think to me also, big factor is, you know, our other humans are going to appreciate it. Are they going to like it? That's a big part of my motivation. If I'm helping humans and they seem happy, they say nice things,. They tweet about it or whatever, that gives me pleasure because I'm doing something useful. You enjoy the feeling of other people gaining value and happiness from the stuff you've created. Yeah. What about diet? Is there, I saw you play in a minute fast. Do you fast? I help with everything. With the things you play, what's been most beneficial to your ability to mentally focus on a thing and just mental
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, just like whenever I get obsessed about a problem, something just needs to work, something just needs to exist. It needs to exist.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  And so you're able to deal with bugs and programming issues and technical issues and design decisions that turn out to be the wrong ones. You're able to think through all of that given that you want to think to exist.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, it needs to exist. And then I think to me also, big factor is, you know, our other humans are going to appreciate it. Are they going to like it? That's a big part of my motivation. If I'm helping humans and they seem happy, they say nice things, they tweet about it or whatever, that gives me pleasure because I'm doing something useful. So like you do see yourself sharing it with the world. Like with some GitHub, with the blog post or to videos. Yeah, I was thinking about it. Like suppose I did all these things, but did not share them. I don't think I would have the same amount of motivation that I can build up.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  You enjoy the feeling of other people gaining value and happiness from the stuff you've created. Yeah. What about diet? Is there, I saw you play in a minute fast. Do you fast? I help with everything. With the things you play, what's been most beneficial to your ability to mentally focus on a thing and just mental mental productivity and happiness.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  You're still fast? Yeah, I still fast, but I do intermittent fasting. But really what it means at the end of the day is I skip breakfast. So I do 18, six roughly by default when I'm in my steady state. If I'm traveling or doing something else, I will break the rules. ([Time 2:21:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5bdded7d-72c6-4ef6-841a-da8658ef22e8))
	- Is There Imposter Syndrome?
	  
	  Summary:
	  DeepMind specifically has been working in the regime of having slightly higher quality basically process and latency. But I don't know to what extent that's part of their objective function also. So it's not just the prestige, a little bit of the delay is part of it. Yeah, let's speed up the rest of the community.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, let's speed up the rest of the community. But I don't know to what extent that's part of their objective function also.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  That's true. So it's not just the prestige, a little bit of the delay is part of it.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, they certainly DeepMind specifically has been working in the regime of having slightly higher quality basically process and latency and publishing those papers that way.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Another question from Reddit. Do you or have you suffered from imposter syndrome? Being the director of AI Tesla, being this person when you're at Stanford, where like the world looks at you as the expert in AI to teach the world about machine learning.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  When I was leaving Tesla after five years, I spent a ton of time in meeting rooms. And I would read papers in the beginning when I joined Tesla, I was writing code and then I was writing less and less code and I was reading code and then I was reading less and less code. And so this is just a natural progression that happens, I think. And definitely, I would say near the tail end, that's when it sort of like starts to hit you a bit more that you're supposed to be an expert. But actually, the source of truth is the code that people are writing the GitHub and the actual code itself. And you're not as familiar with that as you used to be. And so I would say maybe there's some like insecurity there. ([Time 2:39:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4ce13c2d-04eb-4021-a702-376df9bb16e1))
	- Are You Spending 10,000 Hours?
	  
	  Summary:
	  You have to read code. Code is the source of truth. It's impossible to translate all that code into actual, you know, paper form. So when things come out, especially when they have a source code available, that's my favorite place to go. I don't know if there's a better way. You need to put in 10,000 hours. That's what I focus on.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Code is the source of truth. The papers and everything else. It's a high level summary. I don't, yeah, just a high level summary. But at the end of the day, you have to read code. It's impossible to translate all that code into actual, you know, paper form. So when things come out, especially when they have a source code available, that's my favorite place to go.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So like I said, you're one of the greatest teachers of machine learning, AI ever, from CS 231N to today, what advice would you give to beginners interested in getting into machine learning?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Beginners are often focused on like what to do. And I think the focus should be more like how much you do. So I am kind of like believer on a high level and this 10,000 hours kind of concept where you just kind of have to just pick the things where you can spend time and you care about and you're interested in, you literally have to put in 10,000 hours of work. It doesn't even like matter as much like where you put it and you'll iterate and you'll improve and you'll waste some time. I don't know if there's a better way. You need to put in 10,000 hours. But I think it's actually really nice because I feel like there's some sense of determinism about being an expert at a thing if you spend 10,000 hours, you can literally pick an arbitrary thing. And I think if you spend 10,000 hours of deliberate effort and work, you actually will become an expert at it. And so I think it's kind of like a nice thought. And so basically, I would focus more on like, are you spending 10,000 hours? That's what I focus on. ([Time 2:40:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/107f1895-2c00-47f0-9be3-39b1e91ba3f7))
	- Is There a Moonshot in AGI?
	  
	  Summary:
	  I'm suspicious that text realm is not enough to build full understanding of the world. Do you think you need to touch the world to understand it also? Well, that's the big open question I would say in my mind. If you also require the embodiment and the ability to interact with the world, run experiments and have data of that form, then you need to go to optimus or something like that.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  I think, as I mentioned, I'm suspicious that text realm is not enough to actually build full understanding of the world. I do actually think you need to go into pixels and understand the physical world and how it works. So I do think that we need to extend these models to consume images and videos and train on a lot more data that is multimodal in that way. Do you think you need to touch the world to understand it also? Well, that's the big open question I would say in my mind. If you also require the embodiment and the ability to interact with the world, run experiments and have data of that form, then you need to go to optimus or something like that. I would say optimus in some way is like a hedge in AGI because it seems to me that it's possible that just having data from the internet is not enough. If that is the case, then optimus may lead to AGI because optimus, to me, there's nothing beyond optimus. You have this humanoid form factor that can actually do stuff in the world. You can have millions of them interacting with humans and so on. If that doesn't give rise to AGI at some point, I'm not sure what will. From a completeness perspective, I think that's a really good platform, but it's a much harder platform because you are dealing with atoms and you need to actually build these things and integrate them into society. I think that path takes longer, but it's much more certain. Then there's a path of the internet and just like training these compression models effectively on trying to compress all the internet. That might also give these agents as well. ([Time 2:50:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a0bc260b-0230-4bd4-abd2-3d7be4ccb1b3))
	- I Love the Backup on Mars
	  
	  Summary:
	  Do you think we'll become a multi-paintary species? Probably yes, but I don't know if it's dominant feature of future humanity. We still have to solve the drivers of self-destruction here on earth. So just having a backup on Mars is not gonna solve the problem. Would you go to Mars? Personally, no, I do like earth quite a lot. But maybe eventually I would once it's safe enough.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  Yes, that explosion could be destructive and constructive and the probabilities are non-zero in both lenses.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I'm gonna have to, I do feel like I have to try to be optimistic and so on. And I think even in this case I still am predominantly optimistic but there's definitely me too.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Do you think we'll become a multi-paintary species?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Probably yes, but I don't know if it's dominant feature of future humanity. There might be some people on some planets and so on but I'm not sure if it's like, yeah, if it's like a major player in our culture and so on.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  We still have to solve the drivers of self-destruction here on earth. So just having a backup on Mars is not gonna solve the problem.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So by the way, I love the backup on Mars. I think that's amazing. You should absolutely do that. Yes. And I'm so thankful.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Would you go to Mars?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Personally, no, I do like earth quite a lot.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I'll go to Mars. I'll go feed. I'll tweet at you from there.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Maybe eventually I would once it's safe enough but I don't actually know if it's on my lifetime scale unless I can extend it by a lot. I do think that for example a lot of people might disappear into virtual realities and stuff like that. I think that could be the major thrust of sort of the cultural development of humanity if it survives. So it might not be, it's just really hard to work in physical realm and go out there. And I think ultimately all your experiences are in your brain. ([Time 3:09:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/caee789e-a5d4-44d7-bf10-0b6e0a085194))
	- Are You Using Technology to Empower Humanity?
	  
	  Summary:
	  I like just people being humans in the way we sort of like slightly evolved and prefer I think just by default. My happy place is like people I love thinking about cool problems around by a lush beautiful dynamic nature. And secretly high tech in places that count places that go. So you use technology to empower that love for other humans and nature. Yeah. You mentioned the vital question. Many of course. Anything by Nikhilane really life-affirming would be good, because he's been talking about so many different things. He was very impacted by this office gene. It made me want to do my job more effectively.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah. I think currently the virtual reality is not that compelling. I do think it can improve a lot, but I don't really know to what extent maybe you know there's actually like even more exotic things you can think about with like neural links or stuff like that. So currently I kind of see myself as mostly a team human person. I love nature. I love harmony. I love people. I love humanity. I love emotions of humanity. And I just want to be like in this like solar punk little utopia that's my happy place. Yes. My happy place is like people I love thinking about cool problems around by a lush beautiful dynamic nature.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Yeah. And secretly high tech in places that count places that go. So you use technology to empower that love for other humans and nature. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I think technology used like very sparingly. I don't love when it sort of gets in the way of humanity in many ways. I like just people being humans in the way we sort of like slightly evolved and prefer I think just by default.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  People kept asking me because they know you love reading. Are there particular books that you enjoyed that had an impact on you for silly or for profound reasons that you recommend? You mentioned the vital question.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Many of course. I think in biology as an example, the vital question is a good one. Anything by Nikhilane really life ascending I would say is like a bit more potentially representative is like a summary of a lot of the things he's been talking about. I was very impacted by this office gene. ([Time 3:12:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/15fc2695-eda0-4f39-a569-e145c83d2533))
	- What Makes You Special?
	  
	  Summary:
	  "What makes me special is more like the gang of genes that are writing in my chromosomes," he says. "It's a new second layer that hasn't been there before the brain." Jean and Niklane both coexist, but they're willing to step one level down for each others' sake.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, from the oceanfront view, what makes me special is more like the gang of genes that are writing in my chromosomes, I suppose, they're the replicating unit, I suppose.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  No, but that's just for a few. The thing that makes you special, sure. Well, the reality is what makes you special is your ability to survive based on the software that runs on the hardware that was built by the genes. So the software is the thing that makes you survive not the hardware.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  It's a little over both. It's just like a second layer. It's a new second layer that hasn't been there before the brain. They both coexist. But there's also layers of the software.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I mean, it's not it's a abstraction at the top of abstractions. But okay, so so soft is Jean and Niklane.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I would say sometimes books are like not sufficient. I like to reach for textbooks sometimes. I kind of feel like books are for too much of a general consumption of some time. And they just kind of like they're too high up in the level of abstraction, and it's not good enough. So I like textbooks. I like the cell. I think the cell is pretty cool. That's why also I like writing of Niklane is because he's pretty willing to step one level down. And he doesn't. Yeah, he sort of he's willing to go there. But he's also willing to sort of be throughout the stack. ([Time 3:15:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/960bf643-e03b-4107-82a0-ebb4af9530e3))
	- Are You Interested in AI?
	  
	  Summary:
	  I don't want to work on any one specific problem. There's too many problems. So how can you work on all problems simultaneously? You solve the meta problem, which to me is just intelligence and how do you automate it? Is there cool small projects like archive sanity and so on that you're thinking about the world that ML world can anticipate? I was surprised that transcription with opening as Whisperer was working so well compared to what I'm familiar with from Siri or a few other systems.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  So when you think about AI, are you interested in all kinds of applications, all kinds of domains, and any domain you focus on will allow you to get insights of the big problem of a GI? Yeah, for me, it's the ultimate mental problem.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I don't want to work on any one specific problem. There's too many problems. So how can you work on all problems simultaneously? You solve the meta problem, which to me is just intelligence and how do you automate it?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Is there cool small projects like archive sanity and so on that you're thinking about the world that ML world can anticipate?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  There's some always like some fun side projects. Archive sanity is one. Basically, there's way too many archive papers. How can I organize it and recommend papers and so on? I transcribed all of your podcasts.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  What did you learn from that experience from transcribing the process of like you like consuming audiobooks and podcasts and so on? Here's the process that achieves closer to human level performance and annotation.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, well, I definitely was surprised that transcription with opening as Whisperer was working so well compared to what I'm familiar with from Siri and like a few other systems, I guess. ([Time 3:23:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dc3be4ac-c37f-48cb-ae2b-3ea3fff7d1fe))
	- What Is the Meaning of Life?
	  
	  Summary:
	  We talked about sort of the universe having a conversation with us humans or with the systems we create to try to answer. The first level answer I would say is anyone can choose their own meaning of life because we are conscious entity and it's beautiful. But I do think that like a deeper meaning of life, if someone is interested is a long lines of like, what the hell is all this? And like, why?
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  Well, the sad thing is your brain and mind developed in a time where before Twitter, before the internet, so I wonder people that are born inside of it might have a different experience. Like I, maybe you can, will still resist it. And the people born now will not.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, I do feel like humans are extremely malleable. Yeah. And you're probably right.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  What is the meaning of life, Andre? We talked about sort of the universe having a conversation with us humans or with the systems we create to try to answer. For the universe, for the creator of the universe to notice us, we're trying to create systems that are loud enough to answer back.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I don't know. That's the meaning of life. That's like meaning of life for some people. The first level answer I would say is anyone can choose their own meaning of life because we are conscious entity and it's beautiful. Number one. But I do think that like a deeper meaning of life, if someone is interested is a long lines of like, what the hell is all this? And like, why? And if you look at the into fundamental physics and the quantum field theory and the standard model, they're like, way, very complicated. And there's this like, you know, 19 free parameter parameters of our universe. ([Time 3:28:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e0bff9fb-96b2-4969-a66e-54d54e33e2b2))
	- The World Without Death
	  
	  Summary:
	  I don't know that people fully realize this. I kind of feel like people think of death as an inevitability. It makes sense why things like this happen, evolutionarily speaking. That would be interesting if death is eventually looked at as a fascinating thing that used to happen to humans. Of whoever wants to, not many people might not want that.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Of whoever wants to, not many people might not want that. But I think people who do want that, I think it's probably possible. And I don't know that people fully realize this. I kind of feel like people think of death as an inevitability. But at the end of the day, this is a physical system. Something's go wrong. It makes sense why things like this happen, evolutionarily speaking. And there's most certainly interventions that are that medigate it.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  That would be interesting if death is eventually looked at as a fascinating thing that used to happen to humans.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I don't think it's unlikely. I think it's, I think it's likely.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  And it's up to our imagination to try to predict what the world without death looks like. Yeah, it's hard to, I think the values will completely change.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Could be. I don't, I don't really buy all these ideas that, oh, without death, there's no meaning, there's nothing else. I don't intuitively buy all those arguments. I think there's plenty of meaning, plenty of things to learn. They're interesting, exciting. I want to know, I want to calculate, I want to improve the condition of all the humans and organisms that are alive.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Yeah, the way we find meaning might change. There is a lot of humans, probably including myself, that finds meaning in the finiteness of things. But that doesn't mean that's the only source meaning. ([Time 3:30:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/93611fb2-11a9-4864-ab96-6142e5858a22))
