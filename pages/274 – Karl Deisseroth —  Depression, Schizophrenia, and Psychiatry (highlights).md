	  Is it fair to assume that basically every member of the human species suffers from a large number of disorders? Then, well, we just have to pick which one s are debilitating for each person. And in some ways, that's the essence of what i was hoping to approach with the book, is to reflect on this spectrum that exists for all the disorders. There is taking nothing away from the severity and the suffering that comes at the extreme end of these illnesses.

	  So is it fair to assume that basically, every member of the human species suffers from a large number of disorders then?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, we just have to pick which ones are debilitating for each person. You know, if you look at the numbers, there are, you know, if you look at how our mental health disorders are currently defined, you can look at population prevalence values for all these disorders, and you can come up with estimates that somebody will have a lifetime prevalence of having a psychiatric disorder that approaches 25% or so. And so that's, and in some studies, it could be more, some studies, it could be less. Now, what do we do with that number? What does that mean? And in some ways, that's the essence of what I was hoping to approach with the book, is to reflect on this spectrum that exists for all the disorders. There is, and taking nothing away from the severity and the suffering that comes at the extreme end of these illnesses, but nearly every one of them exists on a spectrum of severity, from nearly functional to completely dysfunctional, life-threatening, and even fatal. And so that number, 25%, more or less, it doesn't capture that spectrum of severity.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  To look at that number, what do those numbers come from? Is it self-report? Is it people who show up and say, I need help? ([Time 0:12:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/90357a67-1d66-4ccf-b5a5-ca7732ed847c))
