	- WAVES is the biggest ponzi in crypto
	  
	  It has recklessly engineered price spikes by borrowing USDC at 35% to buy its own token
	  
	  Continuous WAVES market cap growth is needed to keep the system stable
	  
	  WAVES will eventually crash and USDN will break with it
	  
	  You're on noticeðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1509581295621451779))

	- $WAVES is a layer 1 blockchain
	  
	  It's principal use case is minting of USDN --- its native stablecoin
	  
	  You can compare WAVE to LUNA/MKR while USDN is UST/DAI
	  
	  For more background read below

	- The WAVES market cap has 6xâ€™d in 2 months
	  
	  The initial catalyst was narratives around WAVES being the â€˜Russian Ethereumâ€™
	  
	  Despite 0 KPI traction ---- it has massively outperformed ETH

	- WAVES needs to grow market cap so it can issue more USDN
	  
	  The health of the ecosystem is defined as WAVES Mkt Cap / USDN
	  
	  This ratio shows us how much more USDN can be issued
	  
	  We have seen USDN supply shrink once backing hits 2.5x --- this is the minimum target

	- Because of the price pump WAVES has created USDN issuance capacity
	  
	  Assuming a 2.5x target --- WAVES can issue $1,380mm more USDN
	  
	  USDN yields at this target will be 5.4% vs USDC/T supply rates on AAVE at 3.5%

	- We have recently see USDN minted at the fastest rate in history
	  
	  Over the last 4 weeks --- USDN has gone from $475mm to $875mm --- 85% increase while DAI has gone down
	  
	  Why would anyone want to hold USDN?

	- USDN is backed by WAVES
	  
	  WAVES has a native staking rate of 3.13%
	  
	  USDN yields = WAVES native staking rate (x) backing ratio
	  
	  Right now USDN yields are 3.31% * 6.60x = 21.8%
	  
	  But as more USDN is issued --- yields will drop ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1509581312390275089))
	- To keep the train on tracks there needs to be continuous growth in WAVES market cap
	  
	  Once backing starts to drop --- USDN yields will drop
	  
	  At 6.60x backing yields are 21.8%
	  
	  At 2.5x --- yields are 5.4%
	  
	  Capital flight is a risk at lower yields ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1509581314655195139))
	- I will walk you through how the WAVES team is folding leverage to engineering a massive supply squeeze
	  
	  Here is the flow
	  -Deposit USDN on Vires
	  -Borrow USDC on Vires
	  -Transfer USDC to Binance
	  -Buy WAVES with USDC
	  -Convert WAVES to USDN
	  -Start over
	  
	  This is trackable onchain ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1509581316689383425))
	- Vires is the AAVE equivalent on the WAVES protocol
	  
	  It holds $607mm / $875mm = 70% of all USDN on its platform
	  
	  It also allows for USDC / USDT borrow and lending
	  
	  Current USDC supply rates are 30% 
	  
	  This is the largest yield vs any other money market protocol

	- USDC/USDT borrowing has gone bonkers over the last 2 months
	  
	  Borrowing rates exceed anything anyone else is paying on any other chain
	  
	  Who is borrowing and why?

	- WAVES has been borrowing USDC/T against USDN
	  
	  WAVES send USDC/T to Binance and buy WAVES
	  
	  Then transfer WAVES to their wallet and mint more USDN
	  
	  Supply USDN on https://t.co/yyoiIOI84w to be able to borrow more USDC/T
	  
	  Cycle repeats ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1509581325916909572))
	- WAVES must attract USDC/T to VIRES to borrow agianst newly minted USDN
	  
	  Nobody else will lend against USDN
	  
	  Therefore WAVES must offer above market prices to incentivize USDC/T into the platform
	  
	  No hard currency access = no leveraging ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1509581327942754314))
	- WAVES has 100mm of supply
	  
	  85% of it is staked
	  
	  That leaves us with 16mm of â€˜tradeableâ€™ WAVES
	  
	  Exchanges need working capital & some holders won't sell
	  
	  Letâ€™s assume thatâ€™s 30% which = 10.5mm
	  
	  Itâ€™s easy to manipulate your mkt cap when theres 10.5% of tradeable supply ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1509581331440844807))
	- WAVES can issue $1,380mm more USDN before it breaches target backing
	  
	  $1,380mm is chasing 10.5mm of non-staked supply
	  
	  That means WAVES can pay $131.43/token
	  
	  The WAVES ponzi will grow before it shrinks

	- But for this to work you need muppets to deposit USDC into Vires
	  
	  Nobody will USDN --- thatâ€™s why WAVES deposits USDN to borrow USDC
	  
	  Therefore WAVES is capped by the USDC supply pool
	  I think its reasonable that this wont be that much of an issue

	- USDN issuance will eventually taper out once USDN reaches its target backing
	  
	  Once its reached --- there is no more programmatic WAVES buying
	  
	  Velocity dies ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1509581339263213572))
	- If WAVES prices drop enough ---- WAVES mkt cap could be less than USDN outstanding
	  
	  This would mean USDN is insolvent and would depeg
	  
	  If USDN depegs is material --- the USDC short on Vires could liquidate $607mm of the $875mm outstanding USDN
	  
	  This would be Armageddon ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1509581342660513801))
	- I call the platform ponzi because it is being propped up by borrowed money
	  
	  There is no organic activity
	  
	  Just look at the transaction count over time

	- Every 2 days at 10-12pm est
	  
	  WAVES
	- This high volume / price action is baiting day traders into momentum longs w/ tight stops
	  
	  Korean exchangs are consistently the highest traded place for WAVES
	  
	  The ponzi keeps going
