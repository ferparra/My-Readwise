	- 1/6) Solana was DDoS attacked again yesterday
	  
	  This attack exploited fundamental design flaws which are considered features by SOL
	  
	  As it sacrifices decentralization & security for speed
	  
	  While ignoring the consequences of that trade off
	  
	  Specifically Proof of History & Turbine: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Justin_Bons/status/1469375118036160529))

	- 2/6) A consequence of PoH is deterministic block creation:
	  
	  There is a good reason why public blockchains before SoL did not take this route
	  
	  Non-deterministic block creation adds to security & censorship resistance as you cannot predict who will create the next block ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Justin_Bons/status/1469375120124882951))
	- 3/6) Instead in SoL it is possible to predict & therefore attack the next block producers inline
	  
	  For instance attacking the next 100 validators inline instead of attacking the entire network
	  
	  This attack also works regardless of scale, thereby severely reducing SOL security ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Justin_Bons/status/1469375121865461773))
	- 4/6) SOL security is not just reduced against DDoS attacks since this attack can also be combined with a 51% attack
	  
	  Allowing an attacker to temporarily gain proportional staked control over the network by attacking other large stake holders
	  
	  These are all consequences of PoH! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Justin_Bons/status/1469375123694235656))
	- 5/6) Combining Turbine with PoH leads to even more dire consequences:
	  
	  Turbine divides the transaction memory pool into small groupings of validators
	  
	  This means that with PoH you can censor transactions by just attacking the specific validators in that grouping next inline! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Justin_Bons/status/1469375125317427212))
	- 6/6) This is just one aspect of SOL's design that exposes the bad faith of its creation
	  
	  Prioritizing attracting ignorant cryptocurrency investors over good sustainable blockchain design
	  
	  There are many examples like this in terms of design as well as lies & fraud, buyer beware ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Justin_Bons/status/1469375127020310533))
