	- 1. It's not enough to be big, you typically have to be bigger than competition to generate value.
	  
	  The overall concentration of an industry does not predict profitability of that industry. But market share of a firm relative to its competition does. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danhockenmaier/status/1614312177430835200))
