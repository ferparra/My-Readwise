document_note:: The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker argues that human civilization is an elaborate defense mechanism against mortality, and that traditional "hero systems" such as religion are no longer convincing in today's age of reason. He believes that mental illness is caused by an inability to create a strong enough "hero project" and proposes that the gradual realization of humanity's innate motivations (death) can help bring about a better world. Becker encourages readers to be mindful of their desire to make their mark and leave a legacy, and suggests that facing the terror of death can help one live life to the fullest. He ultimately argues that understanding our motivation to cheat death is key to understanding ourselves and others.
