	- Took a deep dive into @LangChainAI this weekend.
	  
	  LangChain is a simple way for tools like ChatGPT to connect with the world.
	  
	  What are the biggest issues with Open AI's ChatGPT?
	  1. Outdated training data.
	  2. Token limits.
	  3. Limited ability to talk with other apps. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EdringtonSean/status/1642718826201591808))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- LangChain fixes all that, and way more.
	  
	  It's fascinating to see how quickly @hwchase17 and his team are pushing releases.
	  
	  This space is moving so fast and, hopefully, this isn't too outdated before next weekend.
	  
	  Here are some items I learned about LangChain this weekend. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EdringtonSean/status/1642718827526909952))
	- 1. LangChain is able to connect directly to the internet. 
	  
	  Meaning you could prompt the model with, "Who will be in the Men's Basketball Championship tomorrow?" and it will give you the correct response.
	  
	  This only takes a few lines of code.

	- 2. LangChain can load massive PDF documents, transcripts, and bills from congress. 
	  
	  After loading, LangChain is able to get past the 'max token issue' by splitting the text and chunking the data.
	  
	  This makes it easy to interact with, talk with, and build models around any doc.

	- 3. LangChain makes it easy to connect with tools like Zapier to do, well, pretty much anything you want.
	  
	  With just a few lines of code, you can connect to Zapier's new NLA API.

	- How is Langchain able to do all this?
	  Vectors!
	  
	  Langchain, with the help of tools like @pinecone , can build a vector database that makes it easy to build massive models.
	  
	  Think of Vectors as the 'datatization' of text.

	- So where are we now? Well, who knows?
	  
	  What I do know is that this space is moving at lightspeed and every week brings about new changes.
	  
	  I'm going to continue learning from people like @GregKamradt and @mayowaoshin ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EdringtonSean/status/1642718834380472321))
