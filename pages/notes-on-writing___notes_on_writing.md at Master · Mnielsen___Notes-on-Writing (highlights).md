	- This observation matters because it's often tempting to let your purpose expand and become vague. Writing a piece about gardens? Hey, why not include that important related thought you had about rainforests? Now you have a piece that's sort of about gardens and sort of about rainforests, and not really about anything. The reader can no longer bond to it. This expansion in purpose is done with the best of intentions --- you want to tell the reader all your good ideas. But it breaks the clarity of your communication with the reader. It's a type of discursive disease.

	- A complicating factor is that sometimes you need to explore beyond the boundaries of your current purpose. You're writing for purpose A, but your instinct says that you need to explore subject B. Unfortunately, you're not yet sure how subject B fits in. If that's the case then you must take time to explore, and to understand how, if at all, subject B fits in, and whether you need to revise your purpose. This is emotionally difficult. It creates uncertainty, and you may feel as though your work on subject B is wasted effort.

	- When in trouble, quickly brainstorm ten or more opening sentences: On occasion, one comes to a piece of writing with the perfect opening sentence. Take the good fortune and run!
