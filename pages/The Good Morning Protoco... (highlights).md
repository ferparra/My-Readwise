	- The Good Morning Protocol
	  
	  Yesterday I wrote about the "Why" of using protocols.
	  
	  Today I want to share a protocol I regularly return to for a great start into my day:
	  
	  The Good Morning Protocol â€“ with a visual checklist at the endðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1544680083264258048))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Quick background before we get started: this protocol is entirely based on the science shared by @hubermanlab on his incredible podcast.
	  
	  To say that his podcast changed my life would be a tremendous understatement.
	  
	  Any errors or adaptations that don't work are mine alone. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1544680088511414273))
	- @hubermanlab Step 1: Drink Water
	  
	  Drink 500ml of plain water.
	  Also take some salt and magnesium to help your brain.

	- @hubermanlab Step 2: Get Some Sun
	  
	  Aim for 10 â€“ 30 minutes of direct sunlight within 20 minutes of waking up.
	  No sunglasses.

	- @hubermanlab Step 3: Move Forward

	- @hubermanlab Step 4: Take A Cold Shower
	  
	  Take 2 â€“ 5 minutes. Make it uncomfortable but not painful.
	  No music to distract you.

	- @hubermanlab Step 5: Get Some Protein
	  
	  Break your fast with some protein. 
	  Eat around one hour after waking up (later is fine).

	- @hubermanlab Step 6: Delay Caffeine
	  
	  Give yourself at least 90 minutes after waking up before consuming caffeine.
	  This avoids the afternoon crash.
