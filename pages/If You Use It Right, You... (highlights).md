	- If you use it right, your Twitter account is worth more than your degree.
	  
	  But 98.8% suck at it.
	  
	  Here are 9 unique ways to turn Twitter into a crazy valuable asset: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/aaditsh/status/1432369566764634112))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Highly Curate Your Following
	  
	  99% of users follow real-time news on Twitter.
	  
	  That's okay. But you won't make Twitter an asset then.
	  
	  To make it an asset, build a high-signal information diet.
	  
	  You'll see it as a whole new opportunity.
	  
	  Let me show you... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/aaditsh/status/1432369574129934339))
	- Use Twitter Lists
	  
	  I find way too much news, drama and irrelevant ideas on the Twitter timeline.
	  
	  I use Twitter lists to cut the noise and amplify the signal.
	  
	  Bonus: Lists aren't affected by the algorithm.
	  
	  Here's a video to get started on Lists: https://t.co/8WJ7R53snA ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/aaditsh/status/1432369606098890752))
	- Use Advanced Search
	  
	  Scrape the internet to find what you want:
	  
	  "(from:aaditsh) min_faves:1000 marketing"
	  
	  Tweets with "marketing" from @aaditsh with more than 1000 likes.
	  
	  Another favorite:
	  
	  "(from:aaditsh) until:2021-09-01 since:2021-05-01"
	  
	  Between May and September. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/aaditsh/status/1432369610834202630))
	- Mute Trolls
	  
	  Trust me. They're not worth your time.
	  
	  Click on a profile that annoys you.
	  
	  Click "more" → "mute profile".
	  
	  You won't "block" them but their content will become hidden on your timeline.
	  
	  It's so peaceful. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/aaditsh/status/1432369614659506180))
	- Polish Your Bio
	  
	  It's a 1 line identity on the internet.
	  
	  Make it crisp.
	  
	  Mine: "I deconstruct world-class growth philosophies & mental models"
	  
	  People now expect related content.
	  
	  They like to see when you meet expectations (and go beyond). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/aaditsh/status/1432369616995721226))
	- Integrate Your Revue Newsletter
	  
	  Use your newsletter to write more in-depth content.
	  
	  That's what I do at mine.
	  
	  I have seen 2x subscribers arriving at my newsletter.
	  
	  Seriously - this is a game-changer.

	- Write Twitter Threads
	  
	  Deconstruct complex topics into simple actionable tips for others.
	  
	  This act (itself) will turn your followers into "superfans".
	  
	  High-affinity audience = Valuable asset. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/aaditsh/status/1432369626810290176))
	- Network like you were born to.
	  
	  You've heard this a million times.
	  
	  If not, I'll say it again: You can literally reach anyone via Twitter DMs.
	  
	  Think Gary Vee, Tony Robbins, Tim Ferriss (omg, this is crazy).
	  
	  Don't shy away. Grow your network:

	- Install Minimal Twitter:
	  
	  I hate the "explore" section on Twitter. It's usually filled with news and garbage found in my location.
	  
	  I use the "Minimal Twitter" chrome extension to remove Explore.
	  
	  My entire Twitter experience has become 10x better.
