	- Is this life-altering?
	  
	  Our perception of the importance of any choice is often skewed by time.
	  
	  In the moment, even the smallest decisions can seem like they are "mission critical" in our minds.
	  
	  Pause.
	  
	  Don't sweat the small stuff.
	  
	  Give each decision the attention it deserves. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/blakeaburge/status/1451156361270550528))
	- Analyze possible outcomes.
	  
	  â€¢What happens if you make this choice?
	  
	  â€¢What definitely won't happen?
	  
	  â€¢What if you do the exact opposite?
	  
	  Understanding the most likely outcome of making (or not making) a decision allows the decision itself to become easier to grapple with. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/blakeaburge/status/1451156362570780673))
	- Be wary of biases.
	  
	  Whether we want to admit it or not, we all have them...
	  
	  Unconscious errors in thinking, caused by our brain's efforts to simplify the complex world around us.
	  
	  Learning to recognize bias is critical for effective decision-making.

	- Tap into your network.
	  
	  None of us are infallible.
	  
	  When struggling to make a move, reach out to trusted advisors within your circle.
	  
	  2 things are certain:
	  
	  â€¢People always have an opinion.
	  â€¢Hearing alternate viewpoints can open your mind to options you hadn't considered. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/blakeaburge/status/1451156365120991235))
	- Give it a minute.
	  
	  For most of us, thinking clearly & making the best possible choices under pressure is a tough ask.
	  
	  Many times, the first decision we make isn't the best.
	  
	  Take care to ensure you're assigning an appropriate level of urgency.
	  
	  Can it wait?  If yes, sleep on it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/blakeaburge/status/1451156366219829251))
	- Values matter.
	  
	  More often than not, you need only look inward to find the answer to what choices you should make.
	  
	  Align with your core values.
	  
	  When you make decisions that stay true to your ideals, the possibility of regret is immediately minimized. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/blakeaburge/status/1451156367322988557))
	- Know what you don't know.
	  
	  You can't be an expert in everything.
	  
	  Understanding, and perhaps more importantly, accepting your limitations is a game-changer.
	  
	  Don't be afraid to ask for help.
	  
	  It doesn't make you look weak or less intelligent, in fact, quite the opposite. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/blakeaburge/status/1451156368388341762))
	- Embrace uncertainty.
	  
	  Assuming you've worked through the steps above, sometimes the only thing left to do is act.
	  
	  Don't get so caught up in trying to ensure you make the "right" decision, that you end up doing the worst thing possible.
	  
	  Nothing.
	  
	  Remember, you can always pivot. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/blakeaburge/status/1451156369495642114))
