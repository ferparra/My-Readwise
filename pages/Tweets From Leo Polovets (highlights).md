	- A good recipe for startup ideas: take an internal tool from BigCo that you miss & build a better version of it for everyone else.
	  
	  There's a go-to-market corollary to this recipe: when you've built your version, sell it to fellow BigCo alumni. They miss their former tool, too. ðŸ™‚ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/search?q=A%20good%20recipe%20for%20startup%20ideas%3A%20take%20an%20internal%20tool%20from%20BigCo%20that%20you%20miss%20%26%20build%20a%20better%20version%20of%20it%20for%20everyone%20else.%20%20There%27s%20a%20go-to-market%20corollary%20to%20this%20recipe%3A%20when%20you%27ve%20built%20your%20version%2C%20sell%20it%20to%20fellow%20BigCo%20alum%20%28from%3A%40lpolovets%29))

	- @buggeroaf @runvc It's that, but also focusing on growth before you have product/market fit is like optimizing how quickly you can fill a leaky bucket with water instead of figuring out how to fix the bucket, or understanding if water is something you even want in the first place.

	- The more I work w/startups, the more I believe they should ignore traction metrics (ARR, growth rate, etc) until they're close to product/market fit.
	  
	  Once you report that you grew 50%/mo & hit $3k MRR, your team & investors will focus on optimizing traction instead of learning. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lpolovets/status/1221978669389770752))
