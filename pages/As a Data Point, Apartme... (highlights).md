	- As a data point, apartment rents in my area are up over 25% during the past 2.5 years.
	  
	  This is not primarily from supply chains, war, etc. It's from a 40% increase in the amount of broad money during that period (including the biggest year-over-year % increase since WWII).

	- These are mostly permanent increases, passed onto consumers.
	  
	  I spoke with the leading apartment manager in my area. Existing tenants are getting smaller increases; people who move in are the ones getting the full brunt of it.
	  
	  So, this will take time to affect more people. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1534619388086722563))
	- Republicans blame the Biden administration. The Biden administration blames Putin.
	  
	  Truth is, the sharp money supply increase began under Trump, continued under Biden, and was baked into the system due to how much debt has accumulated for decades.

	- Commodity capex cycles and war *contribute* to that as well.
	  
	  As for supply chains, the shocking thing is not how inflationary they are now. Instead, it's shocking how disinflationary they were for the past 25 years as we shipped manufacturing overseas. That part was the anomaly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1534619392000020484))
	- Whenever debt/GDP historically gets this high, it gets partially inflated away.
	  
	  Rather than defaulting on the debt, they increase the money supply and nominal GDP while holding interest rates below inflation levels.
