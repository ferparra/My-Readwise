	- Functional analysis helps us study and solve both linear and nonlinear problems posed on a normed space that is no longer finite-dimensional, a situation that arises very naturally in many concrete problems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn3ptx24j8t1eky827mw9y4z))
	- The fundamental topics from functional analysis covered in this course include normed spaces, completeness, functionals, the Hahn-Banach Theorem, duality, operators; Lebesgue measure, measurable functions, integrability, completeness of Láµ– spaces; Hilbert spaces; compact and self-adjoint operators; and the Spectral Theorem.
