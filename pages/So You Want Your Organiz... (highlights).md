	- So you want your organization to up its product game?
	  
	  12 Tips ðŸ§µ
	  
	  1/12- "They" aren't stupid. You don't know it all
	  
	  At lot of this stuff needs to be seen to be understood. And there's always something to learn (even from this people who seem to discount your work).

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 2/12- Lead with the Why not the Way (on repeat)
	  
	  Customers don't buy OKRs, Agile, Design Thinking, etc.
	  
	  Why are you advocating for better ways of working? Be a broken record about the Why. Don't become the Way Person. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1408959232364335108))
	- 3/12- Follow the $. Or work on the outskirts where no one is paying attention.
	  
	  If you're going to be overt, go where there's a burning platform. If you're going to be covert, work where people aren't really paying attention. Where progress was written off. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1408959233723297800))
	- 4/12-Prioritize situational awareness and observability.
	  
	  You'll need these things *always*. Don't wait to get basic measurement in place. Visualize work, etc. This works because it is valuable both when things "work" and when they don't. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1408959235010883595))
	- 5/12- Stories stick, theory doesn't. Show don't tell.
	  
	  People remember the stories. The effort that went well, that set a new example.  The ones that fell flat. The impact. They don't remember your lecture about product strategy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1408959236181139466))
	- 6/12- Focus on habits, routine, and practice. Results will follow.
	  
	  In a sense, figure out how to go through the motions. Get your rituals -- even minimal versions -- going. Do learning reviews. Present your roadmap. Do kickoffs. One-pager writing sessions. Walk the walk. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1408959237603004416))
	- 7/12-Increase flow around the learn, build, measure loop. Reduce WIP (work in progress) and PIP (promises in progress).
	  
	  You need breathing room. High WIP makes things SO much harder. Don't stop at shipping stuff. Expand the loop to impact.

	- 8/12-Safely make the implicit explicit (even when it is messy).
	  
	  You have a strategy right now. It just might not be explicit. The bets are there, but unclear. Surfacing what is can go a long way.
	  
	  "So it appears as if our strategy is making this quarter?" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1408959244737466371))
	- 9/12-Use safer experiments.Â Hack the status quo (nicely).
	  
	  Do both.
	  
	  If you're asked to Build X, hack a one-pager that shows X as a potential solution. You will not get fired (though you may still need to build X). 
	  
	  "Oh, let's do the velocity thing AND a [[North Star Metric]]" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1408959245811286020))
	- 10/12- Gather a change agent crew. Support each other.
	  
	  You can't do this alone. Find people who are in it for the long term. It'll take a while. Seek diverse perspectives. Seek pessimists and optimists. Build a crew. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1408959246742425600))
	- 11/12- Don't become a figurehead. You'll be easier to dismiss.
	  
	  This isn't about you. Be a catalyst and make the change advocacy effort decentralized and hard to pin down. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1408959247677747202))
	- 12/12- Laugh about it and take care of yourself. Consider the product of you.
	  
	  This is one job of hopefully a long, rewarding career. Don't beat yourself up and get bitter. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1408959248587886595))
