	  Abe believed in Ralph. Mel takes over the company. Mel's his son-in-law. Mel does not believe in Ralph. He doesn't want to change anything. He's like no this is there's no design business and ties. You just sell ties like we've been selling forever. What is wrong with you kid? Right? And Ralph's like oh I have to leave here. I can't like get my ideas out into the world. This isn't going to work. And so I says Ralph was different says Mel. If everybody was clean shaven Ralph wore a beard. When the industry was selling skinny ties Ralph had to wear a wide one. And so unfortunately the founder of the company the owner of the company dies. The one that was supporting him says Abe Rivets died on the same day that Ralph and Ricky Lauren married. So I think Ralph was around 24 years old at this point. When Abe died I went back to Mel and said Mel I'd like to design the ties. And he said there's no such thing as a designer in our business. Mel thought Ralph was an amateur. What bothered Mel the most was that he thought Ralph spent too much time talking about clothes instead of selling ties. He was supposed to be a neckwear salesman for us. But I found he was spending a lot of his time talking to tailors. Ralph could spend hours talking about the location and dimension of belt loops on trousers are the size of pocket flaps. Why the hell is the kid talking to somebody about belt loops? You know what popped to my mind when I got to that paragraph one of my favorite quotes ever. It is a quote that I try to live up all the time. Mediocrity is always invisible until passion shows up and exposes it. Mel is mediocre.
