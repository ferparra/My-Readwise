	- Why now?
	  
	  If you're a founder, you've heard his question from investors again and again. But how essential is it to have a strong "why now", and why does it even matter? After studying the why now's of dozens of companies, here's what I've learned 🧵👇

	- 1/ A strong why now creates two types of advantages for a startup:
	  
	  (a) Unlocks the ability to provide a 10x better product, through the ubiquity of new tech (eg. @figmadesign and WebGL), newly available data/APIs (eg. @MapQuest and nav DBs), or changes in regulation (eg. @eaze) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1417873324852482049))
	- (b) Creates a new untapped market need, through change in people’s behavior (eg. @Clubhouse and COVID), or change in people’s beliefs (e.g. @coinbase and faith in crypto) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1417873326207242241))
	- 2/ You can build a massive business without an immediate why now. 
	  
	  Companies like @SpaceX @Pinterest @Airbnb @DoorDash and @netflix (DVD version) had little if why now. They each succeeded in large part because they were able to build a 10x better product irrespective of timing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1417873327230644225))
	- 3/ Your why now can emerge later
	  
	  For many companies, there was no real why now when they got started, but the world changed around them and gave them a wave to ride: @PayPal and mobile payments, @netflix and broadband, @Facebook and digital camera adoption, @Airbnb and recession ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1417873328304320513))
	- 4/ "I think of markets like currents, not whether or not they are big bodies of water. The stronger the current, the higher your chance of success." — @sarahtavel ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1417873329466220546))
	- 5/ "The importance of the ‘why now’ has a lot to do with the reason venture capital exists. Venture capital works because there is justification for being an unprofitable company at the outset because... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1417873331970134019))
	- ...the opportunity later on is so huge, compounded by the fact that getting in early enables the startup to gain advantage." — @annimaniac ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1417873334839037952))
	- 6/ "Of course any startup benefits from the tightest definition of why now—if the company literally couldn’t have existed without the ‘why now.’ Uber would not have been possible without smartphones + GPS. But great companies can also just ride one or more trends to success... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1417873335787036679))
