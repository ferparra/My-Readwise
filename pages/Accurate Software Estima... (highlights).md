	- Accurate software estimation is a nerdy passion of mine...
	  
	  Ten years ago when I first became a tech lead I realised how shit I was estimating large projects.
	  
	  Since then I have improved massively, I can now estimate a 12-month project with high accuracy.
	  
	  Some learnings

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Most software projects go overtime due to a misunderstanding of customer needs, and not fully understanding their real problems.
	  
	  First rule of estimation is...
	  
	  Don't estimate until you know exactly what you're solving.
	  
	  Boring but true. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrisrickard/status/1531024866555617280))
	- 2Ô∏è‚É£ To start, I break down every facet of the project into User Stories with detailed acceptance criteria. 
	  
	  I then have one (or many!) workshops with the client to run through these. I then amend where required, and eventually get official acceptance (client sign-off). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrisrickard/status/1531024868782878725))
	- 3Ô∏è‚É£ I then use a custom estimation template I developed, and create a row for each User Story, sometimes breaking it out into multiple rows if there is specific research or obvious seperate components to a story. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrisrickard/status/1531024871182024707))
	- 4Ô∏è‚É£ I make sure to capture every activity.
	  
	  Scoping, research, wireframes, workshops, test cases, manual testing, user testing doc creation, infrastructure, 3rd party service integration, logging, data migration, deployments, project management, comms etc.
	  
	  Don't miss anything. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrisrickard/status/1531024879125921794))
	- 5Ô∏è‚É£  I then use three point estimation technique (PERT), and do an optimistic estimate, pessimistic estimate, and realistic estimate - for every item.
	  
	  Before incorporating PERT all my estimates were really just "best case scenario"... that's how time overruns creep in. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrisrickard/status/1531024881130807301))
	- 6Ô∏è‚É£ Lastly, but integrally - I get a multiple opinions.
	  
	  I get a teammate or friend to do their own estimate using the tasks I broke down, and we discuss the differences.
	  
	  I often incorporate their opinions into mine, as we all have our own biases that sneak in. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrisrickard/status/1531024883722895362))
	- Estimation is an art,  and I hope some of this was interesting to you üôÇ
