document_note:: This text discusses James Scott's skepticism of "high modernism" and its belief that societies can be designed and operated by scientific principles. Scott explains how the state imposes schemes to make it easier to keep track of things and maintain order, even though this is not always good for the people. He also discusses how optimizing for one variable to be efficient often leads to disaster, and how the state's desire for control, ease of use, and legibility often lead to overly simplistic and potentially harmful outcomes.

	- State projects of simplification and legibility
	  
	  1.  Planned social services always fail as they can’t possibly take into account all variables and things emerge anyway
	  2.  Optimizing for one variable to be as efficient as possible often leads to disaster. See monoculture farming. The state does something similar in that it takes what is locally optimal (but illegible) and transforms it into something that doesn’t represent reality but is legible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt0ay9m4qm8rze4e8n2tq8m1))
		- **Note**: State projects aimed at simplifying and making systems more legible often lead to disaster as they do not take into account all variables, leading to unintended consequences. This is often seen in monoculture farming, where optimizing for one variable leads to disaster. The state does something similar by taking what is locally optimal, but illegible, and transforming it into something legible, but not reflective of reality.
