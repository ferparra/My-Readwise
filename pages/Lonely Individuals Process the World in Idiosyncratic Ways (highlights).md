document_note:: This study found that individuals with high levels of loneliness process the world in an idiosyncratic way. This was evidenced through functional MRI and the UCLA Loneliness Scale which showed that lonely individuals had dissimilar neural responses to audiovisual stimuli than their peers. This was seen in brain regions associated with reward processing, shared interpretations of events, and attentional orienting. This suggests that processing the world differently from those around oneself is linked to loneliness.

	- Humans have a fundamental need to belong and connect socially ([Baumeister & Leary, 1995](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976221145316#bibr2-09567976221145316)). When this need to belong is not met, there can be devastating consequences. It is well-established that loneliness (i.e., the distressing feeling that often accompanies subjective perceptions of social disconnection) has detrimental effects on the well-being of individuals, including an increased risk of mortality that persists even after controlling for comorbidities ([Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976221145316#bibr14-09567976221145316); [Shankar et al., 2011](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976221145316#bibr35-09567976221145316)).

	- Feeling understood by other people is one critical factor for achieving social connection ([Reis et al., 2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976221145316#bibr31-09567976221145316)) and is associated with greater life satisfaction ([Lun et al., 2008](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976221145316#bibr22-09567976221145316); [Reis et al., 2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976221145316#bibr31-09567976221145316)), more positive evaluations of interactions with strangers ([Cross et al., 2000](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976221145316#bibr8-09567976221145316)), and increased fulfillment in close relationships ([Oishi et al., 2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976221145316#bibr28-09567976221145316)). In one study, feeling understood activated brain regions that are associated with reward processing, whereas not feeling understood activated brain regions that are associated with negative affect ([Morelli et al., 2013](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976221145316#bibr25-09567976221145316)). Self-report data also suggest that there is an association between loneliness and not feeling understood by other individuals ([Routasalo et al., 2006](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976221145316#bibr32-09567976221145316)). Such findings suggest that not feeling understood by other people may be a risk factor for loneliness. However, it is unknown whether lonely people actually see the world in ways that are dissimilar to others in their community (rather than, e.g., exaggerating how dissimilar others’ views are to their own), which may contribute to feelings of disconnection due to a lack of shared understanding.
