	- 1/ I'm a big fan of frameworks.
	  
	  This weekend I was updating my "personal operating system" frameworks. I've become a fan of Excalidraw recently, so I figured I would sketch something out.
	  
	  It's by no means mutually exclusive or complete, but I think it's a good starting point.

	- 2/ I've separated it into 2 parts: homeostasis and growth (forgive the lack of biological correctness)
	  
	  Homeostasis is about being okay with where I am right now and having stability and freedom (however one might define it)
	  
	  Growth is about ampliflication & having more to share. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1513513701453692938))
	- 3/ The most important for me is doing part 1 well, i.e. find & maintain personal homeostasis.
	  
	  My goal is to do more "satisficing" than "maximising". Personally, this means having a clearer view of what my most important pillars are, and what "enough" looks like in those pillars. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1513513704435855361))
	- 4/ I have definitely struggled with maximising in the past. 
	  
	  The maximiser mindset is usually focused on growth, which can often come at the expense of the pillars in homeostasis (particularly mental well-being and strong relationships). 
	  
	  Often the root is deep dissatisfaction. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1513513707816382470))
	- 5/ It's also really easy to get sucked into things unconsciously without really understanding what the point of the next step is. 
	  
	  Been in a relationship for a few years? Let's get married. Been married for a few years? Let's have kids.
	  
	  In the end, dissatisfaction is amplified. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1513513710676963339))
	- 6/ It's important to distil down exactly what your needs are.
	  
	  Bringing in some pop-psych from Maslow's hierarchy, homeostasis would ideally satisfy up to the level of "love/belonging" for me, arguably the most important part.

	- 7/ We should also be careful of the needs requiring external validation (i.e. "esteem")
	  
	  Whilst denying the impact of external validation in our lives is probably too high and lofty, making our well-being contingent on that validation is a recipe for disaster. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1513513720810409986))
	- 8/ The last level of self-actualisation is also a strange concept. Viktor Frankl says it best:
	  
	  "...what is called self-actualisation is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more one would miss it." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1513513723540873218))
	- 9/ Changing tack slightly, there's no doubt that the growth journey can be exceptionally rewarding. It is often where we find most of our stimulation and engagement.
	  
	  It's a good practice, though, to unpack our underlying motivations and pursue growth cautiously (and consciously) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1513513726359445505))
	- 10/ I would be interested to hear how others think about "growth" particularly. I'm perhaps a bit disenchanted ðŸ™‚
	  
	  Any "aha" moments on your journeys around the sun? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1513513729110859776))
