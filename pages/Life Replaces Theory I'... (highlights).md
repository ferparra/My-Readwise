	- Life Replaces Theory
	  
	  I've been rereading [[Dostoevsky]]'s Crime and Punishment. This time more from a psychological perspective than a literary one, let's say.
	  
	  The following comment, which I found on a YouTube video from all places, expounds well on the novel's central message. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trsam97/status/1477449169828679680))

	  Raskolnikov had a view of humanity as being divided into two groups: the great men who are allowed to violate morals (like Napoleon), and the normal people may are not allowed to violate them. He did consider himself as one of the former group. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trsam97/status/1477449171758059523))
	- But here's the catch: the former group, like Napoleon, never felt bad about what they did. Yet when Raskolnikov murders the women, he could not help but feel bad. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trsam97/status/1477449173691551744))
	- And that's what haunted him; that he is actually part of the second group, and therefore, he really was wrong to kill them. Even at the very end, he says he still holds to his theory.
	  
	  Yet Dostoevsky makes a point that is a lot more subtle. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trsam97/status/1477449175449026561))
	- In the last chapter, "life replaced theory": Raskolnikov simply let go of his reasoning around this and simply accepted that he is wrong without explanation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trsam97/status/1477449177244180481))
	- This may or may not be illogical, but the point is that life, true life, surpasses all of these theories which drive you to these horrific acts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trsam97/status/1477449179135823873))
	- As he said in one of his works - and make of it what you wish - is that if it could be shown that Christ is outside of truth, then he would still side with Christ. It is this deeper reality that he was concerned with. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trsam97/status/1477449180977139713))
	- Also, he wasn't motivated in his murder for any selfish reasons, that he somehow deserved the money because he is "better". Raskolnikov was very altruistically motivated: use the money to get an education and then help people, use the money at the moment to help people.

	- Selfishness is one trait he didn't have. He was constantly motivated to help others even though he appeared extremely morose. He wanted to help his sister, the prostitute, her father, the average person.

	- Strangely, I realised yesterday that this was my most heartfelt lesson from 2021 too. So, my only new resolution in 2022 is to try and live life as it entirely is but not as some abstract theory I conjure up in my head.
	  
	  Happy new year! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trsam97/status/1477449186823921664))
