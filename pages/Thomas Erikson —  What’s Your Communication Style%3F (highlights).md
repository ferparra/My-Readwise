	  This is how it is, because even though you have different cultures, even though you have different cultures, culture, sort of black and sort of everything, people on an individual level are the same, basically all over the world, that is good news, we are not so different as we might imagine. People like to say, oh, we're so polarized, well, maybe we are, but we are at the same time to say, I'm not going, you know, I'm not trying to be some sort of prophet here, but it's really uplifting to realize this. I mean, in Germany, people, the German culture here in Europe, they are blueish, it's kind of an engineer, engineering, kind of world, you know, if you go into the subway in Berlin, and the train is for the seven seconds late, the whole platform is doing like this, you know, tapping their watch on the drive, they're feeling bad, you know, and everything, you know, others in the ordinary, all the time in the US, you are more extroverted, obviously you are better to present yourself, you are better to sell yourself to the public, you are much, much better to talk about yourself and lift up your strengths, which I admire, that would make you more, more yellow and red, I would say. In Sweden, we have a green filter on top of everything. So here everybody's nice, try to be kind, and we agree, we are very agreeable, very agreeable as a people. So we are sort of closing our fist in our pocket, you know, grinding our teeth and say, that's a really good idea. But again, when you reach down through the culture of field shows, and you lift up off the blanket, you realize that on an individual level, people are exactly the same.
