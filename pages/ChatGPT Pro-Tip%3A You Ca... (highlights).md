	- ChatGPT pro-tip:
	  
	  You can do a LOT with ChatGPT output if you add this to your prompt:
	  
	  "You only speak JSON. Do not write text that isn't JSON." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1654997713354907648))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- JSON is a structured way to store and represent data.
	  
	  It stands for JavaScript Object Notation.

	- Once you have JSON output, it's easy to write functions that process it any way you want.
	  
	  The name of the game is getting output in a consistent format that doesn't change.

	- And with a bit of JavaScript, I was able to turn that output into a thread draft in @NotionHQ.
	  
	  This thread would still need some editing before going live, but ChatGPT did about 70-80% of the work turning my ramblings into a draft.

	- P.S. - this tweet thread automation will probably become a tutorial.
