	- Loved @chamath's interview with @ShaneAParrish. 
	  
	  He hit on two keys to maintaining mental health:
	  
	  1. Have people to discuss problems with (therapist/friends)
	  
	  2. Get together with a small group of close friends on a weekly schedule—no excuses, same time weekly
	  
	  Helped me a ton.

	- A lot of people miss one key thing about remote work:
	  
	  Running a Remote Company ≠ Working From Home
	  
	  It means the freedom to set your own work hours, work from anywhere (cafes, travel, co-working) and live where you want.
	  
	  COVID work from home is not an accurate picture. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/awilkinson/status/1317911134704340992))
