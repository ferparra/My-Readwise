	- Product market fit is just narrative distillation for customers.

	- There are three types of fundraising pitches:
	  
	  Narrative - driven by a compelling story of what could be
	  Inflection - secrets discovered w ideal risk-adjusted time to invest
	  Traction - past results
	  
	  The dirty secret is that there is no such thing as traction pitches anymore.

	- Sequencing to Multi-Product / Platform.
	  
	  You either die a single product company, or live long enough to be multi-product or a platform. This is the inevitable path for almost every successful company.

	- Narrative distillation is a core part of Company Building.
	  
	  Narrative is entwined with progress. Narrative is shaped by each iteration of a companyâ€™s processes and products. And in turn a companyâ€™s evolving narrative shapes how it focuses its processes and builds its products. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/batkomichael/status/1449536395844808706))
	- Money is a resource to derisk.
	  
	  Historically, capital was the scarcest resource. VC was built around capital scarcity as the most important blocker on success.
	  
	  But increasingly it isnâ€™t scarce anymore. And it certainly isnâ€™t the main blocker for many of the top companies. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/batkomichael/status/1449536398193672201))
	- Money is ironically one of the easier parts of building and derisking.
	  
	  Hiring + retaining a talented team is far harder.
	  
	  Acquiring + retaining customers is harder.
	  
	  Understanding + coordinating the team what to build is harder.

	- This is the CEOâ€™s job.
	  
	  To raise and allocate the capital needed, but also to build a team capable of building the product needed and getting distribution. All while understanding what the company needs to build and helping the team understand and orient around it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/batkomichael/status/1449536403050696706))
	- Whoâ€™s in charge of that narrative?
	  
	  There is no team that owns the narrative of a company. No team that determines its atomic concepts. This is why we often see large disagreements within a company on how to think about itself.
	  
	  Some of these differences are natural.

	- After all, customers care about different aspects of a company than its investors.
	  
	  And employees in different roles may have good reason to be focused on different timescales.
	  
	  At most companies, only the CEO or founders can shape and reshape narrative. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/batkomichael/status/1449536409325371393))
