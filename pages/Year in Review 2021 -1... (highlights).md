	- YEAR IN REVIEW 2021-3
	  Pandemic killed >1m in the US (adj >reporting).  Instead of working on substitutes to gov for systemic risks, Covidopaths are *now* claiming "govt grab".
	  
	  It's like refusing firefighters *during* a fire on grounds of libertarianism.

	- YEAR IN REVIEW 2021- 4
	  Spent >3m in Lebanon during 2021. Once you take it as it is not as it should be, and avoid interactions with geopolitical  BS vendors or diaspora moaners, it is monstrously OK.  Helped w/my ancestral village's localism.
