	- Questions to Ask Yourself Regularly
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Questions are more adaptable than advice, and help to improve selfawareness and bring back to center., * Things that are important to you will change over time, so it is important to revisit what is important to you.)

	  They're very adaptable to the context and that's something that's different and perhaps a little bit better than advice. Advice is actually kind of brittle and context dependent. Somebody can have a really good plan a really good piece of advice to give you but if it doesn't fit your context then it's actually not great advice for your particular situation whereas questions are very adaptable. So I think maybe what I should do is just go through some of the questions that I like to ask myself for my annual review and throughout the rest of the year. So I guess we could say this first category is just kind of like questions that help improve self-awareness or help kind of bringing back to center. So like the first thing I think actually this might be a question from Derek Sivers or some version of it from him. Just what am I optimizing for? Sometimes people optimize for money, sometimes optimize for free time, sometimes they optimize for creative output or being able to choose the projects they work on, all kinds of stuff but that answer probably changes over time. What I'm optimizing for today is different than what I was optimizing for five years ago or 10 years ago. So I think it's a helpful question to keep revisiting and you need to decide what it is for you otherwise it's easy to kind of slide into this status signaling or just kind of like doing the things that you feel like you're encouraged to do by society or by your friends or peers or your parents or whatever. So what am I optimizing for? Another way of phrasing that is maybe like what's the real objective here? Like what am I actually trying to achieve? So some version of that question. I also like does this activity fill me with energy or drain me of energy? You can tell a lot just by whether it like fills up your cup or not. And ideally you'll be spending more time in the next year on things that fill you with energy and less time on things that drain you with energy. Speaking of the things that drain you maybe like a sub question that I like to keep in mind is does the amount of attention I'm giving this match its true importance? And man there's so many years when I find that I'm giving something a lot of attention that actually is not that important. And it's nice to check in and kind of course correct that.

	- The Person who chooses their information flow wisely has better, more original thoughts
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* The main focus should be on crafting better information flows, as this will help to create better thoughts., * It is important to consume from highsignal sources, as this will help to avoid low-signal information., * It is important to be selective in what we choose to consume, as this will help to avoid being overwhelmed by information.)

	  I'm trying to craft better information flows. Almost every idea that you have is downstream from what you consume. We don't usually think about it that way but like when you choose who to follow on Twitter you're choosing your future thoughts in a sense you're creating the information flow what the timeline what the feed is going to look like or when you choose what book to read or which podcast episode to listen to you're choosing the thoughts that are going to arise. Now you may not necessarily know what they are but over time you can start to learn which sources of information are higher signal than others and I almost feel like that is like the main habit to try to build especially in our current modern society because information is overflowing and so widely accessible. The person who creates better information flows gets better thoughts. ([Time 0:23:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e74c1459-be8d-402e-aa5c-8459fa249196))
	- How to make habits stick: make them obvious, attractive, easy, & rewarding
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* People should make meditation more obvious, attractive, and easy to do in order to increase the likelihood of practicing regularly., * Adding positive emotions (such as feeling good after practicing) can also help to increase motivation to continue practicing.)

	  How would you suggest people approach saying meditating in the morning a couple things to think about here so again let me just run through the the four laws real quick just as a primer for this answer so if you want to build a good habit roughly speaking there are four things that you can do you want to make it obvious you want to make it attractive you want to make it easy and you want to make it satisfying so obvious attractive easy satisfying now if you're sitting there and you're thinking how can i get myself to meditate more you can just turn those into questions and you can say how can i make the behavior more obvious how can i make it more attractive how can i make it easier how can i make it more satisfying and you'll start to notice different things that You could do so for example how can i make meditation more obvious well do you have a clear space where you're going to do this you know like maybe you need a meditation pillow and it's in the corner of your bedroom or it's in the corner of some other room that is the dedicated meditation space and this is exactly where it happens so it's obvious where the behavior is going to occur make it attractive there are many different types of meditation and there are a lot of ways to get into it and this is true for any habit by the way for some reason i think we often choose habits that we feel like we should do but it's not necessarily the one that we want to do individually and you know there may not necessarily be a thousand ways to do everything in life But there's almost always more than one way and you should choose the version that you're most genuinely excited about you know that is most appealing and interesting to you because if you're genuinely interested in it then there's gonna be all kinds of ways to improve you'll find all sorts of things that you could like it refine or make it better but if you're not actually interested if you're like not genuinely engaged in the task even the obvious stuff is going to feel like a hassle you know it's going to feel like a chore even if it's straightforward so do you want a guided meditation maybe it'd be nice to have somebody kind of walk you through it or do you want to find a meditation that has like lovely music associated with it do you not want anything do you just want silence and you Want to be able to like hear yourself think for a minute or listen to your own breath for five minutes and that's kind of the objective but what sounds most attractive and appealing to you try to find a version of the habit that you're actually interested in this actually i think connects to the timing piece that you were talking about tim which is yeah in the morning is a great time for a lot of people but if you have young kids and like your four-year-old is running around and you're trying to figure out how to get pants on them and you need to make you know breakfast but like that's probably not a good time to do it so like find a time and a space where that habit can live where it's attractive and you're not just going to end up frustrated because you're Trying to like swim upstream make it easy so rather than doing 15 or 20 minutes or 30 minutes of meditation which hey that sounds great because your favorite guru does it but listen like why not just do 60 seconds because if you can master the art of showing up if you can just do it for a minute and actually stick to that day in and day out then you're starting to build the habit and now you have something you've like gained a foothold and you could advance the next level one of the things I recommend in the book is called the two-minute rule and it says just take whatever habit you're trying to build and you scale it down to someone who takes two minutes or less to do so read 30 books a year becomes read one page or meditate five days a week For 30 minutes becomes meditate for 60 seconds and you're just trying to master the art of showing up a habit must be established before it can be improved it's got to become like the standard before you worry about optimizing it into some perfect thing so make it easy to do make it easy to show up and then the final thing is make it satisfying now if you've done those first three steps well it's obvious it's an attractive version of it it's pretty easy to do you're probably going to feel pretty good about yourself because you're at the end of the meditation session now so like that'll probably be pretty satisfying but you can layer on some kind of additional benefit maybe you get to have your favorite type of coffee or your favorite drink after that or maybe you get to have a bubble bath Or walk in the woods or whatever sounds motivating to you so find some way to to add some additional positive emotions to the experience because if you feel good about it you're going to want to repeat it and this is something that in atomic habits I call it the cardinal rule of behavior change which is behaviors that get rewarded get repeated and behaviors that get punished get avoided and it's so basic it's so obvious but all humans want to feel good you know we all want to have positive emotions to be supported to be loved to be rewarded to have something that feels good and so how can you get that feeling and associate it with your habits that's kind of the the core idea and ultimately this connects back to what we talked about with identity which is the perfect version is when you Perform a habit and you feel good because it's reinforcing your desired identity you know I'm the type of person who wants to meditate each day or I'm the type of person who doesn't miss meditation sessions and then even if it's only 60 seconds you can feel good about doing it because it's reinforcing your desired identity so that's kind of a quick case study on how to apply the ideas ([Time 1:11:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8cc0e3bc-8518-42dd-983d-cd67d9bab28e))
