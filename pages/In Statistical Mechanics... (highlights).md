	- In statistical mechanics the key function describing any system is its 'partition function' - I'll explain that soon.
	  
	  Imagine a gas of 'primons', one for each prime, and say the primon p has energy ln(p).   The partition function of this gas is the Riemann zeta function!

	- To get the 'partition function' of a system, sum exp(-E/kT) over all states where E is the energy of the state, k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.
	  
	  If you work this out for the primon gas, you get the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) where s=1/kT.

	- It's fun to imagine a canister containing a gas of prime numbers popping in and out of existence, with the energy of a collection like 2, 2, 3, 7 being ln(2) + ln(2) + ln(3) + ln(7).  From its partition function we can compute its entropy, its specific heat, and so on.

	- Heat it up!   When T approaches the 'Hagedorn temperature', the partition function diverges as arbitrarily large collections of primons become likely.   It's impossible to go above this temperature.   This corresponds to the pole of ζ at s=1.

	- This blog article by students formerly at Australian National University explains the primon gas and computes its energy as a function of temperature.  The answer is -ζ'(s)/ζ(s).

	- So far our primes have been bosons, since we can have as many copies of the same prime as we want in our canister.
	  
	  This blog article explains how the story changes if our primons are fermions... or if we allow both bosonic and fermionic primes:

	- You're probably wondering: can these ideas help us prove the Riemann Hypothesis?   So far the answer seems to be "no".   So far these tricks seem too superficial - not deep enough to give surprising new math results.
	  
	  But they're still fun.
