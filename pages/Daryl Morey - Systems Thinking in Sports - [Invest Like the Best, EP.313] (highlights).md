	- How to Drive key Outcomes
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* In order to win in any game, it is important to first identify what the main drivers of success are., * Once you have identified these drivers, it is then important to focus your efforts on optimizing for them.)

	  In so many of these examples where you're entering a new game and you're trying to win just like in a simplest sense, it sounds like the thing that you would advise people first to is identify what you're optimizing for. Like in basketball, you need a superstar. And I'm sure there's layers of nuance beneath how much more is LeBron and his prime worth and like the second best player and stuff like that. And I'd be curious about that. But in general, is that the strategy that you would advocate that you spend the first chunk of time saying like, OK, wait a minute, what determines outcomes in the first place? And then let's build around that.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, it's basically KPIs to steal the business term. I see different sports all the time. And that's 100% the first question I ask. What is your first layer? And the NBA was the first thing I did when I got the job in the NBA with the Celtics in 2002 was OK, we know winning matters. What drives winning? Point differential drives winning. Duh. And we knew that from baseball and I had done that work in the NBA. Well, it's that thing. What drives point differential? Oh, it's number of possessions times your efficiency of using each possessions. Pretty basic. Number of possessions, rebounding and turnovers. Shooting is a combination of both the mix of threes and twos that you shoot and the outcome of that. And then also, do you get to the line and how efficiently do you make the free throws? What are the leading indicators of those? OK, then it's are you in transition or not? Every question that I'll get in the sport, I'll say, I don't know. You don't know the answer to. So you have to do that first. I met with some key soccer, Bill. I won't say the Premier League team in the mid 2000s who are looking to do advanced things. And I was like, OK, well, your first thing, we know goal differentials are the matters, but you have very few goal events. So you have to then first break down every shot into sort of an expected point. So you're going to get from that goal. They at the time are claiming to be very advanced, and they didn't have an answer to that. And I was like, well, you guys have nothing. You have no way of knowing anything until you get that. So they do have that infrastructure now, and now they're working on the secondary and tertiary problem. So you need to know what are your KPIs and then what are the key drivers of those?
