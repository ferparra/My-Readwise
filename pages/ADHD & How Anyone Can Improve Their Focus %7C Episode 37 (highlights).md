	- Default vs Task networks
	  
	  Summary:
	  Now, normally, in a person without ait h d, the task networks and the default mode networks are going in connocesaw fashion. They are actually what we call anti correlated. So it's not just that they are not correlated, they are actually opposing one another. They are anti correlated. In a person with a d h d, the default mode net works and the task net works are actually more coordinated.

	  That's how it is in a typical person. In a person with eiht h d, or even a person who has sub clinical ad h or in any human being who hasn't slept well, what you find is the default mode net work is not synchronized. These brain areas are just not playing well together. Now, the task networks include a different set of structures. It still involves the pre frontal cortex, but it's a different part ([Time 0:30:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/20a7cba4-001c-47a2-9346-8fd40b8e7b30))
	- How to Get Better at Focus
	  
	  Summary:
	  i'm going to share with you a tool for which there are terrific research data, that will allow you, in a single session, to enhance your ability to focus. What i'm about to read you is from an excellent book that i recommend if any of you are interested in ero science and things like meditation and default mode networks. And know iam not to try and convince you to meditate,. i'm going to shared with you a small passage in the book that relates some research data related to focus that are very important. I'll put a link to it in the caption. The title of the paper is, oligo antogenic di improves children's ei d h d

	  Aderall, they are tapping into the circitres and the ner chemistries that mediate attention and focus. They are not the only alternatives, or the only choice. Is rather, for treatment of these circuits and enhancement of the circuits for focus. I want to talk about other alternatives and some behavior alternatives that are not very well known, but are very, very effective, in a few minutes. But i really want to make this clear distinction between modulation and med ation, because it's vital for anyone that's trying to modulate or mediate anything within their own brain. If any of you are interested in this oligo antogenic diet as it relates to a d h d, and you want to explore a more recent study, besides that classic two thousand 11 lancet study that's rather controversial, there a paper that was published in frontiers in psychiatry just last year, 20 20. The title of the paper is, oligo antogenic die improves children's ad h d rating scale scores reliably in added video rating. The added video rating is just that they're using an additional measure of focus. And again, that's frontiers in psychiatry 20 20. I'll put a link to it in the caption. And that's a more recent study for you to peruse. So we've talked about the neural circuits of focus and the chemistry of focus, but we haven't talked yet about ([Time 1:10:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/48d5fb90-5243-40d0-a0a0-b824bade0a17))
