	- 1) Is it really true that some ways of solving social problems achieve 100s times more given the same effort?
	  
	  A thread on all the data I could find.
	  
	  First, @tobyord ‘s original paper, which finds global health interventions ~perfectly follow an 80:20 distribution:

	- 2) Toby found the top 2.5% of health interventions produced:
	  
	  * 52 times more years of healthy life per dollar than the median
	  * 11 times more than the mean.
	  
	  Now 10 years later, how well does this pattern hold up in other studies, and beyond global health?

	- 3) We checked against other reviews of global health, finding very similar results.
	  
	  For instance, by WHO:

	- 4) Then we expanded from developing countries to rich countries.
	  
	  And found a very similar pattern.

	- 5) OK, what about if we go beyond health?
	  
	  We found a review of 370 US social interventions inc. criminal justice reform, education etc.
	  
	  Again, a very similar pattern.

	- 6) And similar for education in the developing world:

	- 7) And climate change policies:

	- 8) Overall Toby’s finding seems to hold up surprisingly well:
	  
	  Wherever we found large datasets of cost-effectiveness, we found something like an 80:20 distribution.
	  
	  Typically the top 2.5% are ~10x the mean and ~100x the median.
	  
	  (Though some smaller datasets show less spread)

	- 9) Then the question is what these results imply.
	  
	  It’s tempting to think you’ll be able to have 100x the impact by switching from typical to best.
	  
	  I've heard people in effective altruism say 1,000x is possible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ben_j_todd/status/1625545961224257561))
	- 10) But it's normally fairer to compare the top with the *mean* rather than *median*, since the mean is what you end up with if you pick randomly.
	  
	  The top are only ~10x the mean rather than 100x. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ben_j_todd/status/1625545962935533577))
	- 11) Moreover, the effectiveness of the top are probably overstated, after you take regression to the mean fully into account. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ben_j_todd/status/1625545965137543197))
	- 12) On the other hand, these data sets only cover *measurable* interventions.
	  
	  Historically, the very most effective interventions have been hard-to-measure things like R&D or advocacy.
	  
	  If these were added, the true spread would be larger. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ben_j_todd/status/1625545967276638218))
	- 13) My take is by carefully choosing a solution (with a hits based approach), you can increase your impact about 10x compared to picking randomly.
	  
	  This makes it less important than picking the right problem area in the first place, but still very important. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ben_j_todd/status/1625545969558339592))
	- 14) Overall I think the importance of these differences has been overstated by those interested in effective altruism, but is still very underrated by the world at large.
