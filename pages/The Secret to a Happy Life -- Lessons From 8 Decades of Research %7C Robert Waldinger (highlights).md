	  And this is interesting, we asked people who were our original participants in our study, we asked them who could you call in the middle of the night if you were sick or scared? And many of our people could list several other people they could call, if they were in trouble. Some people couldn't list anyone. There wasn't a person on the planet who they could turn to if they were sick or scared. And what we find is that having at least one person in your life who you feel really has your back, who you could go to if you were in trouble, that's essential for maintaining our happiness and our health. When we asked these same people when they got to be in their 80s to look back on their lives and to tell us what they were proudest of, almost everybody said something about their relationships. They didn't say I made a lot of money or I won some big awards. They said I was a good mentor, I was a good friend, I raised healthy kids, I was a good partner. And so what we find is that what seems to mean the most to people when they get to the end of their lives is the strength and the warmth of their connections to others. So then the question comes up, well, which types of relationships support our well-being? Some people have asked, do I need to be in an intimate relationship to get this benefit?

	  Yeah. One way to think about it is not whether the relationship is smooth all the time, but whether we feel that we can be authentic, we can be ourselves in a relationship. And obviously we won't be the same selves in a work relationship that we might be with our beloved sister. But still, can I be myself in the most essential ways? Can I express myself and can the other person express themselves? Because I think that's where what we really want is to feel known and to feel seen and not to feel like we are having to maintain a facade that hides who we are. And so the best relationships are those where we feel we can be ourselves.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  And you talked about how really it's romantic relationships, friendships, acquaintances. I mean, all of these relationships matter, but do you find that one of these is maybe more significant than the other? Or how do you look at them?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I look at it in terms of the secure attachment we think about. That's attachment is a word for being warmly, securely connected. It's the who can you call in the middle of the night if you're sick or scared?
