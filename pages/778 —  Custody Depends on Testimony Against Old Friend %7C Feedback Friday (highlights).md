	  I've recently been going through something of a therapeutic breakthrough in no small part thanks to your show. I've been able to process most of my traumas, understand what's happening in my own mind, and build a healthier outlook on life. One unexpected side effect of this growth, however, has been a reintroduction of anger into my emotional life after a long time. Because of my past trauma, I learned to internalize blame for situations large and small, and often felt guilt rather than anger. This new anger is never unjustified. I've always had a strong sense of justice, whether it's a co-worker who makes an insensitive comment, or a simple mistake that ends up doing real harm to somebody, I now find a seething white-hot rage where before I felt nothing. My conscious mind knows to wait until I can think clearly, approach the person from a place of compassion and understanding, and try to reach a healthy and positive outcome. So, what does a healthy relationship with anger look like for most people, where you allow yourself to attribute blame to the appropriate parties without having a meltdown? And what's the best way to channel this disproportionate feeling of rage towards something positive, signed, calibrating my mind, and staying benign, as this feeling comes back online? Fuck it, man.

	  Let it fly. Fuck them. They're fucking morons. But seriously, fucking great question. But for real, first of all, congrats on all this amazing work you've done. I think that's really inspiring. I do love that the show has played a small part in that. That is awesome. You sound like a really curious and thoughtful person. I am sure that that's a big part of this breakthrough that you're having. So, yeah, this is actually kind of fascinating. When you start working through your stuff, when you get in touch with parts of yourself that were punished or denied or somehow cut off, you often find yourself in touch with all sorts of feelings. For some people, it's fear. For some people, it's shame. And for a lot of people, it's anger, man.

	  Yeah, especially people who deal with depression.
