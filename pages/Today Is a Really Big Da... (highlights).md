	- Today is a really big day at Descript üéâ
	  
	  First, the all-new version of Descript is now available to everyone. Second, we're announcing that the @OpenAI Startup Fund is leading Descript‚Äôs $50 million Series C.

	- Let‚Äôs start with the product release. Here's a tour: https://t.co/D1Kq1xp9wW
	  
	  We're reimagining the way video editors are designed. So they're no longer just for creative professionals, but a tool that‚Äôs in everyone's communication toolkit - right next to docs and slides.

	- But to pull that off, we don‚Äôt think it's enough to just take an ugly old timeline editor and move it to the cloud and make it collaborative or whatever. 
	  
	  Because timeline editing will always be a grind, especially next to working with text üìù

	- So if we want people to be as prolific with video as they are with docs and slides, then the tools need to be as fast, intuitive and flexible as docs and slides.
	  
	  More than ever, that is what we are trying to do with this new version of Descript that we're releasing today.

	- Before, if you wanted to add visuals to your video, or manipulate them, you had to do it in the timeline (just like in other video editors).
	  
	  Now you can do all of that without touching the timeline, using a new feature we call Scenes.

	- Enter - The new Descript üí•
	  
	  The best way to get your head around the new Descript is to watch our CEO Andrew‚Äôs demo in the video below; there‚Äôs also a demo project in the app that will show you how to use Scenes and some other new features.

	- Where were we - So, whenever you want your visuals to change, just type a slash and then that creates a Scene, which is like a slide in PowerPoint or Google Slides.

	- You can drag b-roll or images onto your Scene ‚Äî including from our new stock media library ‚Äî or apply a template, or add titles or text. 
	  
	  Or you can use our AI green screen to remove your background and replace it with something else.

	- It‚Äôs super fast, and familiar, and even fun üéâ
	  
	  And lest you think it‚Äôs overly simplistic, remember that under the hood, there is still a full timeline editor, plus all the important features that make Descript a mature, capable video editor. 
	  
	  11/21 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DescriptApp/status/1592546911000854534))
	- We‚Äôre really proud of this release, and really grateful to everyone that‚Äôs been trying it out and giving us feedback for months. 
	  
	  We'd love for you support the launch on Product Hunt and share your thoughts: https://t.co/KsHszNkRwR

	- So yeah, you can have it all, because we rejected the choice between making Descript simple or powerful. Instead, we figured out how we could use AI to re-imagine video editing in a way that could be both of those things.
	  
	  Speaking of AI... ü§ñ

	- Our new partner: OpenAI
	  
	  Artificial intelligence is now being used to generate audio, like in Descript, and also text and images and video. It's getting really good ‚Äî and @OpenAI is right at the center of it.
	  
	  Watch below for the details, or keep reading.
	  
	  14/21 https://t.co/r5TFvpcBQu ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DescriptApp/status/1592546993997774848))
	- They have [[GPT-3]] for text generation, which companies are using to generate marketing copy, write code, etc. There's DALL-E, where you just type words and it'll make a picture of those words. 
	  
	  These things are good and useful, and they're getting better at breakneck speed.
	  
	  15/21 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DescriptApp/status/1592546999311937537))
	- In addition to building stuff, OpenAI has set up the OpenAI Startup Fund. They‚Äôre using it to support and accelerate companies that are building useful AI tools in fields like healthcare, education, & creativity. 
	  
	  Descript is now one of those companies.
	  
	  16/21 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DescriptApp/status/1592547001119703040))
	- We guess the folks there saw what we see, which is that Descript‚Äôs model for making video and audio content is not only made possible because of AI, but it also really is the ideal receptacle for this coming explosion of AI-enabled content capabilities.
	  
	  17/21 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DescriptApp/status/1592547002835165186))
	- So much of this crazy progress that's happening in AI is happening in text, audio, and visual generation. And Descript is right at the intersection of those things.
	  
	  So we feel really lucky to have the support of OpenAI.
	  
	  18/21 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DescriptApp/status/1592547004835852288))
	- This AI stuff is going to be transformative. It's going to impact us all before we know it. 
	  
	  There are so many open questions about exactly how it's going to unfold, and we couldn't have asked for a better partner to help us navigate those questions.
	  
	  19/21 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DescriptApp/status/1592547006912024576))
	- Practically speaking, this partnership is going to mean some great new tools coming to Descript in the next year. 
	  
	  The new Descript that we're releasing today is really just laying the foundation for a new kind of video editor. We're excited to keep building it with you.
