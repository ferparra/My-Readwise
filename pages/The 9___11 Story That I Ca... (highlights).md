		- **Note**: Thread
	- born in Cornwall, Rick is a natural soldier & born leader - he joins the British Army in 1956 & serves in Cyprus and Rhodesia as a paratrooper & MP fighting commies
	  
	  encouraged by a friend, he chooses to immigrate to the US out of a sheer desire to destroy communism

	- he lives in a YMCA in Brooklyn, counting days until he can get back in the fight
	  
	  Backed by his friend Dan Hill, he enlists with Uncle Sam in 1963. He wraps up Basic at Fort Dix & OCS at Fort Benning just in time for the shit to go down in Southeast Asia

	- a 2nd lieutenant, he is assigned to 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), best known in popular culture by George Custer's last stand & Kubrick's Ride of the Valkyries scene from Apocalypse now

	- in 1965, Rescorla's unit learns first-hand and early about the horrors to come in Vietnam, landing in the Ia Drang valley and in the first major battle between US & Vietnamese forces were almost immediately surrounded and ripped into shreds by the North Vietnamese Army

	- in battle, Rescorla is a revelation - seemingly everywhere at once, cheering up his men, comforting the dying, rallying troops with an M16 in one hand and M79 grenade launcher in the other - 
	  
	  like fucking John Rambo in real life he singlehandedly destroys a machine-gun nest

	- 41 years later, the US Army Infantry School at Fort Benning would unveil on its memorial walk a statue of Rescorla - the caption on the pedestal says everything about Rescorla as a soldier: "LEAVE NO MAN BEHIND." 
	  
	  but we're getting ahead of ourselves

	- Rescorla comes home, earns his citizenship, and with the GI Bill graduates with a law degree & teaches criminal justice. He doesn't retire from the Army Reserve until 1990, and then takes a job in corporate security for Dean Witter & then Morgan Stanley - in downtown New York

	- A decade ticks by. 
	  
	  In 2000, learning that Moore's book about Ia Drang was being made into a movie starring Mel Gibson, Resorla is deeply uncomfortable with the portrayal of he and other combat survivors as heroes.
	  
	  Rescorla tells his wife curtly, "the real heroes are dead."

	- on duty and at his post at 8:46 AM on September 11
	  
	  the first airplane crashes into Tower 1 next door
	  
	  he ignites with the same sense of purpose as he did 36 years earlier - Rescorla is a man of action
	  
	  his mission: get his team to safety

	- Ignoring orders from the Port Authority to stand fast, bullhorn-in-hand he rapidly moves across 22 separate floors, successfully evacuating 2,687 of the 2,700 Morgan Stanley employees to safety
	  
	  everywhere at once, he urges, pushes, sings Cornish songs - a revelation

	- after several trips his colleague Bob Sloss passes Rick on the 10th floor, heading back up the stairs. Sloss urged him to get to safety himself.
	  
	  "I will as soon as everyone else is out." 
	  
	  the soldier's code: leave no man behind
	  
	  Sloss is the last person to see him alive

	- for me, Rescorla's life epitomizes what we should be as citizen soldiers
	  
	  what we should all strive to be as veterans - ready to serve in ways big and small at a moment's notice
	  
	  the best of us never really take off the uniform

	- "There are certain men born in this world, and they’re supposed to die setting an example for the rest of the weak bastards we’re surrounded with.”
	  
	  the real heroes are dead - may Rick rest in peace, and may God bless & keep everyone touched by 9/11 today
