	- Wow, now you can estimate full-body pose of multiple people with nothing but Wi-Fi signal ü§Ø
	  
	  I can think of 2 killer apps based on this tech:
	  
	  1. Full-body VR gaming with just home Wi-Fi.
	  2. Fall detection of elders in hospital. No cams for better privacy. Saves lives!

	- My PhD advisor @drfeifei‚Äôs lab at Stanford did great works on computer vision-based analytics for senior homes. Falling could be lethal for elders, but we can‚Äôt just install RGB cams everywhere. To preserve privacy, @drfeifei‚Äôs team resorts to using thermal & depth cams.

	- Using existing Wi-Fi devices in hospitals to detect such activity anomalies could be a more natural & economical alternative.

	- One caveat is that the WiFi-based system is still unreliable and underperforms image-based pose estimation. It also requires more than one routers and careful positioning, which makes it less convenient to use. But I think this direction is still very promising & fun.
