	- Early career years are painful. 
	  
	  You feel like an idiot 98% of the time - lost, confused and insecure.
	  
	  I wish I had a cheat sheet of principles for my first job.
	  
	  So I put one together. 
	  
	  Here are 20 things about building a career I wish I knew sooner: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857576397156353))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Principle #1: You’re not the “Strategy Guy”
	  
	  Yet.
	  
	  To be a big picture thinker, you have to earn the respect, trust and credibility of your team first.
	  
	  The only way you can do this is through delivering tangible value.
	  
	  Focus on bringing results, not laying out frameworks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857578963763201))

	- Principle #2: Stay true to your commitments
	  
	  If you make a commitment, see it through. Half-assed problem solving creates more work for everyone.
	  
	  It’s astonishing how quickly you can get ahead if you simply:
	  
	  A. Say you’re going to do something
	  B. Do it
	  C. Repeat ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857581094764545))
	- Principle #3: Get on the scoreboard
	  
	  Identify the low hanging fruit. This can be for your boss, your team or the company.
	  
	  It’s obvious, everybody knows it’s there, but for whatever reason it hasn’t been fixed.
	  
	  Fix it.
	  
	  Why? It shows momentum and creates a rallying point. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857583082573824))
	- Principle #4: Set the tone
	  
	  When I took over Metasys 3 years ago, we had 0 marketing.
	  
	  I told the team that within 90 days, we would have a refreshed brand, logo and website.
	  
	  It energized the team, but more importantly, established we were going to work at a much faster pace. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857585188413440))
	- Principle #5: Figure out what your boss hates and take it off their plate
	  
	  An exercise I like to do is the “Value Venn Diagram”
	- Principle #6: Learn just enough to be dangerous
	  
	  Know a little bit about: (a) how the world works, (b) how your industry works and (c) how the business works.
	  
	  Cross functional knowledge is underrated.
	  
	  If you bring it to the table, you’ll be an asset in any company from Day 1. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857589684555777))
	- Principle #7: Use the “Challenge Framework” to solve difficult problems
	  
	  Every situation is a function of:
	- Principle #8: Make friends
	  
	  People go to bat for people they like. It’s really as simple as that.
	  
	  In a positive case - they’ll go the extra mile to support you.
	  
	  In a negative case - they’ll give you the benefit of the doubt.
	  
	  Being nice to others pays unplanned dividends. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857593845129218))
	- Principle #9: Get comfortable with being uncomfortable
	  
	  If you get advice from enough people, the advice cancels out. You can find 2 smart people to take opposite sides of the argument on virtually every topic.
	  
	  Focus on developing your instincts and trusting your own intuition. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857595745468416))
	- Principle #10: Train yourself to be open minded vs. close minded
	  
	  Open Minded:
	- Principle #11: Fall in love with messiness
	  
	  Most people hate messes and avoid them like the plague.
	  
	  But this is where the opportunity is.
	  
	  If you execute against the opportunity, you'll find this is also where your fastest levers for advancement live. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857599683919879))
	- Principle #12: Put things on paper
	  
	  Writing things down brings clarity to the thought process. 
	  
	  It’s easy to talk about something and build castles in the sky.
	  
	  It’s a lot harder to distill, synthesize, pressure test and then communicate. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857601743323136))
	- Principle #13: The answer is just as important as the process
	  
	  Nobody likes to work with a “know it all.”
	  
	  Don’t compromise on the solution - the best answer is key to driving impact.
	  
	  But getting to the right answer without any buy in or commitment is worthless. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857603798540289))
	- Principle #14: Learn to disagree and commit
	  
	  Eat your ego.
	  
	  Regardless of the outcome of the decision, you need to disagree and commit.
	  
	  Don’t be a sore loser and detractor.
	  
	  Work as hard on the path forward as if it was your own idea. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857605715017729))
	- Principle #15: Find the tension points
	- Principle #16: Speed is always an advantage
	  
	  A question I routinely ask myself is:
	  
	  "What would it take to move 50% faster?"
	- Principle #17: Over communicate
	  
	  Building trust takes time. Until you have an implicit trust formed with your team, you need to over communicate.
	  
	  I've seen so many careers fall apart on communication.
	  
	  Get the work done AND keep people in the loop from beginning to end. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857612916649984))
	- Principle #18: Be a team player
	  
	  You are now at the bottom of the totem pole.
	  
	  No task is beneath you. All that matters is the team wins.
	  
	  Sounds easy in theory, but it's pretty hard in practice.
	  
	  If you can keep this attitude though, you will stand out big time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857614846087169))
	- Principle #19: Become a master at sales & negotiation
	  
	  Every opening is a sale - partnerships, recruiting, vision, fundraising
	  
	  Every close is a negotiation - hiring, alignment, price, terms, value
	  
	  The faster you can become a sales/negotiation jedi, the better served you'll be. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857616570208256))
	- Principle #20: Find "your thing"
	  
	  Meditating. Sports. Junkie TV. Reading.
	  
	  Whatever it is.
	  
	  Have a release that you can go to to recharge.
	  
	  It'll keep you on track / the journey sustainable.
	  
	  Otherwise you'll burn out. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1490857618730254337))
	- And that's it!
