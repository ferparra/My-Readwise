	- The most powerful reflection you can do:
	  
	  The Monthly Review.
	  
	  Most people go their *entire* life without reflecting—and before they know it, years have gone by and it's too late to change.
	  
	  So don't let this happen—grab a pen, crack open a notebook, and answer these 5 questions:

	- Your monthly reflection:
	  
	  1. What were my biggest wins?
	  
	  2. What were my biggest realizations?
	  
	  3. What areas am I most satisfied? Least satisfied?
	  
	  4. What am I going to do more of this month? Less of?
	  
	  5. What am I thinking about for the upcoming month?
	  
	  Let's explore these: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1576576153359368192))
	- The goal of the monthly review:
	  
	  Block 60 minutes to slowly process the month.
	  
	  It's easy to get caught up in the day to day & lose sight of the bigger picture.
	  
	  And after trying 1000+ reflection questions, I chose each question for a specific reason.
	  
	  Let's start with the first: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1576576158451343360))
	- 1. What were my biggest wins & milestones?
	  
	  These are things that you will look back on with pride & fond memories at the end of the year.
	  
	  • Health wins
	  • Business wins
	  • New relationships
	  • Goals accomplished
	  • Fun memories & events
	  
	  Here's why you start with this one: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1576576163538997251))
	- Recapping wins & milestones kicks the review off on a positive note.
	  
	  So often, our focus is on the negative.
	  
	  But this questions helps us celebrate all the things going well!
	  
	  And it also creates a "ledger" of wins from the year.
	  
	  From there, you ask a more important question: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1576576168635109382))
	- 2. What were my biggest realizations?
	  
	  I used to call this my "biggest losses."
	  
	  But I reframed this—because something is either a win, or it teaches you about the world.
	  
	  And by constantly collecting these realizations, you are always learning.
	  
	  Here are some examples: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1576576173680852992))
	- Most of my realizations are about my:
	  
	  • Health
	  • Beliefs
	  • Business
	  • Lack of skills
	  • Relationships
	  
	  By constantly iterating and distilling these lessons, you will level up month after month after month.
	  
	  From here, you go from looking backward to looking at the present: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1576576178844049414))
	- 3. What areas am I most satisfied? Least satisfied?
	  
	  Split the page in 2 columns and brain dump bullet points of everything that comes to mind.
	  
	  The goal here is to identify in the [[present moment]] what's working and what's not working.
	  
	  From there, you ask another question: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1576576183847845890))
	- 4. Based on these areas, what am I going to do more of? Less of?
	  
	  This is the 80/20 rule in action.
	  
	  20% of your:
	  
	  • Habits
	  • Beliefs
	  • Friends
	  • Actions
	  
	  Are leading to 80% of both your positive *and* negative results.
	  
	  And the goal here is identify them, so you can do this: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1576576188839088134))
	- Now you should have 2 lists:
	  
	  • Things to *double down* on that are bringing you the positive results
	  
	  • Things to *stop doing entirely* that are bringing you the negative results
	  
	  Put those lists somewhere you can see them every morning (for me, that's on my bathroom mirror). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1576576193834401795))
	- Alrighty—you started reflecting on the prior 30 days.
	  
	  Then you reflected on the present.
	  
	  Now, it's time to think about the future.
	  
	  Which brings us to your final question: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1576576198905368576))
	- 5. What am I thinking about for the month ahead?
	  
	  This is a quick list of things you're:
	  
	  • Excited about
	  • Thinking about
	  • Uncertain about
	  
	  This turns into a letter to your future self you can read at the end of the month.
	  
	  And just like that, the review is complete! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1576576204026650624))
	- The beauty of this process is you can constantly capture these things throughout the month.
	  
	  • Wins & milestones
	  • Realizations & decisions
	  • Things going well & things to improve
	  
	  Then, at the end of the year, you collect these monthly reviews and distill the entire year! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1576576209059778565))
	- To recap, reflect on these questions every month:
	  
	  1. What were my biggest wins?
	  
	  2. What were my biggest realizations?
	  
	  3. What areas am I most satisfied? Least satisfied?
	  
	  4. What am I going to do more of this month? Less of?
	  
	  5. What am I thinking about for the upcoming month? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1576576214046842880))
	- And that's it!
