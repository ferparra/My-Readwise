document_note:: In this document, it is argued that wisdom is an important part of our meaning making processes. It is seen as a meta-psychotechnology, which involves both propositional and non-propositional knowing, such as procedural, perspectival, and participatory knowing. It involves the ability to see through illusion, which is a systematic insight that is part of higher states of consciousness. It is cultivated through the use of a reflective equilibrium, which looks at both philosophical and psychological theories.

The main difference between Religio and Credo is that Religio refers to a spiritual or religious experience, while Credo refers to a set of beliefs or doctrines. Credo is closely linked to propositional knowing, and is used to set criteria on Religio. Credo is often expressed through creeds such as the Nicene Creed or the Apostles' Creed. Religio, on the other hand, is open-ended and linked to an inexhaustible, open-ended optimization rather than a final solution.
