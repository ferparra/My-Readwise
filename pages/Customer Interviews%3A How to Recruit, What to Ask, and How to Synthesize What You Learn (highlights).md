document_note:: Customer interviewing is an important activity for product teams to undertake in order to understand their customers and what they need. This guide covers the basics of customer interviewing, such as who should conduct them, how often they should be done, and how to find customers to interview. It also outlines the types of questions to ask and not ask, how to collect specific stories, and how to communicate with stakeholders on what is learned. It is recommended to interview at least one customer every week and to create an interview snapshot for each interview.
