	- Takeaway #2 - Long term brain health
	  
	  Some recent studies suggest that poor sleep contributes to higher levels of beta-amyloid protein in the brain, which lead to the amyloid plaques found in the Alzheimer's brain.
	  
	  If you want a healthy brain avoid long term sleep deprivation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1652297268031102980))

	  • When deprived of sleep avoid making big decisions & pause before reacting to an emotion.
