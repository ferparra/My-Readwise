	- there are 2 types of [[ambition]] 
	  
	  1. Specific: you know you want to be a doctor or have a particular site for your energy. you know how to direct your [[energy]]
	  
	  2. Unspecific: you have a lot of [[energy]] but are not sure where to put it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/startingfromnix/status/1597735810207399937))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- when you compare yourself to people with specific energy, it feels like unspecific energy is “directionless” or perhaps even “not ambitious” 
	  
	  but when unspecified ambition is nurtured, pruned, directed properly , you can create something truly special ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/startingfromnix/status/1597735813415985152))

	- I used to have all this energy and wondered if I was being ambitious enough, daring enough. Turns out I was unspecifically ambitious. I need a place to put this ambition or else it gets split up and fractured and not fully utilized ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/startingfromnix/status/1597735819326160896))
