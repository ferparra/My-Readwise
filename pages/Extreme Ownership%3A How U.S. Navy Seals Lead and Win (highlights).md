document_note:: Extreme Ownership is a leadership mindset that emphasizes taking responsibility and ownership of everything in one's world. Blas Moros outlines the principles that top leaders must embody such as buy in, simple and clear instructions, decentralized command and prioritizing. Leaders must be mission-focused and avoid ego and personal agendas. Combat is reflective of life, only amplified and intensified. Leaders must align their thoughts and vision to that of the mission, have a standardized planning process, lead up and down the chain of command and act decisively amid uncertainty. Discipline and balance are key characteristics of a good leader, who must also have the humility to admit and own mistakes. Leadership is an extremely challenging yet rewarding undertaking.
