	- **Fugue:** A fugue is like a canon, in that it’s based on one theme which gets played in different voices, but the notation is much less rigid and you can play with it more. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcdv5gfpt6h6bvs40qe8at4))
	- Bach created an “endlessly rising canon,” in which it ends and immediately restarts but a note up. The transition is seamless, and allows it to continue rising forever. **This is the first example in the book of a “Strange Loop,”** a loop whereby moving through it we unexpectedly find ourselves right back where we started. Such as in the famous Escher paintings like the infinite staircase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcdvkj318q62h6px73y0gjf))
	- You can think of a record as an *information bearer* and the record player as an *information revealer*. Alternatively, a molecule of DNA is a set of information (genotype) which is converted into a physical organism (phenotype).

	- Intelligence depends on the ability to create high-level descriptions of complex arrays, such as chess boards, printed pages, or paintings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcdxbq4w6yya8ahwkkt2f6k))

	- We’re all bundles of contradictions, and that’s a natural function of our brain, being able to hold contradictions comfortably. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcdy361r6qf11bny0fb9q6r))
