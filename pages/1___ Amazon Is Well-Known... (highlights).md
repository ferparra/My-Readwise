	- 1/ Amazon is well-known for its writing culture: 
	  
	  ‚óªÔ∏è "Mock press releases / FAQs" for new product pitches 
	  ‚óªÔ∏è "6-page memos" instead of Powerpoint 
	  
	  It force clear thinking and encodes a specific approach to innovation (especially for a post-Bezos world). 
	  
	  Here's a breakdown üßµ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1412067606605926402))

	- 2/ The "Working Backwards" philosophy 
	  
	  Instead of creating a product then finding customers, Amazon asks "What does the customer need?" and works *backwards* toward the product. 
	  
	  ‚úîÔ∏èCustomer need --> Create product
	  ‚úñÔ∏èCreate product --> Find customer ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1412067607750930446))

	- 3/ Write a mock press release 
	  
	  To determine if the customer need makes biz sense, employees write a press release:
	  
	  ‚óªÔ∏è What problem is the new product solving
	  ‚óªÔ∏è Why it's better than existing options 
	  
	  To persuade a customer, the document has to be jargon-free and tell a story.

	- 4/ Press releases force big thinking 
	  
	  You don't write a press release for an incremental improvements.
	  
	  Creating a product worthy of a press release means really solving a customer problem and going after markets with large total addressable markets (TAMs). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1412067613102936064))
	- 5/ Include an FAQ in each "press release" 
	  
	  Addressing every potential customer question can help identify hurdles to getting something to market...and also uncover other potential opportunities. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1412067614189264897))
	- 6/ Why memos over Powerpoint?
	  
	  Amazon famously has execs write 6-page narrative-driven memos instead of Powerpoint decks.
	  
	  The practice began in 2004 when Jeff Bezos noticed nothing was being decided after 60-minute long meetings with his inner circle (AKA S-Team). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1412067615804100613))
	- 7/ Memos > Powerpoint #1: More info density
	  
	  People read faster than people can talk meaning that -- for a 60 minute meeting -- reading a memo before discussing an issue conveys much more information (10x more per a former Amazon exec). 
	  
	  Narratives are also much more memorable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1412067617817333764))
	- 8/ Memos > Powerpoint #2: Ideas instead of charisma 
	  
	  In Powerpoint presentations, a great presenter can sell a bad idea. Conversely, a poor presenter may be unable to sell a great idea. 
	  
	  In a memo, the idea wins. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1412067620245757952))
	- 9/ Memos > Powerpoint #3: Better analysis 
	  
	  Powerpoint's hierarchical (and sequential) structure is not ideal to address complex issues. 
	  
	  Narrative-driven memos can be multi-causal and provide a 360-degree view on a topic. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1412067621508247557))
	- 10/ Memos > Powerpoint #4: Focusses a meeting 
	  
	  If every meeting participant spends the first 1/3rd of a 60-minute meeting reading, there is a huge transfer of information. 
	  
	  It's a forcing function to get everyone on the same page and makes the remaining 40-minutes high quality. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1412067622670139400))
	- 11/ Memos > Powerpoint #5: Shared understanding 
	  
	  Whether or not one agrees with everything in a memo, focussed reading of a document provides a shared knowledge base with which to begin discussions. 
	  
	  Further, someone can quickly "get up to speed" by reading past memos. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1412067624389775364))
	- 12/ Memos > Powerpoint #6: Decisions need narrative
	  
	  Powerpoint and Excel are great at communicating data.
	  
	  However, at the executive level, you are making complex decisions and leading. This requires a mastery of narrative (AKA memo writing) to persuade stakeholders. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1412067625757151234))
	- 13/ Writing is crucial for a company scale 
	  
	  At 20 employees, Bezos could be in every meeting. At 1k+ employees, he needed a way to ‚Äúinject his lens of thinking‚Äù into the organization. 
	  
	  An archive of writing (e.g. annual letters) encodes thinking, especially now that he's gone. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1412067629183897604))
	- 14/  Here is the email from Bezos saying "No Powerpoint" (June 9th, 2004). 
	  
	  In it, he emphasizes the importance of "narrative structure" and says Powerpoint "gives permission to...ignore the [[interconnectedness]] of ideas."

	- 15/ Follow @TrungTPhan for other business breakdowns and really dumb memes, like the time I read all of Bezos' annual letters and summarized them in one tweet: https://t.co/1GpABCI1IU ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1412067637522173960))
	- 16/ The insights are from "Working Backwards", a fantastic book written by 2 former Amazon execs (Colin Bryar, Bill Carr).
