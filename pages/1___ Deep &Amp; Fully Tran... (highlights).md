	- 3/ In terms of addressable market, Covalent serves every person, project and blockchain that needs data querying. Since January of this year, they’ve grown from 20 Million Monthly API calls to 142 Million API calls in March ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rewkang/status/1387903189194788867))
	- 4/ At current, we often see decisions being without access to insightful data; this is due to a myriad of factors from incomplete data to low-data literacy levels ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rewkang/status/1387903190276902914))
	- 5/ When we found out that Covalent builds out-of-the-box analytics for everyday users, we knew they were a crucial missing piece in the data infrastructure vertical. By removing the need for custom code, they allow any DeFi user to make data-backed decisions ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rewkang/status/1387903191338061828))
	- 6/ From day 1, Covalent’s unified API has been designed for mainstream adoption while their no-code solutions empower people to easily extract blockchain data ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rewkang/status/1387903192537653249))
	- 7/ They rebuilt MongoDB’s aggregation layer in-house and bolted it into the Covalent API to address both the limitations of GraphQL and REST. These native aggregations and custom endpoints make working with Covalent more accessible to the 5+ million developers who know MongoDB

	- 8/ Further, they are the only project to fully index entire blockchains (every single contract, wallet address and transaction) with a focus on indexing as many different blockchain networks as possible. This allows data to be analyzed cross-chain and as granularly as possible ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Rewkang/status/1387903196664934402))
