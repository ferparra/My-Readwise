	- Skin in the Game by @nntaleb is one of my all-time favorite books.
	  
	  It‚Äôs key to rethinking education.
	  
	  Here‚Äôs why ü™°üëáüèº

	- [[Nassim Taleb]] is an expert on [[probability]] and real-world [[risk]].
	  
	  He‚Äôs written a series of books on how to make decisions under [[uncertainty]].
	  
	  The capstone volume is on skin in the game, the idea that those who make a decision should also shoulder its risks.

	- In life, our choices have consequences, both good and bad.
	  
	  [[Skin in the game]] means WE bear those consequences.
	  
	  As a result, we end up learning much more from trial and error. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anafabrega11/status/1441414142817030151))
	- In essence, skin in the game creates a system for error correction.
	  
	  When we make choices, we‚Äôre not only rewarded for good results.
	  
	  We‚Äôre also accountable to handle the fallout when things go wrong. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anafabrega11/status/1441414144687812610))

	- It might seem like school does this well: kids who do poor work earn poor grades.
	  
	  Report cards seem to give kids skin in the game‚Äîbut it‚Äôs a game they fundamentally don‚Äôt buy into.
	  
	  It‚Äôs skin in the game of school.
	  
	  And the game of school is much different from the game of life. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anafabrega11/status/1441414146206015493))
	- As we say at @synthesischool, kids are hungry for the real thing.
	  
	  They don't want more worksheets and assignments. 
	  
	  They want to solve problems that mirror the *real* world.
	  
	  They want stakes that matter to them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anafabrega11/status/1441414148043288581))
	- However, letting kids tackle real problems means also allowing them to wrestle with the results of their decisions.
	  
	  After all, that's the hardest part of real-life choices:
	  
	  Managing the second-order effects.

	- From a distance, this might sound scary, but skin in the game actually makes learning:
	  
	  ü§ìeasier
	  üß†more memorable
	  ü§©and more exciting
	  
	  Here‚Äôs why: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anafabrega11/status/1441414153797779456))
	- First, [[skin in the game]] makes [[learning]] easier.
	  
	  When the stakes are high, our bodies direct all our energy to our brains üß† 
	  
	  Our mental vision clears.
	  Our thoughts focus.
	  Our [[motivation]] kicks into gear. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anafabrega11/status/1441414155269918723))

	- Second, skin in the game makes learning more memorable.
	  
	  Our brains sear what we learn from hard experience into our neural networks.
	  
	  Those lessons stick with us for life! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anafabrega11/status/1441414156771594241))
	- Third, [[skin in the game]] makes [[learning]] more exciting.
	  
	  As Taleb says, he didn‚Äôt care for statistics in school, but then he learned about options trading.
	  
	  All the sudden, his knowledge of probability meant the difference between making and losing millions of dollars! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anafabrega11/status/1441414158046597128))

	- Of course the key to better education isn‚Äôt putting kids in charge of large investment portfolios.
	  
	  We need ways for them to experience high-stakes scenarios that mirror reality without the possibility of life-changing failure.
	  
	  That‚Äôs what @josh_dahn created for @synthesischool ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anafabrega11/status/1441414159279788034))
	- Synthesis started as conundrums‚Äîtough questions for kids to discuss, like how to build a @Tesla supercharger network.
	  
	  But Josh intuited that kids learn more with skin in the game. 
	  
	  So he turned the conundrums into competitive simulations.

	- In Josh's original conundrums, learning never moved past conversation.
	  
	  But in his simulations, kids could practice implementing their ideas and responding to the downstream effects.
	  
	  Moreover, they‚Äôre real winners and losers.
	  
	  Competition creates real stakes! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anafabrega11/status/1441414162161311745))
	- Most importantly, the Synthesis simulations give kids problems that are fun to solve.
	  
	  They get to run movie studios, put out wildfires, colonize space, collect art, fish the oceans, and so much more.
	  
	  After all, skin in the game only works if kids actually care about the game. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anafabrega11/status/1441414163436290049))
	- Kids who learn from skin in the game are much better prepared for the real world.
	  
	  They know choices have consequences, many of them unpredictable, and they're ready to dive into the challenge. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anafabrega11/status/1441414164694638595))
