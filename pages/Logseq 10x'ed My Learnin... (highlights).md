	- Logseq 10x'ed my learning process.
	  
	  I remember more, hold my attention longer, and create a personal knowledge base of practical knowledge all at once.
	  
	  But it‚Äôs easy to overcomplicate things.
	  
	  Here‚Äôs how I use @logseq to manage learning projects and acquire skills, fast ‚¨áÔ∏è ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1603375788077686784))

	- Why should you even bother planning your learning projects?
	  
	  Shouldn‚Äôt you just start learning?
	  
	  No ‚úã
	  
	  Unless you learn for the sake of learning, you probably have a goal in mind. But without a plan, it's unlikely you‚Äôll even move in the direction of your goal. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1603375790669762561))
	- Learning is all about process, but no process is useful if you don‚Äôt know your goal.
	  
	  Seneca said it best:
	  
	  "If you don't know what port you're sailing to, no wind is favorable."
	  
	  Pick a worthy goal, find the skill to reach the goal, take the shortest way to master the skill. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1603375793219850241))
	- Why use @logseq to manage your learning projects?
	  
	  Because it‚Äôs easier.
	  
	  If you already take your notes somewhere, why not also manage your tasks there?
	  
	  I treat every piece of learning content as a task that needs my attention. So, I plan it where I take my notes: in Logseq. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1603375795799396353))
	- So how do I actually plan and run my learning projects with @logseq?
	  
	  1) I set my goal
	  2) I scope resources
	  3) I execute my learning plan
	  4) I regularly review my progress
	  
	  Let‚Äôs see (with screenshots) how I do things üëá ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1603375798299131904))
	- I treat every learning goal as a project.
	  
	  A project has a start date and a specific outcome I want to achieve by an end date.
	  
	  Once a learning project is done, I make sure to revisit it over time. This is important for skills that I want to turn into habits.

	- Here's how I scope learning resources:
	  
	  1) Reference the resource in my task list
	  2) Set a goal for the resource
	  3) Study the resource
	  4) Review the goal
	  
	  Because every learning project is a project, every resource becomes a task or even a mini project in itself.

	- Executing my learning plans is easy.
	  
	  Because I reference resources as tasks on my journals page, I know each day what to study. I generally plan one day ahead.
	  
	  When it's time to study, I:
	  
	  1) Open the video's block
	  2) Take (timestamped) notes
	  3) Add screenshots
	  4) Link freely

	- Every learning project needs an outcome.
	  
	  I've set my goal, but it's easy to get lost studying resources. So with everything I note down I ask myself: "how will I use this?"
	  
	  I link freely so finding back notes is always easy. But I also want to fulfill the goal I set initially.

	- That's it! That's how I use Logseq to learn.
	  
	  This is just one simple example of how I use Logseq to plan and execute learning projects. I use the same system to learn more complex skills, like programming.

	- @craha Both of those are some years old and quite long, so I'll try to distill both in Twitter threads. Thanks for the suggestion üôè ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1603481083760312322))
