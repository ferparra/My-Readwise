document_note:: This book is about the diffusion of innovations, which is essentially a social process in which information about a new idea is communicated from person to person. This diffusion process is affected by different factors, such as perceived relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability. Furthermore, opinion leaders can be incredibly powerful members to have on your side, as they exemplify and express the system's structure. Finally, routinization marks the end of the innovation process in an organization, and sustainability is more likely if widespread participation has occurred in the innovation process.

	- A technological innovation embodies information and thus reduces uncertainty about cause-effect relationships in problem solving ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvwdrg16eg46wqg0kdzya4v))
		- **Note**: A new technology has information inside it that helps us understand how things work and how to solve problems.
	- **(Perceived) Relative advantage** - the improvement one innovation vs. what precedes it, perceived > objective advantage
	  
	  1.  Many adopters want to participate actively in customizing an innovation to fit their unique situation. Innovation diffuses more rapidly when it can be reinvented and that its adoption is more likely to be sustained
	  2.  Taking into account people's perception of an innovation cannot be overstressed
	  3.  Rationality = using most effective means to reach a goal
	  4.  Fastest routes to adoption come when felt needs are met
	  5.  Mass media has a short, spiky effect on adoption whereas interpersonal communication is more sustainable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvwg2zgdz1jmb7vatfkckj4))
		- **Note**: This document discusses the diffusion of innovations, highlighting the importance of perceived relative advantage, rationality, and felt needs. It emphasizes that adopters often want to customize an innovation to fit their own situation, and suggests that mass media has a short-term effect on adoption while interpersonal communication is more sustainable.
	- **Compatibility** - degree to which an innovation is perceived as being consistent with the existing values, past experiences, and needs of potential adopters ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvwf3vw7yya2qnvf3q61p30))
	- The structure of a social system can facilitate or impede the diffusion of innovations. The impact of the social structure on diffusion is of special interest to sociologists and social psychologists, and the way in which the communication structure of a system affects diffusion is a particularly interesting topic for communication scholars. Katz remarked, "It is as unthinkable to study diffusion without some knowledge of the social structures in which potential adopters are located as it is to study blood circulation without adequate knowledge of the veins and arteries."
	  
	  1.  Opinion leaders thus exemplify and express the system's structure. These are incredibly powerful and valuable members to have on your side
	  2.  A communication network consists of interconnected individuals whoa re linked by patterned flows of information ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvwfbg9aceczh72t7k7s3ea))
		- **Note**: This text discusses how the structure of a social system can affect the diffusion of innovations. It is suggested that opinion leaders play an important role in this process, and that communication networks consisting of interconnected individuals are key to the successful diffusion of innovations.
	- **Complexity** - degree to which an innovation is perceived as difficult to understand and use ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvwf0tq87ewwrq42yyzj0cs))
	- **Trialability** - degree to which an innovation may be experimented with on a limited basis ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvwex3xf4vc94v4394n0489))
	- **Observability** - degree to which the results of an innovation are visible to others ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvwes2h9f80dbjwh297ffxx))
	- **Tactics to reach critical mass**
	  
	  1.  **Highly-respected individuals** in a system's hierarchy for initial adoption of the interactive innovation should be targeted
	  2.  **Individuals' perceptions of the innovation can be shaped, for instance, by implying that adoption of it is inevitable, that it is very desirable, or that the critical mass has already occurred or will occur soon**
	  3.  **Introduce to intact groups whose members are likely to be relatively more innovative**
	  4.  **Incentives for early adoption of the interactive innovation should be provided, at least until critical mass is reached** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvwcxf8tmv1b3hyzpf9xsts))
		- **Note**: The document suggests various tactics to reach critical mass when introducing an interactive innovation. These include targeting highly-respected individuals in a system's hierarchy, shaping individuals' perceptions of the innovation, introducing it to intact groups with members likely to be innovative, and providing incentives for early adoption until critical mass is reached.
	- Routinization occurs when the innovation has become incorporated into the regular activities of the organization and loses its separate identity. Sustainability, a closely related concept to routinization, is defined by the degree to which an innovation continues to be used after the initial effort to secure adoption is completed. Sustainability is more likely if widespread participation has occurred in the innovation process, if reinvention took place, and if an innovation champion was involved. This fifth stage, routinization, marks the end of the innovation process in an organization ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvwgzkea086s4g3x682vfbj))
		- **Note**: Routinization happens when a new idea becomes part of the regular activities of an organization and is no longer seen as something special. Sustainability is when the new idea continues to be used even after the initial effort to bring it in is done. People are more likely to keep using the new idea if lots of people have taken part in the process of making it, if the idea has been changed a little bit, and if there has been someone championing the idea. Routinization is the last step in the process of introducing a new idea to an organization.
	- Stages in the Innovation-Decision Process
	  
	  1.  Knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, confirmation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvwk1vxm8t2xq8yh6za63y5))
