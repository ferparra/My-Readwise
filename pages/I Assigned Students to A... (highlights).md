	- I assigned students to add 1 article/biblio entry per week to a shared class Zotero library and submit a reflection on how the article/entry relates to class themes. Highly recommend! It's been great to converse about how things they find "in the wild" connect to the class.. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hexatekin/status/1558884867063963648))

	- I just posted a few formats of the basic version of this Assignment I wrote, w/ an open (CC0 1.0) license @internetarchive https://t.co/t1ZuOAv4Ym and might post more formats. I would be honored if anyone adopts/adapt it, and most interested in the results! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ“š ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hexatekin/status/1559326199427448832))
	- I'm trying this assignment now in my class: COMM 164. Behind the Internet: Invisible Geographies of Power and Inequality @UCSDComm. I hope to also make the entire syllabus publicly available soon. The final project was also a lot of fun to design and I'm excited to share it! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hexatekin/status/1559326985603559424))
	- This assignment was paired with an in-class demo where I created a media entry from scratch! @zotero may have additional documentation that could be helpful as supplemental information for different learners just starting to use online group libraries!
