document_note:: Notes on the Synthesis of Form by Christopher Alexander discusses the idea of diagrams, which he calls "patterns", as a key to the process of creating form. Alexander argues that it is possible to create abstract relationships one at a time, and to create designs which are whole by fusing these relationships. He argues that the ultimate object of design is form, and that it is based on the idea of achieving fitness between the form and its context. He also discusses the idea of "small, constant steps" as an ideal form of growth, and emphasizes the importance of avoiding verbal constructs and designing to context. Ultimately, he suggests that the task of science is to give a unified description for every object and phenomenon, and the task of design is to find a unified description that resolves the conflicting forces between the form and its context.

	- Must design to fit the context of its use ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsv724gsck4623p4xhx9xgtf))
	- Plato - "First, the taking in of scattered particulars under one Idea, so that everyone understands what is being talked about...Second, the separation of the Idea into parts, by dividing it at the joints, as nature directs, not by breaking any limb in half as a bad carver might."

		- **Note**: Plato said that when we try to understand something, we should first try to understand it as a whole by gathering all the different parts of it together. Then, we should break it down into smaller parts by dividing it in the places where it naturally fits together, like a good carver. We should not try to break it apart in the wrong places, like a bad carver might.
	- **The ultimate object of design is form...It is based on the idea that every design problem begins with an effort to achieve fitness between two entities: the form in question and its context. The form is the solution to the problem; the context defines the problem...The context is that part of the world which puts demands on this form; anything in the world that makes demands of the form is context.** Fitness is a relation of mutual acceptability between these two. In a problem of design we want to satisfy the mutual demands which the two make on one another. We want to put the context and the form into effortless contact or frictionless coexistence ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsv73ccc9kp7w8pnkschccvb))
		- **Note**: This document discusses the concept of design, stating that the ultimate object is form. It states that the design problem begins with an effort to achieve fitness between two entities - the form in question, and its context. Context is anything in the world that makes demands of the form and fitness is a relation of mutual acceptability between the two. The goal of design is to put the context and the form into effortless contact or frictionless coexistence.
	- It is the aim of science to give such a unified description for every object and phenomenon we know. The task of chemistry (and it has been remarkably successful in this) is to relate functional and formal descriptions of chemical compounds to one another, so that we can go backwards and forwards between the two, without loss in understanding. The task of physiology has been to relate the functional behavior of the body to the organs we observe in anatomy. Again, it has been reasonably successful. The solution of a design problem is really only another effort to find a unified description. The search for realization through constructive diagrams is an effort to understand the required form so fully that there is no longer a rift between its functional specification and the shape it takes...**A design problem is not an optimization problem. In other words, it is not a problem of meeting any one requirement or any function of a number of requirements in the** ***best possible way.*** **For most requirements it is important only to satisfy them at a level which suffices to prevent misfit between the form and the context, and to do this in the least arbitrary manner possible** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsv7772hqf44gd69236m2zbx))
		- **Note**: The goal of science is to explain all the objects and things we know. Chemistry helps us understand how different parts of chemicals fit together so that we can go between them without getting confused. Physiology helps us understand how the body works by looking at the organs. Design problems are like puzzles where we need to figure out how all the pieces work together. We need to make sure that the form of the design meets the needs of what it is supposed to do and that it is not too difficult to make.
	- Any state of affairs in the ensemble which derives from the interaction between form and context, and causes stress in the ensemble, is a misfit ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsv74f8cvmhmyczny1vsx17x))
		- **Note**: Notes on the Synthesis of Form states that any combination of form and context that causes stress in an ensemble is considered a misfit.
	- Th organization of any complex physical object is hierarchical. It is true that, if we wish, we may dismiss this observation as an hallucination caused by the way the human brain, being disposed to see in terms of articulations and hierarchies, perceives the world. **On the whole, though, there are good reasons to believe in the hierarchical subdivision of the world as an objective feature of reality.** Indeed, many scientists, trying to understand the physical world, find that they have first to identify its physical components, much as I have argued in these notes for isolating the abstract components of a problem. You cannot understand the human body until you recognize the nervous system, hormonal system, vasomotor system, heart, arms, legs, trunk, head, etc. You cannot understand chemistry without knowing the pieces of which molecules are made ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsv756bae8cckb5tap2ks3n7))
		- **Note**: The text suggests that there is an objective truth to the hierarchical subdivision of the world, as evidenced by scientists' attempts to understand physical components of the world. It is argued that to understand the human body one must recognize the various physical components, and similarly, to understand chemistry one must recognize the pieces of which molecules are made.
	- This is the general rule. Every aspect of a form, whether piecelike or patternlike, can be understood as a structure of components. Every object is a hierarchy of components, the large ones specifying the pattern of distribution of the smaller ones, the small ones themselves, though at first sight more clearly piecelike, in fact again patterns specifying the arrangement and distribution of still smaller components. Every component has this twofold nature: it is first a unit, and second a pattern, both a pattern and a unit. Its nature as a pattern specifies the arrangement of its own component units. It is the culmination of the designer's task to make every diagram both a pattern and a unit

		- **Note**: This rule says that every part of something, whether it looks like a piece or a pattern, can be thought of as different pieces put together. Every object is made up of many pieces, with some bigger pieces helping to determine how the smaller pieces fit together. Each piece is both a unit and a pattern. Itâ€™s like a puzzle, where the pattern of the pieces helps to show how the other pieces fit together. The designer's job is to make sure each puzzle piece is both a pattern and a unit. Just like a wave and a molecule, everything is made of many different pieces.
