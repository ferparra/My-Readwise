	- Do masks work?
	  
	  Recently, some ppl have started claiming it's proven that they don't. Is this true? 
	  
	  I dove into the details, went to the sources, and what I found was so ridiculous it was FUNNY:

		- **Note**: Thread
	- From the article (edited):
	  The most rigorous analysis of studies on the efficacy of masks was published last month. 
	  
	  “There is just no evidence that masks make any difference, full stop. Makes no difference — none of it,” said the Oxford epidemiologist who is its lead author ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1630000804936466433))
	- That's a hardcore statement. So let's dive in. What's this study? You can find it here:
	  
	  It's a Cochrane analysis (gold standard approach) and found 78 relevant studies (impressive!)

	- Let's zero-in on the masks summary:
	  
	  This is a bit intimidating, so let's break it down

	- There are 3 groups of studies:
	  1. Flu/COVID-like illnesses: probably masks work (0.95 means it's 5% below 1, but we're not sure because the range is -16% to +9% infections with masks
	  2. Lab-confirmed: masks increase infections by +1% 
	  3. Lab-confirmed non flu/COVID viruses:-42%!

	- But that's not saying "masks don't work". That's saying "we don't know if masks work". Quite a different statement! We'll get back to that
	  
	  First, let's dive into the data. What studies matter the most? Those w/ heavy weights
	  Abaluck 2022
	  Aiello 2012
	  Alfelali 2020
	  Bundgaard 2021 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fp7ay5RWAAEYCbW.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1630000811680964608))
	- Abaluck 2022: This is the gold standard of mask studies. These guys looked at 350,000 people!!! And did as random and blind a study they could: thousands of villages got free masks, and thousands of other villages also got mask training. -12% COVID in the trained villages. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1630000813450964993))
	- Aiello 2012: 1st thing to notice is the year. This is pre-COVID, when masking science and awareness was much, much lower. 
	  
	  Anyway, what did they do? Study (ONLY!) 1,200 students across campuses in 2007-2008. Here's the result:

	- The study SUPPORTS masks! But somehow, this Cochrane meta-analysis turns it around. Okay.
	  
	  Let's go to the next one: Alfelali 2020
	  Don't let the date confuse you. This is a 2020 study on data *from 2013 to 2015*
	  
	  What did they study?
	  https://t.co/VBZ6fWLyDs ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1630000817167118337))
	- 7,700 (only) pilgrims going to the Hajj those years. They gave some of them free masks and told them to wear them for 4 days (the pilgrimage is usually 5-6 days). If they wore 1 mask 1 day, it counted as a "day wearing a mask". ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1630000818974859267))
	- Now imagine you're a Hajj pilgrim in 2015, before COVID. You receive free masks and are told how to wear them. You'll then hang out for 24h with millions of other pilgrims
	  
	  How well do you think you're going to be wearing your masks?? https://t.co/Zkw8rORAOF ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1630000820581199872))
	- Unsurprisingly, this is what the study concluded: 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fp7emEmWcAAXAKg.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1630000822309232641))
	- But... hoooow does the Cochrane meta-analysis incorporate this info into their meta-analysis? For the 2nd group of studies, they say this study counts for more than one fourth of the impact, and the impact was... Masks increased infections by 40%!!! 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fp7fCXfXoAAxeUM.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1630000824041578497))
	- I mean, they're technically right on that 40%. That's what the study recorded. But they couldn't claim w/ a straight face that masks did that pre-COVID, when nobody had a political opinion about it, or where 2nd order effects ("mask-wearers are too confident!") were very unlikely ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1630000825991942144))
	- OK, onto the 4th and last study, the Danish Bundgaard 2021, the only other COVID-era study (during the height of COVID in April and May 2020)
	  
	  They trained 5,000 ppl to do social distancing, and randomly told a sub-group to also wear masks (and gave them free masks)
	  
	  The result? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1630000827594047496))
	- COVID infections were lower by 18% in the group wearing masks.
	  
	  It's not a lot of ppl, but it's much more recent, post-COVID, controls for "we just did an intervention", was as blind as they could make it... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1630000829414383618))
	- Somehow, these Cochrane magicians mix these 4 studies to find that masks don't work! How do they do that?
	  1. Disregard the original studies' own conclusions
	  2. Count implausible results (+40% infections due to masks in the Hajj? Really?)
	  3. Double the weight of convenient studies

	- Notice how the Hajj and college studies (Aiello and Alfelali) appear in 2 sections. In the 1st, their weights add up to as much as a COVID-era study of 350,000 ppl (this is actually funny)
	  
	  In the 2nd section, since the best study didn't do lab analyses... conveniently absent! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1630000832711122944))
	- There's more! Look what they snuck in:
	  A study that claims masks increase the risk of infection by 150%?! WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT STUDY?! I want to know more!
	  
	  So let's go to it:

	- What does the abstract say?
	  
	  These are true magicians! They took a study that claims that mask adherence significantly reduce the risk of influenza-like illnesses, and then twisted it to say masks increased risks by 150%! 
	  
	  Wow

	- I looked at the Cochrane analysis and can't reconstruct the 2.51 RR
	  
	  I looked at MacIntyre 2009 and this is what I can tell:
	  It's a 2006-2007 (!!) study of 286 ppl (!!!) where a grand total of 17ppl (!!!!!) were infected, and where, as far as I can tell, masks were overall good? 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fp7nACgXoAEeus2.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1630000837765242881))
	- If you just go to these primary studies, you realize NONE of them support the conclusion of the meta-analysis. Brutal.
	  
	  If you adjust the math accordingly, you find that there's just 2 relevant studies (Bangladesh and Denmark), and both say: MASKS WORK ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1630000839531036672))
	- • More fun facts: the 78 RCT studies have a total of 611k participants... More than half from the Bangladesh study!
	  • There are MANY other COVID-time mask studies that showed impressive results. They're not perfect either. But better than theirs?

	- I might be wrong. This sounds so very laughably flawed that I should assume I'm not looking at it correctly. If so, please LMK replying to this tweet here, and I'll correct my thread and upcoming article to reflect it

	- In the meantime, it sounds like very flimsy data to make bombastic statements like the one from the lead author of the study:
	  “There is just no evidence that masks make any difference, full stop. Makes no difference.” 
	  
	  Especially since... It's not what his own study says!

	- As for Bret Stephens, the author of the OpEd, can you point at what I got wrong? And if I didn't, maybe you can follow your own advice:
