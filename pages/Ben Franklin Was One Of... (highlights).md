	- Ben Franklin was one of the most prolific figures of our lifetime.
	  
	  Postmaster, ambassador, founding father. (Oh yea, he filed 1000+ patents, too.)
	  
	  How’d he do it all?
	  
	  Here’s a 2-min breakdown of his top rules for productivity.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- Rule 1 — Set an intention 
	  
	  Ben had a lot going on. 
	  
	  In order to stay effective, he knew he couldn’t focus on everything at once. 
	  
	  So every morning before starting his day, he’d ask one question:
	  
	  “What good shall I do today” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Shane___Martin/status/1507750472840454144))
	- In the real world, doing just 1 thing per day isn’t practical.
	  
	  But prioritizing 1 thing is. 
	  
	  Pick your thing and put it at the center of your day.
	  
	  As you carry out your laundry list of tasks, one of them will have greater gravitational force than the rest.
	  
	  Get it done. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Shane___Martin/status/1507750473884872705))
	- Rule 2 — Have a consistent routine 
	  
	  Most of us make our own schedules.
	  
	  So we all know how tempting it is to only work when we’re “in the mood.”
	  
	  Not Ben. 
	  
	  He knew that establishing a consistent routine was the key to progress. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Shane___Martin/status/1507750474958532612))
	- Try this:
	  
	  For each of your goals, write down 1 thing that must happen every day. 
	  
	  Now go to your calendar and block out time for that task. 
	  
	  Every day, show up and do what you planned…
	  
	  Whether you feel like it or not. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Shane___Martin/status/1507750476116226048))
	- Rule 3 — Work in compartments 
	  
	  Work expands to fill the space it’s given.
	  
	  That’s why Franklin built time constraints into his daily schedule.
	  
	  Every task had a beginning and end. 
	  
	  Embrace the hard-stop and watch your intensity of focus double.

	- Rule 4 — Define your principles
	  
	  Success is determined by the decisions we make from moment to moment. 
	  
	  Want to make better decisions? Define your principles in advance.
	  
	  What are your values? 
	  
	  When you know what you care about, decisions start to make themselves. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Shane___Martin/status/1507750483397468165))
	- Rule 5 — Take time for yourself
	  
	  Franklin was famous for his leisurely 2-hour lunches. 
	  
	  He knew that to operate at your peak, you need downtime to unwind. 
	  
	  Remember that scheduled? 
	  
	  Don’t feel bad about carving out some “me time.”
	  
	  Your creativity will thank you. https://t.co/pHC4egdtBu ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Shane___Martin/status/1507750495401570305))
	- Rule 6 — Track your progress
	  
	  Establishing habits requires consistency. 
	  
	  That’s why Ben built this simple tracker.
	  
	  If you don’t do what you say you’re going to do, you’ll never reach your goal. 
	  
	  Each day, record whether you showed up or not. 
	  
	  Don’t miss 2 days in a row.

	- Rule 7 — Reflect
	  
	  Every night before bed he’d ask himself: “what good have I done today?”
	  
	  Why? Growth requires reflection. 
	  
	  1x per week ask:
