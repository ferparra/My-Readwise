	- Resurfacing & Connecting knowledge
	  
	  One of the important goals of PKM and TfT is to bring back previously acquired knowledge. Bring it back when its needed or bring it back when its relevant to something new we are working on.

	- Navigating documents and arranging tabs and Windows in @craftdocsapp. 
	  
	  This doesn’t seem so important on the surface, but flexibility of arranging your notes and editing multiple documents is a part of a frictionless editing experience.  #TfT

	- The Obsidian Hub is a community developed resource for @obsdmd users. It is impressive. Built with Obsidian and using Obsidian Publish.
	  
	  It is a lot of fun to browse and it really show off  the meaning of “community” in community. #TfT
