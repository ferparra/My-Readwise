	- Resurfacing & Connecting knowledge
	  
	  One of the important goals of PKM and TfT is to bring back previously acquired knowledge. Bring it back when its needed or bring it back when its relevant to something new we are working on.
	  
	  How do you resurface useful knowledge? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1439533676811935748))

	- Navigating documents and arranging tabs and Windows in @craftdocsapp. 
	  
	  This doesn‚Äôt seem so important on the surface, but flexibility of arranging your notes and editing multiple documents is a part of a frictionless editing experience.  #TfT

	- The Obsidian Hub is a community developed resource for @obsdmd users. It is impressive. Built with Obsidian and using Obsidian Publish.
	  
	  It is a lot of fun to browse and it really show off  the meaning of ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù in community. #TfT

	- Cross-reference navigation through your @obsdmd tags and notes
	  
	  Very interesting plugin under development by @alexobenauer. It is worth watching this 3 minute video just to see the concept in use.

	- High praise for @aryansawhney17. He developed SmartBlocks for [[@logseq.]] 
	  
	  I am blown away by his "Ultime Guide to Task Management in Logseq" video. 
	  
	  If you don't need collab, Logseq blow's away Roam. Just saying üòú.

	- An amazing feature of @ReadwiseReader is that it can be navigated almost completely by the keyboard. It sounds unimportant, but it is, it keeps your eyes focused on reading while you navigate through an article, to other articles, etc. #TfT
