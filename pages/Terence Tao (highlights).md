- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Dec 14th, 2022]]
	- * Reflection symmetry -> suffices to test odd and even functions separately.  * Translation invariance -> suffices to test individual plane waves (i.e., to inspect the Fourier multiplier symbol).  * Dilation invariance [if unitary] -> suffices to test homogeneous functions.  * Rotation invariance -> suffices to test the case of spherical harmonic behavior in angular variable (separation of variables).  [This is the case for the MathOverflow post listed above.]
	- * Invariance under linear combinations / convex combinations / algebraic operations -> suffices to check basis elements / extreme elements / generators* Invariance under tensor products -> suffices to check one-dimensional/irreducible case* Invariance under limits -> suffices to check a dense subclass* Multiplicative s
