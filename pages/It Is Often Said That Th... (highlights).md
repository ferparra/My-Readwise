	- It is often said that the West is rich due to slavery and colonialism.
	  
	  But by 1500, long before the Atlantic slave trade and long before England or France have a single colony, Western Europe was far richer than the rest of the world.
	  
	  This divergence, however, began in 1300 AD. https://t.co/i7o1IzlEd4

	- During the Middle Ages the Islamic world was ahead of the Western world intellectually, and was the leader in science and philosophy globally. 
	  
	  By the year 1300 that began to flip, and by the year 1420 the gap became gigantic. The Renaissance was a big deal.

	- This followed from many things, among them the growth of the University in Europe. The first universities were established in Europe just before the year 1100 AD and during the 12th century, but the inflection point is at the year 1200 AD.

	- Examples of early Universities include:
	  
	  1. University of Bologna, established in 1088
	  
	  2. Oxford University, established in 1167
	  
	  3. University of Paris, established in 1215
	  
	  The 4th image is the geographical distribution of universities together with their establishment period.

	- The rise of Western Europe can maybe be best seen in its architecture. After the year 1000 AD and before 1500 AD, almost all of the largest buildings in the world are in Europe.
	  
	  The Lincoln Cathedral and Florence Cathedral, however, each deserve their own attention. See below.

	- The Lincoln Cathedral was completed in 1311. At 525 feet, taller than the pyramids of Giza, it was the tallest building ever constructed. It held that title all the way up until the construction of the Washington Monument in 1884.

	- The first ever recorded patent for an industrial invention was given to Filippo Brunelleschi in 1421. In 1436, Brunelleschi completed the Florence Cathedral, a major milestone in artistic and technological history.
	  
	  It remains the largest brick dome ever built.

	- Along with the rise of Universities, schooling, more generally, increased at least since the 13th century as illustrated for England below. This increase was both in terms of the raw number of schools, but also in terms of schools per capita.

	- One of the largest differences between the West and the rest during this period is in book production. Because of the logarithmic axis, what visibly looks like a linear trend here, actually represents a dramatic exponential increase.

	- The invention of the Verge escapement is one of if not the most important technological development in the late medieval period. Invented in 13th century Europe, this tool allowed for the creation of fully-mechanical clocks.

	- The other most important technological development of the period was Gutenberg’s movable-type printing press, which transformed printing and the proliferation of written materials, and thus human history, forever. Gutenberg is often called "the man of the millennium".

	- While Europe put these technologies to use, Gutenberg’s printing press was famously blocked by religious authorities in the Islamic world, arguably of great importance to the divergence between West Europe and the Islamic world.

	- Easterly, Comin & Gong in 2007 assembled a dataset of national technology adoption in 1000 BC, 0 AD, and 1500 AD, to see the relationship between this with contemporary GDP.
	  
	  In 1500 AD the European average (0.87) is highest among all continents.

	- Here is the overall technology adoption in advanced civilizations for different time periods. In 1500 AD, the West Europe average (0.94) exceeds that of other civilizations.

	- The connection these differences have to contemporary economic outcomes is large.
	  
	  For instance, 78% of the income difference between Europe and Africa is explained just by these differences in technological adoption in the year 1500 AD alone.

	- Slavery was also not very profitable for European countries. At the absolute most, profits from the slave trade and slavery amounted to just 4% of total British GDP.

	- One reason slavery is put forward as an explanation for the Great Divergence, is that people—especially in America—are not taught about slavery which happened elsewhere, outside of the West, in school. Here is a thread I made on the Arab Slave Trade.

	- Even during the peak of the Atlantic slave trade, far more slaves were kept for Africans themselves than were sent to the entire Western Hemisphere.

	- These were the punishments for slaves.
	  
	  As Ahmadou Sehou notes, “it is clear that the range of sanctions is so varied that it has nothing to envy in cruelty and refinement to what was applied to slaves in plantations throughout the Americas.”

	- One of the main arguments against colonialism was that it was so unprofitable, as the colonial balance sheet shows. Virginia Woolf's husband, Leonard Woolf, vociferously argued exactly this.

	- Also, the longer a country was colonized the richer  they are on average. Countries that were never colonized, like Liberia, remain some of the poorest countries in the world, far poorer compared to their colonized neighbors, like the Ivory Coast.

	- On a recent podcast Glenn Loury asked Sylvester Gates if in light of the history of physics, did 16th-18th century Western Europe represent a superior civilization. 
	  
	  Gates replies “I would say that’s kind of obvious”. He then talks about the Big Bang of knowledge in Europe. https://t.co/iNURCxBTOd ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RafFaithfull/status/1641268021783142404))
	- Thank you to @Scientific_Bird for creating this truly amazing piece. Most of the information in this thread is from it, and in case you missed it among my long thread, here it is below. I really recommend you read it. https://t.co/mgO9pFksZu ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RafFaithfull/status/1641298625253744642))
	- Here is a piece by him which I helped to write. It’s about the history of science in Europe. I highly recommend you check it out if that topic interests you. https://t.co/XkwKZCmfjo ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RafFaithfull/status/1641300906749591552))
