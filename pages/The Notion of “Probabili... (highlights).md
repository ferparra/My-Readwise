	- The notion of ‚Äúprobability‚Äù is both familiar (we use it), and mysterious (we would typically struggle to define it).
	  
	  Here is a üßµ to remove the mystery and make the meaning of ‚Äúprobability‚Äù more intuitive.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- When probability is taught in school, a random device, e.g. a üé≤, is usually used as an illustration. We are typically told that the probability of an event is the average frequency this event will be observed if we use this device repeatedly.

	- So the probability of getting a 6 on a üé≤ is 1/6 because if you throw a die many times, on average you will observe ‚Äú6‚Äù one time out of 6.
	  It is a ‚Äúfrequentist‚Äù definition.

	- Because this probability is determined by the geometric properties of the die (its symmetries), it may seem that this probability is ‚Äúobjective‚Äù, a property of the die. https://t.co/dRdr0TNW7M ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/page_eco/status/1558815707500277760))
	- Probabilities have been seen by some as objective properties of the events considered. Here is Charles Pierce (1910) describing it as a property of the die.

	- But this view makes it hard to talk of the probability of a single event which won‚Äôt be repeated. Like:
	  ‚ÄúWhat is the probability Biden will win the midterm elections?‚Äù
	  
	  Following that view, von Mises (1928) considered impossible to talk of the probability of a single  event.

	- Another problem is that you can‚Äôt talk of events which have already been determined but are not known. This issue was the motivation behind this poll: https://t.co/n7Vjtf6cJg ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/page_eco/status/1558815731697205248))
	- And if the world is determinist, then all events are already determined and the notion of probability does not make sense.

	- One solution is to not think of probability as objective but as subjective: a *measure* of our uncertainty.
	  
	  I toss a coin: I saw it landed on Heads. I 100% know it is Heads. You did not see it, you think it is 50%.
	  Same event, different probability, due to different information.

	- Measures are things like:
	  length (measure of distance)
	  area (measure of surface size), 
	  volume (measure of space size),
	  weight (measure of heaviness). Probability can be seen as a measure of uncertainty.

	- In what sense is it really a measure like the other ones? Measures can be defined by a set of mathematical properties. For instance the measure of the length of the sum of two separate segments is the sum of their length.

	- Kolmogorov (1933) defined such principles for probability to be a measure. For instance the probability of the union of two exclusive events is the sum of the events probability.
	  (E.g., the probability to get either 5 or 6 on a die is 1/6+1/6=2/6.)

	- But you‚Äôd be entitled to be sceptic. Length, area, volume, weight are things which can be measured objectively (e.g. using a ruler, a scale). How can we ‚Äúmeasure‚Äù your uncertainty?

	- Well you can! Savage (1954) showed that if you follow a few principles of rationality, you act as if you have beliefs which are a probability measure. So we can ‚Äúmeasure‚Äù your perceived probability by looking at your choices.

	- For instance, consider the bet: You get $100 if ‚ÄúBiden will win the midterm elections‚Äù and $0 otherwise.
	  If you would be willing to pay $20 to play this bet (and no more), then your subjective probability for Biden‚Äôs victory is 20%.
	  (Assuming you are risk neutral for simplicity) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/page_eco/status/1558815781601026048))
	- So amazingly probabilities can be measured!
	  If you follow Savage‚Äôs principles, that is‚Ä¶ In fact most people don‚Äôt. Even Savage was found violating them. üò¨ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/page_eco/status/1558815784293761024))
	- Nonetheless, for those following Savage‚Äôs principles, probabilities can be measured. For the others, decision theorists have designed alternative methods to retrieve subjective probabilities behind people‚Äôs choices.

	- Noticeably, if our subjective probabilities respect Kolmogorov‚Äôs principles, they also respect Bayes‚Äô rule. Nowadays scientists tend to share a ‚ÄúBayesian‚Äù view on probability as subjective and reflecting the weight of our evidence.

	- So to go back to the question in the poll. As a few responses pointed out, both answers are valid depending on one‚Äôs perspective. From an objective perspective, the one you would know everything, the coin is either H for sure or T for sure.
	  But for you, both are 1/2 probability. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/page_eco/status/1558815802220232715))
	- Even though we talk of probabilities as if they are the property of outside events, they are really a reflection of what is inside our head.
