- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- It’s easier to see design problems in someone else’s code than your own.
	- Total complexity = Sum(complexity of part * time spend on that part).
	- Goal of good design: make system obvious.
	- Better modules: interface much simpler than implementation (Deep modules).
	- When designing modules focus on the knowledge that is needed to perform a task, not the order of the tasks.
