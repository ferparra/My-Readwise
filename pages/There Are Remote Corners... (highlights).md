	- There are remote corners of Spain with faster internet than you’ll find in some big European cities.
	  
	  But until recently, these old villages were slowly dying.
	  
	  That's changing––and it's because of remote work.
	  
	  Here's why some people are changing their office views to this 👇

	- People were leaving Spain’s small rural villages by the thousands. It was a no-brainer:
	  
	  ▪️Few job opportunities
	  ▪️Bad internet 
	  ▪️Limited access to online work + uni
	  
	  It’s a big deal––more than 50% of people born in the Soria province, for example, now live elsewhere. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pantherhr/status/1435695976778539008))
	- But lots of these villages have now installed fiber-optic internet––and some have better 5G than what you’d find in Madrid.
	  
	  In a village called Sarnago, in Soria, locals converted an old school into a free coworking space with fast internet.
	  
	  This is happening in many places. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pantherhr/status/1435695979311898629))
	- It’s just like what the United States saw during the past 1.5 years: People leaving big cities to live in smaller towns.
	  
	  In Spain, the people working remotely from small villages are:
	  
	  ▪️People with second homes in the countryside
	  ▪️Students 
	  ▪️Writers and artists
	  ▪️Expats ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pantherhr/status/1435695981878726657))
	- To wrap: This isn’t just Spain. Remote (and importantly, global) hiring lets people work where they want and can help the revival of small villages like the ones described above.
	  
	  So, to close… Would you live and work remotely in a small (< 2,000 pop.) village? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pantherhr/status/1435695985334833156))
