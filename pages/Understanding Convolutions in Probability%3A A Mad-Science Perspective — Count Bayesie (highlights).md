	- At a high level, in probability, a convolution is the way to determine the distribution of the sum of two random variables. That is, we can see it as a way of combine two probability distributions to create a third distribution, in much the same way we might use multiplication to combine two integers to make a third. This is very useful because, in all but a few special cases, the distribution of the sum of two random variables is not the same as the distribution that each of individual random variable.
