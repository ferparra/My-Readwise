	- What Will the Future of Software Be?
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* The future of software is likely to be more interactive and creative than it is currently, with users able to generate code and software on their own without needing to be experts in programming., * AI is currently getting better at programming tasks than humans, and is likely to become even better in the future. This will allow humans to focus on more creative tasks, rather than having to rely on code generation by computers.)

	  So if you have anything to say about it, what will change over the next 10 to 20 years?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  What could the future of software be?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Maybe harkening back to that distant past where it was much more interactive and creative, I guess is the right word to use, where I've got this powerful thing in my pocket. It does whatever I tell it to do versus me choosing from a menu of stuff that I can do.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  There are multiple answers to this. There's the presence, and then there's the future. And we're seeing glimpses of the future right now. But let me focus on the present first. The sort of white bill today is there's a generation of startups that started in the mid-outs in the past decades that intuited this problems and notion, air table, every kind of no-code tool company. We started with this premise. I mean, if you go look at notions about page, they talk about this problem. And you can extend this to Figma and a lot of these creatives, prosumer tools as well. So that's been really awesome that for the first time this generation of entrepreneurs that want to create software that's fundamentally end user programmable and gives users more freedom. That's one optimistic note. But I don't think it goes far enough. I think you're still fundamentally limited. You need a full programming experience to actually experience the full capacity of computers. You have things like Replit now, where Replit is in a lot of ways when we started the call. You called me a traditionalist because I still live in Silicon Valley. And there's more traditionalist things about me. Another example is I actually think that one of the golden age of computers was when you booted up a computer, and the first thing that you saw was a command line prompt. So the DOS, the Commodore 64 era of computing was a fundamentally programmable user freedom enhancing era of computing. So I think Replit in a lot of ways is going back to the era, which is you open a browser tab and you get this prompt, where it's like you can make any kind of software in the world. The thing is, we're not diluted at Replit. We don't think that everyone in the world will just spend all the time writing software. It is still somewhat of a niche skill. We think a lot more people could learn it. And a lot of people are learning it, and our success at Replit kind of shows that. But it actually thinks that there's another phase shift that is happening now, which is on top of code, we are finally able to layer a natural language interface, which is now you get into generative AI. So GPT-3 knows how to write code better than most people. Deep mind is submitted a paper called alpha code, where they beat something like 50%, or more than 50%. The computer did better than average at programming competitions like LEATH code. And it's getting better really quickly. I think that by next year, AI will be better at these algorithmic interview type questions than any human. So basically, computers are going to get to a point where they're as good as people at generating code. So humans will do what humans do best, which is we're going to be creative with code. We're going to be creative with software. At Replit, we think that we want to make programming more accessible to everyone. We also want to create this layer of AI that allows even the ostensibly non-technical person to be able to generate and create software in the same way that a professional programmer would.
