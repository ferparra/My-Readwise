And just being around a spouse, for example, only surfaces one side of ourselves. Maybe the part of me that likes to garden or do yoga will begin to wither away. If my spouse, for example, doesn't like these activities. But then when I'm around a friend, I can garden and plant my pathos with them. And I'm around another friend that I can downward facing dog with. And I feel my entire identity, according outward, unfold and fan out. And I experience the full richness and complexities of who I am when I have an entire community to bring that out in me. And so that's one of the reasons why friendship is really important.

	  So I can walk through my own experience of making a bunch of friends and share this in a story. I went to Mexico City alone and was there for 10 days and was like okay if I spend 10 days here and don't make any friends I'm going to be very lonely. So how did I make friends when I was there. First I went to a coffee shop, I heard another American there. And I knew you know he's less likely reject me than I think I also knew the research on transitioners right people that are in times of transition are most open to friendship so people that are traveling people that have just moved to the city people that have just started school people that have just retired right. Those are the people to try to connect with versus, you know, someone who's been here for a while and already has an established job work so I knew this guy's a transitioner and he's less likely to reject me than I think.
