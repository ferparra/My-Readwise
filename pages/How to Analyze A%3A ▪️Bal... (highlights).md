	- Every company has 3 financial statements. 
	  
	  Each answers a unique question:
	  
	  1. Balance Sheet: What’s your net worth?
	  
	  2. Income Statement: Are you profitable?
	  
	  3. Cash Flow Statement: Are you generating cash?

	- The financial statements are interrelated.
	  
	  Each views a company’s financials from a different angle.
	  
	  When combined, they provide a more complete view of a company’s true financial position.

	- I’d never make an investment decision without MUCH more analysis than this.
	  
	  Accounting (and investing) is FILLED with nuance
	  
	  Still, with <1 minute of analysis per financial statement, you can quickly identify a company's strengths + weaknesses ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFeroldi/status/1571487935505080326))
	- If you invest, you MUST learn accounting
	  
	  That's why @Brian_Stoffel_ and I created a course that teaches accounting in plain English
