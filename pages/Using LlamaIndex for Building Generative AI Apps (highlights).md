	- a lot of people interms of trying to augment uh data uh isuh trying to augment llms with their own
	  
	  data do some form of in context learningand the idea of in context learning isbasically you have this prompt right andso the question is how do you just stuffthe right context and the prompt uh sothat you can basically uh condition uhthe model on the right side of inputs togive you the output that you want uhjust to give a quick example ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyptk885w1f2m1y6j45w4dww))
		- **Note**: Augmenting data with in-context learning.
	- how do you retrieve theright context for the prompt given thetask uh is your task to ask a simplequestion about a specific detail is itto summarize over some pieces of the
	  
	  documents is it to compare and contrastdocuments is it to go over structureddata the second point is how do you dealwith long context and the third point ishow do you deal with Source data that'svery heterogeneous and potentially verylarge if you have just gigabytes orterabytes of data and the last is youknow the interaction between a retrievalmodel and a language model leads to thiscomplex data system and how do you tradeoff between aspects like performancelatency and costs
	  
	  so that's where uh llama index comes in ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyptq838mebcpdejav160x9f))
		- **Note**: Retrieve right context for given task, deal with long context, heterogeneous data, trade-off performance, latency, costs.
