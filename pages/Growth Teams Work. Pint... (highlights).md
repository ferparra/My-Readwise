	- First, let's start with the purpose of growth experiments.
	  
	  Their purpose is to ask questions, not find wins. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/searchbrat/status/1400455351070191616))
	- 1. Scaling SEO Experiments
	  
	  SEO is a big growth channel for Pinterest. They get 200 million monthly organic visits.
	  
	  They built a framework to help them run SEO experiments.

	- Pinterest ran 100's of SEO experiments, finding the biggest wins in:

	- Pinterest has millions of pages indexed, all of it user-generated.
	  
	  It meant a lot of their page titles were duplicate or poor quality.
	  
	  Pinterest experimented with forming page titles from the best Pins submitted by users.
	  
	  These experiments increased traffic by 30%

	- Pinterest ran experiments to optimize its internal linking.
	  
	  That's hard!
	  
	  You have to track results in both the control and variant groups, but also the changes in different pages each group linked to.
	  
	  Pinterest learned a bunch from these internal link experiments.

	- To optimize your internal links
	- 2. Going international is a critical piece for scaling companies.
	  
	  Pinterest experimented with changing their 'Pin It' button to 'Save'. It was easier to localize.
	  
	  That one experiment increased user activation rates in non-English countries, but also in the U.S.

	- 3. Gating free content
	  
	  Pinterest used to have the option for users to scroll indefinitely.
	  
	  They ran an experiment to add a banner that said
	  
	  "Sign up to see more of this content"
	  
	  That experiment increased their conversion rate by 50%

	- 4. More ways to signup
	  
	  Pinterest experimented with letting users signup via their phone number along with their email.
	  
	  Previously it was just email.
	  
	  Signing up via phone activated at the same rate as email.
	  
	  But, by adding phone, they were able to signup a lot more users.

	- 5. Personalizing User Onboarding
	  
	  Pinterest experimented with lots of onboarding emails
	  
	  They discovered the best emails were teaching people more about the topics they liked, not how the product worked.

	- Pinterest took this insight and applied it to the user's home page, displaying topics of interest to them.
	  
	  But, they noticed the drop-off rates were high for countries outside of the U.S.
	  
	  Pinterest paired the user's interest (topics) with locally relevant information.

	- 6. How Pinterest scaled copy testing
	  
	  Pinterest has millions of users and sends millions of emails.
	  
	  So, there is a lot of opportunity in emails subject lines
	  
	  But how do you test email subject lines at such a scale?
	  
	  Create a framework. CopyTune
