	- The true investor scarcely ever is forced to sell his shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard the current price quotation. He need pay attention to it and act upon it only to the extent that it suits his book, and no more.
	- Although there are good and bad companies, there is no such thing as a good stock; there are only good stock prices, which come and go.
	- Swings govern your financial destiny. In the end, how your investments behave is much less important than how you behave.
	- For most of us, 10% of our overall wealth is the maximum permissible amount to put at speculative risk.
	- I suggest that you rebalance every six months, no more and no less, on easy-to-remember dates like New Year’s and the Fourth of July.
	- If you buy a stock purely because its price has been going up-instead of asking whether the underlying company’s value is increasing-then sooner or later you will be extremely sorry. That’s not a likelihood. It is a certainty.
