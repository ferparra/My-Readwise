	- The Differences Between Slow and Fast Twitch Muscle Fibers
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Force production from muscle fibers is determined mostly by size crosssectional area., * Power is based on velocity, and is markedly different from force.)

	  And just to be clear, the force difference between them, it doesn't matter. It's just velocity or is there a force difference as well?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So a couple of things. In large part, force production from muscle fibers is determined mostly by size cross-sectional area. So getting the fiber bigger is the play to get it faster. Having said that power is markedly different. Because power is based on velocity as well. You times the multiply the force by the velocity. So if you use this metric that we'll use in single fiber experiments, call specific tension, which is sort of like relative strength, you take the size portion out of the equation. What you're going to see is a true slow twitch. So these are also called type one fibers. If you compare those to a type two A, so that's a fast twitch muscle fiber, you're going to see something like five to six X power between these two.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So it's not a small. When you normalize for size, you normalize for cross-sectional diamond.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  If you go to the two X fibers, which is a special class of fast switch fibers, now you're talking 20 X, that power. ([Time 1:12:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4929a4b6-ea6d-49c8-904c-3b7fb972582f))
	- How to Reverse the Process of Muscle Atrophy
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* The most important thing for someone in their 50s to do to maintain their health and function is to focus on the fastdeclining muscle fibers., * To do this, they need to focus on specific types of training that will support the reversal of atrophy.)

	  Speaker 2
	  Just to make sure we translate that and because I think that was so important what you just said, you're basically looking, I'm 50 and you're looking down the barrel of my life saying you want to live another 40 years and you want to be functioning. The most important thing I can do for you in the gym is not focus on the things that you're going to get for free. It's focus on the things that are declining so rapidly. I will as a corollary to that get a bunch of other stuff for free, but I have to focus on the atrophy of your fast switch muscle fibers because it's already happening and we need to save that off and we need to put in the gym systems to support the reversal of that process. Because if I just ignore that, I might as well be that highly exercised twin guy who's doing all his cardio, but at the end of the day, he can't jump off the curb. He's going to be the hyper cardio athlete who's still a decrepit person in the last decade of their life.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  To make it even better or worse, those fibers require specific types of training. Unless you specifically do that, you just don't have any chance of those tissues. The other tissues aren't as like hypertrophy. ([Time 1:56:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/36fbec7d-2bfd-430e-a63b-44bab80928fa))
