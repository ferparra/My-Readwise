	- I built a personal chatbot from my personal corpus[1] a couple weeks ago on fully open-source LMs. On a whim I gave it iMessage.
	  
	  Didn't expect the iMessage bit to matter, but it made a huge difference in how it feels to interact. Much more natural.

	- Full write up hopefully coming soon, but I'm using cosmo-xl for text generation with my own prompt, retrieving from an in memory vector DB with sentence-transformers embeddings, and using @sendbluedotco for iMessage. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thesephist/status/1629272602626732032))

	- @sendbluedotco I love the "Hm..." like it needs a couple tokens of rollout to think before it can compose its response. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thesephist/status/1629281113649586176))
