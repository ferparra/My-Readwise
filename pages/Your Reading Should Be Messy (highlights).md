	- Now hereâ€™s the secret: good reading is messy reading. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwgxhk581cwav78d8013w3ph))
		- **Note**: The author of this text argues that good reading should be messy, advocating for readers to tear, fold, and bend books and not worry about stains or torn edges. This is in direct contrast to what the author was taught as a child, which was that books must be treated as precious things that must be preserved and kept clean. The author discovered that their family only bought books to be displayed like jewelry, and not to be read, which led the author to realize that books should be honored by being broken.
