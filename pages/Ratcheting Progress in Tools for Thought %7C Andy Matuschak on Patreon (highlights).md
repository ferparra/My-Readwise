	- the most powerful tools for thought express deep insights into the underlying subject matter. Creating them involves what we call “insight through making,” in which powerful subject-matter ideas enable new systems, and observations of those systems enable new insights, and so on
	- [Educational design] principles are usually heuristic statements of a format such as: “If you want to design intervention X (for the purpose/function Y in context Z), then you are best advised to give that intervention the characteristics A, B, and C (substantive emphasis), and to do that via procedures K, L, and M (procedural emphasis), because of arguments P, Q, and R [(theoretical emphasis)].”
	- Evan Wallace at Figma developed and documented a new primitive for representing and editing vector paths, motivated by practical problems with existing vector pen tools, which more directly (naively?) expose the underlying Bezier curves.
