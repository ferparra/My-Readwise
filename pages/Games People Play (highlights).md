document_note:: In "Games People Play" by Eric Berne, he provides a framework of understanding why people play games, which he defines as an ongoing series of "complementary ulterior transactions" with a predictable outcome. He describes several types of games which can achieve varying goals, such as validation, reassurance, or revenge. These games generally involve a "White" and a "Black" player, and have various theses and payoffs. He also states that for some people, games are necessary to maintain mental homeostasis. Finally, he suggests avoiding giving unsolicited advice and using "polite correctness" to avoid getting entangled in games.

	- A game is an ongoing series of complementary ulterior transactions progressing to a well-defined, predictable outcome. Descriptively it is a recurring set of transactions, often repetitious, superficially plausible, with a concealed motivation; or, more colloquially, a series of moves with a snare, or ‘gimmick.’” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv05wg014ak3p1ww0wczqh1r))
	- Some facets that encompass games:
	  
	  •   Thesis: The general description of the game. This includes the surface-level details (the social level), and the implicit significance of the exchange (the psychological level).
	    
	  •   Dynamics and aim: The covert psychological motivation and goal of the game, and why people play them (e.g., reassurance).
	    
	  •   Payoffs: The benefits of the game; how it contributes to internal mental stability; how it avoids anxiety-arousing situations; the kind of strokes the game offers to those involved; and the existential point of view the game vindicates (perhaps the most important aspect of the game).
	    
	  •   Antithesis: A refusal to play or undercutting the payoff will cancel the game. Participants in the midst of sequences building up to a game need these sequences to be validated. If faced with adamant refusal to play or a successful undercutting, would-be game players often lapse into despair, frustration, and bewilderment. They may try to guilt you into continuing the game, or con you into playing another game in their quest for an emotional payoff. Sometimes game players achieve self-awareness, and when faced with someone who won’t play, will respond with laughter (“There I go again!”).

	- > *“It should be remembered that the essential feature of a game is its culmination, or payoff. The principal function of the preliminary moves is to set up the situation for this payoff, but they are always designed to harvest the maximum permissible satisfaction at each step as a secondary product.”*
	  
	  In other words, the game has an ultimate payoff people seek, but they also find satisfaction in each step leading up to the payoff. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv05zbms1k8a9erkaw403bvf))
	- The psychologist Dan P. McAdams has written:
	  
	  > *“Americans revel in their victimhood… Many Americans reconstruct the past in especially negative ways to set up a recovery narrative for themselves...Comfortably sipping wine in their spacious suburban homes, upper-middle-class Americans need something to overcome…assert competing claims of victimhood, vying for attention and support.”* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv06173p72adn57ab7db4agn))
