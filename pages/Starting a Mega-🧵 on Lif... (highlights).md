	- Starting a mega-ðŸ§µ on life alpha. 
	  
	  Insights that appear when my [[subconscious]] is lit up (eg shower thoughts, traveling) will be added periodically as they manifest.
	  
	  My goal is to collect the ingredients for making great life decisions, & you are welcome to join for the ride ðŸš€ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gametheorizing/status/1459679046254706688))

	- Decision making is the meta-skill that rules them all.
	  
	  We have limited time in life, so enormous success can only come from having superior judgement, not from working harder. 
	  
	  Even with superb routines and efficiency, you cant outwork 100 ppl. They have 2400 hours to your 24. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gametheorizing/status/1459679048045670404))
	- But in a single decision point, one person can still beat a million. 
	  
	  If you compete in a dynamic where each side can only make one move at a time, you can get some real Spartan 300 type shit.
	  
	  One famous example was Kasparov's match against a forum of 50,000 players in 1999.

	- Good decisions also stack up and compound. 
	  
	  By consistently picking the +ev side of a series of 51%/49% bets you can quickly get stratospheric returns using Kelly Criterion for sizing.
	  
	  This can scale up until the market has liquidity to take your bet size, which is plenty. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gametheorizing/status/1459679055549186054))
	- Enough intro, lets start stacking.
	  
	  #1. The best in the world are on a different stratosphere than the rest. 
	  
	  Even if you are an amazing 2Ïƒ 3-point shooter, the z-score difference between you and your -2Ïƒ grandma is smaller than you and +7Ïƒ Steph Curry!
	  
	  This has implications:

	- -There is a "2Ïƒ trap" : being better than almost anyone you know in IRL and letting your ego's identity get tied to this. Losing humbleness will stop your growth there.
	  
	  -Insights from the world's best are immensely valuable. Level up enough first so you can appreciate them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gametheorizing/status/1459679061471596549))
	- -Uniquely skilled people across all disciplines seek each other out. The top actors, athletes, businessmen, etc are just 1-degree of seperation apart from each other.
	  
	  If one can level up enough to get access to the elite group, growth goes parabolic. It truly is a binary thing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gametheorizing/status/1459679063229059073))
