	- Repeat after me:
	  
	  Colocating behavioural logic TOGETHER is good.
	  
	  Colocating behavioural logic WHERE IT'S USED is bad. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1406985604898897928))
	- Side effects in XState:
	  
	  Actions: a point in time
	  Services: the length of time of one state
	  Spawned actors: any length of time ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1424062262403379207))
	- Using state machines allow you to be Steve-level of thoughtful about subtle interactions in your app.
	  
	  If you knew you'd end up writing this in a spaghetti of useEffects, you'd be incentivised to simplify the feature to get it done. State machines let you think bigger. https://t.co/XKCtlG0j1J ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1426945980432277512))
	- Brainwave: a UI design is a state machine.
	  
	  You input a finite state (homepage, view profile page, etc), and it outputs a UI. It's a pure function.
	  
	  And the main complaint about design -> developer handoff? Implicit states.
	  
	  ðŸ’¡ FSM's are the ultimate design handoff solution... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1435287400566116361))
	- Task estimation is broken. Ephemeral assets kill iteration. Implicit states need to be made explicit.
	  
	  Develop with statecharts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1449043916095901698))
	- Brewing an idea for a blogpost on Statechart Driven Development.
	  
	  The problem:
	  
	  1. Task estimation is broken
	  2. User stories are brittle and hard to change
	  3. Discovery/refinement of implicit states must be a first-class part of any project ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1449040697932255238))

	- ðŸ”¥ TypeScript Tip ðŸ”¥
	  
	  Object.keys is DELIBERATELY not very type-safe. This can feel extremely annoying to beginners.
	  
	  But it's for a good reason... https://t.co/CGYUGiHZSK ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk/status/1596167864553459715))
