	- Repeat after me:
	  
	  Colocating behavioural logic TOGETHER is good.
	  
	  Colocating behavioural logic WHERE IT'S USED is bad. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1406985604898897928))
	- Side effects in XState:
	  
	  Actions: a point in time
	  Services: the length of time of one state
	  Spawned actors: any length of time ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1424062262403379207))
	- Using state machines allow you to be Steve-level of thoughtful about subtle interactions in your app.
	  
	  If you knew you'd end up writing this in a spaghetti of useEffects, you'd be incentivised to simplify the feature to get it done. State machines let you think bigger. https://t.co/XKCtlG0j1J ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1426945980432277512))
	- Brainwave: a UI design is a state machine.
	  
	  You input a finite state (homepage, view profile page, etc), and it outputs a UI. It's a pure function.
	  
	  And the main complaint about design -> developer handoff? Implicit states.
	  
	  ðŸ’¡ FSM's are the ultimate design handoff solution... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1435287400566116361))
	- Task estimation is broken. Ephemeral assets kill iteration. Implicit states need to be made explicit.
	  
	  Develop with statecharts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1449043916095901698))
	- Brewing an idea for a blogpost on Statechart Driven Development.
	  
	  The problem:
	  
	  1. Task estimation is broken
	  2. User stories are brittle and hard to change
	  3. Discovery/refinement of implicit states must be a first-class part of any project ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1449040697932255238))

	- ðŸ”¥ TypeScript Tip ðŸ”¥
	  
	  Object.keys is DELIBERATELY not very type-safe. This can feel extremely annoying to beginners.
	  
	  But it's for a good reason... https://t.co/CGYUGiHZSK ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk/status/1596167864553459715))

	- Best open-source TypeScript apps... GO
	  
	  For instance, https://t.co/9lORJTxIeM and https://t.co/C778Tt9sM3 both have open source repos. SO much to learn from those codebases. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk/status/1598372605781635072))

	- ðŸ”¥ TypeScript Tip ðŸ”¥
	  
	  Checking out TS codebases like @excalidraw's has been so enlightening - especially how many of them are using 'as const' over enums. https://t.co/zIuvuNPWyJ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk/status/1598708710523772929))

	- Conditional types in TypeScript are just like if/else statements.
	  
	  There's a check, a true case, and a false case. https://t.co/QQJZJtowj3 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk/status/1606055010319470595))

	- Had another idea for a zod library - this one to do with type-safe messaging between different environments.
	  
	  Perfect for websockets, window.postMessage, or any kind of pub/sub.
	  
	  But I need some help naming the primitives. Assist me! https://t.co/IYi1s2lwvx ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk/status/1622720203762065412))
