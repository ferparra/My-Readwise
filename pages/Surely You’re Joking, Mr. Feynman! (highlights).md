document_note:: Richard Feynman's life is recounted from his own perspective, detailing his work on the Manhattan Project in 1943, his obsession with radios as a young kid, his amazing curiosity and problem-solving skills, and his interest in art. Feynman puts himself in uncomfortable situations to learn something new and is able to observe and control his dreams. He is a logical thinker who despises arrogance and won the Nobel Prize, but despises the hassle that comes with it. He is an incredibly curious person who enjoys solving things and being with other people, and is an example of someone who pursues their curiosity and desire to learn.
