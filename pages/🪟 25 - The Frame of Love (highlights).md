	- Schopenhauer concludes his wailing with this sort of antidote, as he writes in his essay *On the Suffering of the World:* ‚ÄúThe correct standard for¬†*judging any man*¬†is to remember that he is really a being ‚Ä¶ who is atoning for his existence through many different forms of suffering and through death. What can we expect from such a being? We atone for our birth first by living and secondly by dying‚Ä¶ In fact from this point of view, it might occur to us that the really proper address between one man and another should be, instead of¬†*Sir, Monsieur*¬†and so on,¬†*Leidensgefahrte, socci molorum, compagnon de mis√®res,¬†my fellow sufferer.*¬†However strange this may sound, it accords with the facts, puts the other man in the most correct light, and reminds us of the most necessary thing, tolerance, patience, forbearance, and love of one‚Äôs neighbour, which everyone needs and each of us, therefore, owes to another.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmy3kdjh2sy2zq729kw3djzv))
