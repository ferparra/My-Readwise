	- CRV LPs are @stablekwon's exit liquidity

	- TFL owns 413mm $LUNA tokens worth $43.3bn today
	  
	  That's larger than the curreny circulating token supply
	  
	  Exiting this stake without disruption is a bit like walking on egg shells

	- Over the last 6 months TFL has begun to unwind its stake 
	  
	  First by donating LUNA to LFG 
	  
	  Then through OTC sales at large discounts
	  
	  Now Do wants to build a BTC war chest

	- LUNA currently holds $1.5bn of BTC
	  
	  It plans to build to $10bn of mkt value
	  
	  Where will it get $8.5bn from? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1512095861475532804))
	- One way would be to sell LUNA for dollars and then buy BTC
	  
	  But that would 
	  -Create supply overhang
	  -Increase circulating supply of LUNA
	  -Send the wrong signal about TFLs view of value ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1512095862960365578))
	- Instead Do Kwon will burn its LUNA for UST
	  
	  It will then use UST to source BTC
	  
	  The problem is there is nowhere near enough BTC on Terra native exchanges
	  
	  Astroport is $1.6bn of TVL and doesn't even have a BTC cross ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1512095864487088138))
	- Itâ€™s increasingly obvious that Do will
	  
	  -Burn LUNA to mint UST
	  -Bridge UST to Ethereum
	  -Swap UST for USDC/T on CRV
	  -Use USDC/T to buy BTC ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1512095865934131210))
	- We've seen this already play out
	- The problem is that the current CRV pools are not large enough
	  
	  There is $650mm of USDC/T in the UST wormhole CRV pools 
	  
	  He needs $8.5bn

	- Thatâ€™s why the 4pool announcement is not surprising
	  
	  Do needs large continuous access to hard currency
	  
	  He can only get this on CRV
	  
	  This works is if there are LPs that provide USDC/T for UST
	  
	  If not --- Do will likely face pool imbalance issues and need to sell LUNA for dollars ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1512095870229127176))
	- There is some evidence that TFL look advantage of the MIM UST pool
	  
	  MIM/UST peaked at ~$1bn and shrunk to $100mm
	  
	  The dune dashboard below suggests TFL accelerated the MIM issues
	  
	  Would love to hear ppls view on this

	- LUNA needs a deep, growing hard currency pool
	  
	  Bribes on CRV/CVX will grow as a result
	  
	  LUNA bribe payments are analgous to the discount needed to place billions of LUNA on an OTC basis ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1512095873274105861))
	- Since private token placements have a common 20-30% discount
	  
	  We can say that if Do is able to exit $8.5bn of LUNA by only paying 15% in bribes --- this is accretive ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xHamz/status/1512095874658222087))
