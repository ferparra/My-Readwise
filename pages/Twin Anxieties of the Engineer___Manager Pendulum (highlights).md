document_note:: The article discusses anxieties related to career transitions between engineering and management roles. Many engineers who have enjoyed their role as a manager worry that they may not get another chance to manage and feel bittersweet when they choose to return to engineering. However, experienced managers are in high demand and more likely to be tapped for management roles again. The second anxiety is related to productivity concerns and whether engineers, after having technical skills erode or decay with time, would still be considered valuable contributors or be hired for engineering roles. The author encourages individuals to maintain fluency in their technical skills as this can help in maintaining longer-term job options and security.
