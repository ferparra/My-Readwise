	- Get a cup of filter coffee.
	  
	  In this thread, we are going to talk about HR Tech.
	  
	  A $25B+ category of software tools growing at 15% YoY.
	  
	  With giants like ADP clocking in more than $10B in Revenue. 
	  
	  It's time we talk about this.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- This is the structure I'll try to follow with this thread:
	  
	  1/ Why should you (as an investor/ founder) care?
	  
	  2/ What is HR Tech?
	  
	  3/ Where is the money?
	  
	  4/ Trends I am excited about
	  
	  So let's dive into it!
	  
	  2/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/manavbs/status/1483794087664754692))
	- First. 
	  
	  Why should you care? 
	  
	  Well, that is a great question.
	  
	  The short and simple answer: $25B Market that saw over $6B of capital invested in the last calendar year alone.
	  
	  But I want people to read this thread. 
	  
	  So here are a few pointers:
	  
	  3/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/manavbs/status/1483794088801406977))
	- 1/ The Great Resignation 
	  
	  The world as we know is changing.
	  
	  A record-high number of folks are quitting. 
	  
	  The HR Function is more critical than ever.
	  
	  Recruitment as a whole is more critical than ever.

	- 2/ Remote or Hybrid Work - The New Normal.
	  
	  Now, this is self-explanatory. 
	  
	  People love working from the beaches/ mountains/ couches.
	  
	  We need tools to make sure that continues.

	- 3/ HR Function hasn't evolved.
	  
	  Tools currently being used at scale have existed for decades. Literally. 
	  
	  ADP is 73 years old. 73. 
	  
	  Paychex is 50 years old. 50.
	  
	  These tools are ripe for disruption.

	- 4/ HR Function is inefficient.
	  
	  I studied 25 fastest-growing SaaS companies in the world. HR teams end up having to scale 15% faster to keep up with the growing needs of the organization.
	  
	  We can get tools to make this better.

	- I am sure you are now equally passionate about the present & future of HR Tech as I am; if not, read the four tweets again.
	  
	  No, I am serious; read them again.
	  
	  Only if you're convinced, carry on.

	- Next, what comprises HR Tech.
	  
	  Now, like most things in life, there is no one definition â€“but this is how I split the category in my head.
	  
	  Maybe it'll help you as well.

	- 1. Core HR
	  
	  This includes HRIS & Payroll.
	  
	  Companies cannot function without this. 
	  
	  HRIS: HR information System - the easiest way to think about this is CRM for employees.
	  
	  Payroll: The name on the top of your payslip
	  
	  Top companies: Workday, ADP, Successfactors, Paychex 
	  
	  10/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/manavbs/status/1483794120053194752))
	- 2. Talent Acquisition/ Assessment 
	  
	  This includes your ATS, Interviewing tools, assessment tools, etc.
	  
	  This stack is one that needs major upheaval.
	  
	  Top companies: Lever, Freshteam, Greenhouse, Plum, etc.
	  
	  And of course @recruitwithkula.

	- 3. Employee Engagement
	  
	  This includes all the tools your HR uses to keep you as an employee happy & engaged.
	  
	  All culture, communication, & performance management tools fall in this category.
	  
	  Top companies: Humu, CultureAmp, Lattice, Staffbase, etc.
	  
	  12/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/manavbs/status/1483794122276147211))
	- 4. HR Strategy
	  
	  Now, this is a relatively new category.
	  
	  The closest equivalent would be the FP&A tools in the CFO Stack. 
	  
	  Systemic appraisal, headcount planning, etc.
	  
	  Basically enabling HRs to be more reactive than proactive.
	  
	  Top companies: Charthop, Pyn, Pave, etc
	  
	  13/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/manavbs/status/1483794123391856640))
	- That's it. That's the stack.
	  
	  This covers 95% of all tools that an HR will ever use.
	  
	  14/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/manavbs/status/1483794124926898178))
	- Also, to answer where is the money.
	  
	  All of it, okay 90% of it is in the "Core HR" stack.
	  
	  The other 4 sections continue to grow fast, but all the money is with the big 4 of HR Tech.
	  
	  *SWAP*
	  
	  Successfactors
	  Workday
	  ADP
	  Paychex
	  
	  15/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/manavbs/status/1483794125958705156))
	- And finally, trends that I am excited about. 
	  
	  1/ Disrupting the giants in Core HR
	  
	  2/ HR Strategy - enabling the Chief People Officer
	  
	  3/ Recruitment Automation 
	  
	  4/ Remote Work/ Hybrid Work Enablers
	  
	  16/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/manavbs/status/1483794127481278465))
	- As you can clearly see. I love HR Tech.

	- Thank you very much for reading all the way to the end.
	  
	  If you did enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. 
	  
	  Do give it a Retweet & a like. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/manavbs/status/1483794129725255680))
	- Additionally, I'll be doing a sector teardown like this every Wednesday. 
	  
	  (History says this won't be true for too long)
	  
	  Either way, do consider following, at least some number will go up (unlike my Metamask wallet)
