	- Signal to Noise and Environment
	  
	  Summary:
	  "The human ability to get assimilated, no, get used to violence is incredible," he says. "In a matter of days, sometimes hours, it becomes the normal." In Harkiv, many people say they're safe and that their farms are still running. But in fact, as CNN's John Sutter finds out, most aren't so sure.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  I should mention people know this throughout human history, but the human ability to get assimilated, no, get used to violence is incredible. So like you could be living in a peaceful time, like we're here now, and there would be one explosion, like a 9-11 type of situation. That'd be a huge shock, terrifying, everybody freaks out. The second one is a huge drop off in how you freaked out you get. And with, in a matter of days, sometimes hours, it becomes the normal. I've talked to so many people in Harkiv, which is one of the towns that's seen a lot of heated battle. You ask them, is it safe there? In fact, when I went to the close and closer to the war zone, you ask people, is it safe? And there are answers usually, yeah, it's pretty safe.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  It's all signal to noise.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  It like nobody has told me, except like Western reporters sitting in the West side of Ukraine, it's really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, it's good. My uncle just died yesterday. He was shot. But it's pretty good. Like the farm's still running. How do I put it? They focus on the positive, that's one. But there's a deeper truth, though, which is you just get used to difficult situations. And the stuff that make you happy and the stuff that make you upset is relative to that new normal that you establish.

	- Language and the Perception of Reality
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Speaker 1 prefers the basement over the attic because it is cold down there., * Speaker 1 tries to be positive and see the positive perspective in life and when he is serious, try to be positive as well., * People can attack each other over the use of words, even if the words are not malicious.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  It's the attic? I keep minding the basement. That's the details. I was referring to your attic. I don't have an attic or a basement. Oh. No, no, no dead bodies. I just want to be very clear.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah. I do have an attic and actually haven't been up to maybe there's bodies up there. But yes, I prefer the basement. It's cold down there. I like it. No, but there's an assumption that this is not genuine or not. It's disingenuous in some kind of way. And so I try to find the right language for that kind of stuff how to be positive. Some of it, I was really inspired by Elon's approach to Twitter. Not all of it. But the, when he just is silly, I found that silliness, I think it's Herman Hesse said something to paraphrase. One of my favorite writers. I think in step of of said, learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest. I think I try to be silly, laugh at myself, laugh at the absurdity of life. And then in part, when I'm serious, try to just be positive. Just see a positive perspective. But and also, as you said, people pick out certain words and so on and they attack each other, attack me over certain usage of words.

	- The Different Types of Relationships
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* A job is not a calling., * If you focus on a career, you may be able to make an income and be happy with it, but you may not be fulfilled., * If you focus on a calling, you may be able to make a lot of money, but you may also be able to find happiness and fulfillment in your work.)

	  Speaker 2
	  Nor am I agreeing with it. It's just everyone's in a while. There's a, there's a Lex Friedman ism that, that hits a particular circuit in my brain. I just have to just laugh out loud.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I just think that it's easy to have a relationship when everything is good. The relationships that become strong and are tested quickly are the ones when, when shit is going down.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Well, then there's hope for me yet. So, you know, before we sat down, I was having a conversation with a podcast producer who is a, I wouldn't say avid, rather he's a rabid consumer of podcasts and finds these amazing podcasts, that he's a small podcast and, you know, and, and unique episodes. Anyway, we were talking about some stuff that he had seen and read in the business sector. And he was talking about the difference between, you know, job, career and a calling, right? And I, and I think he was extracting this from conversations of, of CEOs and founders, etc. I forget the specific founders that, that brought this to light for him. But, you know, that this idea that if you focus on a job, you know, you can make an income and hopefully you enjoy your job or not hate it too much.
