	- Focusing on bad metrics, especially vanity metrics, often leads to bad decisions.
	  
	  We've experienced it with @ScrapingBee and decided to fix this.
	  
	  We asked ourselves if all the things we measure made sense and what should be changed.
	  
	  Here is what happened

	- Bad Metric 1️⃣: Focus on the total number of visitors on all our websites (blog + landing).
	  
	  Bad Decision 1️⃣: We write content the would appeal to the broadest audience possible, in order to gather as many people on our website as possible.

	- our business is not to have readers, it is to have customers
	- Good Decision 1️⃣:
	- This was wrong because most of our support ended being spent on customers representing less than 10% of our revenue.
	  
	  We now don't really care about the number of customers. 
	  
	  New metric 2️⃣: MRR and ARPA.
	  
	  New decision 2️⃣: We ditched the $9 plan.

	- Focusing on these two metrics also simplifies our decision-making process.
	  
	  All things being equal, if we want to improve metric 1️⃣, we work on content and SEO, if want to improve 2️⃣, we work on conversion.
	  
	  We will share our results on our next #openreport.
