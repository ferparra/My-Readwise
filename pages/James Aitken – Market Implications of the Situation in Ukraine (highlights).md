	  And i'm stowned to think that as important as that inflation conversation has been, i'm not sure that matters any more, or at least not to the extent we thought it might three weeks ago, because this is now exclusively about du politics. But of course, we will talk about markets, but think about regret and think about the psychology of vesting. And i notice this a bit high faluti, but i do think it's useful to help us set the scene. A so called maxi max strategy involves selecting the alternative that maximizes the maximum pay off available. And in practical sense, a recent example of that would be those investors who went long everything in march and april 20 20, expecting a colossal sustained policy response. So the maximax strategy is suitable for an optimistic, risk seeking investor who desires to maximize their returns from the best possible outcome, a minimax regret strategy is one in which the investor seeks to minimize their maximum regret. How i minimize the damage from the worst case outcome? And it's the opportunity loss through having made the wrong decision. That's what regret is.
