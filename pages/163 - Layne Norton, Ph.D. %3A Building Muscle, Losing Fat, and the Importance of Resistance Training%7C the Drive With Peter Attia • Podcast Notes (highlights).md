- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- “Resistance training is the most powerful tool to change body composition and arguably overall health too.” – Layne Norton
	- As you approach lower levels of body fat, spend more time in maintenance than deficit
	- Metabolism is not an on/off switch: you are always burning and storing fat simultaneously – and – synthesizing and degrading protein at the same time
	- The most powerful predictor of longevity past age 65 is how much lean body mass you have
	- Consistency in exercise and nutrition partly requires forming a new identity: instead of “I run” – think, “I am a runner”
	- You don’t have to be motivated to exercise or eat well – make it part of what you do and who you are to maintain consistency
	- Ask yourself how you can get better, not how you can be like someone else
	- Very broadly: resistance training triggers a cascade of DNA response to a stressor and brings amino acids in to build new proteins
	- Around 7 out of every 8 amino acids are recycled from degraded proteins
	- Muscle tissue is about 70% water and 30% protein
	- Purified solutions of leucine increase mTor activity and muscle protein synthesis
	- Whey protein increases and peaks muscle protein synthesis at 90-minutes post-meal then goes back down to by baseline by 3 hrs
	- In mixed muscle protein synthesis: the peak is about the same for untrained versus untrained but the duration of peak lasts longer in untrained
	- In myofibrillar (contractile) muscle protein synthesis: don’t know how long it lasts for trained or untrained
