	- Quick investment ðŸ§µ
	  
	  Probably one of the best investing 'abilities' is to recognize trends ahead of time, find talent, etc etc. Like, if you knew BTC or ETH or punks were gonna blow up, awesome. You made $$$. But that's really, really hard. I also think there's a second ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cyounessi1/status/1430275250453979140))

	- equally valuable and maybe (?) not often talked about facet of investing, and that's the notion of "feeling like you've missed the boat when you really, really haven't."
	  
	  When I first found btc in 2015 I thought I was too late and barely invested. It had rallied 1,000x already! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cyounessi1/status/1430275251607310338))
	- When I found eth in 2016 I thought I was too late and barely invested (it was up 400x already!). When I found YFI I thought...maybe I'm not so late? Even though the price had already gone up 10x. Did a *tiny* bit more size. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cyounessi1/status/1430275252928532483))
	- When I found punks *only this year* everything was already up ~100-1000x. But I've been training myself to think "hey maybe I'm still early." Maybe, if I'm spending 24/7 consuming in this space, it's actually unlikely that I'm "late" to recent popular trends. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cyounessi1/status/1430275254035918849))
	- Just because some absolute chad genius found it years before me and has an extra 100x under his belt doesn't mean there isn't huge upside left for the rest of us. I still didn't go mega hard, but again a tiny bit more. It's a slow process that I'm training myself for. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cyounessi1/status/1430275255260569600))
	- My point is, I don't feel like I have to jump on every hot trend from the start, or discover things purely on my own. Sometimes just being around and keeping your eyes open can be enough. To that end, I aped into a bunch of degenerative art lately. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cyounessi1/status/1430275256355262475))
	- It feels bubbly, it feels toppy, I don't understand all of it. But it's clearly extremely popular. And I'm just not convinced that I'm late to this game. I don't care that I'm lifting highs. If this takes off, in a few years I'll look back and realize I was actually pretty early. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cyounessi1/status/1430275257563336704))
