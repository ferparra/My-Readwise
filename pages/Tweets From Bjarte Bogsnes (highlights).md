	- Control is expensive. Trust is free. Do the math. Deal firmly with those abusing it, but don’t punish everybody because somebody did something wrong. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbogsnes/status/1402711851302100996))
	- I am tired of companies presenting way too glossy and sanitized transformation journey stories. Change is never structured and orderly. It is not complicated, but complex, and often chaotic. Only for real when it feels messy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbogsnes/status/1423754230695972867))

	- Cost budgeting is about pre-allocation of resources. The more we pre-allocate, the more need to re-allocate when things change (as they always do). [[Beyond Budgeting]] recommends a dynamic resource allocation, just like Agile recommends a continous delivery of software functionality ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbogsnes/status/1278054059207991297))
