document_note:: Self-organized criticality is a new way of viewing nature, where anything can happen within well-defined statistical laws, and is used to explain why nature is complex, not simple. It is manifested in regular catastrophic events, fractals, 1/f noise, and Zipf's Laws, and is an underlying principle of self-organization, where no outside agent is necessary for complex behavior to arise. Chaos is not complexity, and complexity is a consequence of criticality. Earthquakes are the cleanest example of SOC in nature, and economics shows many signs of being critical, but its attempt to be scientific has made it largely unpredictable. Traffic jams are also at a critical state. SOC is a law of nature and the most efficient dynamic state.

	- **Complex systems** - systems with large variability
	  
	  1.  Brain may be the most complex system of all as it is able to model the complex outer world
	  2.  Biggest puzzle of all may be how does complexity arise out of simple laws
	  3.  Because of the large sensitivity of the critical state, small perturbations will eventually affect the behavior everywhere (butterfly/Lorenz effect)
	  4.  **Complexity is a consequence of criticality**
	  5.  Complexity deals with common phenomena in different sciences so the study of complexity benefits from an interdisciplinary approach ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1rn3yqe28ebrmrbf337xr))
		- **Note**: This document explores the concept of complexity in systems, and how it arises from simple laws. It is suggested that complexity is a consequence of the critical state of the system, meaning that small perturbations can affect the behavior everywhere. This concept is demonstrated by the butterfly/Lorenz effect, and the concept of complexity is applicable to many sciences and thus requires an interdisciplinary approach. Brain function is stated to be the most complex system of all as it is able to model the complex outer world.
	- **SOC systems evolve to the complex critical state without interference from any outside agent, an external organizing force.** **Criticality, and therefore complexity, can and will emerge "for free" without any watchmaker tuning the world** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1s42qefy0cbstcqqw2hrv))
	- **Perhaps our ultimate understanding of scientific topics is measured in terms of our ability to generate metaphoric pictures of what is going on. Maybe understanding is coming up with metaphoric pictures**
	  
	  1.  All thinking is a type of analogy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1vw16bfh4573e248qtkjy))
	- Nothing prevents further progress more than the belief that everything is already understood ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1sjzk2j8yjy6ba5efe6fy))
	- Acquiring insight is itself a worthwhile effort ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1sr8evrx47mq8sj7nbx4w))
	- **Insight seldom arises from complicated messy modeling, but more often from gross oversimplification.** Once the essential mechanism has been identified, it is easy to check for robustness by tagging on more and more details ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1sweyxs7g9krcmmekas1x))
		- **Note**: Insight often begins with thinking of something in a very simple way. Once the most important idea has been discovered, it can be made stronger by adding extra details.
	- **SOC is a law of nature for which there is no dispensation - cannot suppress the fluctuations forever**
	  
	  1.  **Critical state is the most efficient state that can happen dynamically**
	    1.  **Why does it occur all over nature? Because it is robust and efficient!!**
	    2.  **Fluctuations are not perfect but they are healthy for dynamic systems. An over-engineered system may be more efficient for some time but catastrophically unstable** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1tqzx2m5x5vzfqgfxy7ye))
		- **Note**: Self-organized criticality is a law in nature that means things can't stay the same forever. The most efficient way for something to happen is when it is in a critical state. That's why this happens all around us. Even though things don't always go as planned, it's good for things to move and change. If a system is too perfect, it might work well for a little while, but then it will break down.
