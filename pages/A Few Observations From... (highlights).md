	- A few observations from this piece from @danshipper about why he isn't using @RoamResearch anymore:
	  
	  1. If all links are intentional, then reviewing them is less likely to surprise you
	  
	  2. Many people review notes so infrequently as to make upfront structuring effort not worth it

	- 3. It is valuable to remove the friction of "where do I put this?" as that can get in the way of writing the note (people like @EleanorKonik who have a well architected system and a sense of "mise en place" are the exception) https://t.co/muQ07Qelr6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1492656303478489091))
	- 4. Strong search can remove the friction of placement. Roam's design seems to want users to create new pages for terms & filter through unlinked references to find info instead of a more traditional search. This is good for exploratory search, inefficient for focused search.

	- 5. If people rarely *intentionally* review notes, upfront structure is not worth it. Additionally, it's difficult to predict what you will use that structure for in the future. Ideally, your PKM should be able to generate structure in hindsight from as little info as possible

	- 6. The best tools for thought of the future will work like a programming language that makes it trivial to refactor information in hindsight (since you can't predict all possible ways you will use it) with "AI" that writes "code" for you. https://t.co/LU99LkYU6I

	- With everything I write into my notes, there's no reason it can't resurface likely relevant material while I'm writing about it. @wandcrafting and I wrote about this in part 2 of roamgames, but the conceptual framework could be applied to many data models. https://t.co/wezshrwwaW ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1492686555659440132))

	- I put "AI" into quotes because it doesn't have to be machine learning. It could look at the structure you already have and surface relevant material. If your thought processor has relationships, it can surface surprising information.
