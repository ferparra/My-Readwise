	- Meditation is physically uncomfortable. This is a feature as well as a bug for [spoilers] reasons, but we shouldn't make it unnecessarily hard on ourselves. Here's what I still use after years of trying all sorts of different sitting set ups. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeoStevens76/status/1551046491631861762))

	- This hexagonal sitting pad is the most comfortable I've tried. Can be used on its own or on top of a meditation cushion. Doubles as a good head pad for lying in savasana.

	- This stretchy meditation belt comes with stupid instructions but is otherwise excellent when used properly (wrapped around knees, not ankles, and slung low on the hips, not around the lumbar spine). Significantly reduces lower back fatigue

	- Any sleep mask that is comfortable removes the temptation to open your eyes, and this has a surprising effect on calming down certain restlessness patterns.

	- Foam rolling the mid back before a sit really helps release tension in my experience. I use a water bottle wrapped in cloth tape, but a softer foam might be better if you're not used to foam rolling.

	- Romanian deadlifts and facepulls are exercises that help strengthen postural muscles and counteract the effects of sitting at a computer all day. You can do facepulls with exercise bands, they come with a door anchor. I just leave them set up on a closet.
