	- The Double Diamond framework consists of the 4D's:
	  
	  1. Discover

	  3. Develop
	  4. Deliver  
	  
	  Let's start with "Discover" ðŸ‘‡

	- 1/ Discover: Insight into the problem
	  
	  *Identify and contextualize the actual problems or opportunities.*
	  
	  Common activities in this phase include market research, user testing, and empathy interviews
	  
	  Ensure you are focused on the customers:
	  
	  1. Wants
	  2. Needs
	  3. Behavior ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1582039021240320002))
	- 2/ Define: The area to focus on
	  
	  During the Discover phase, you'll identify many opportunities.  
	  
	  In the Define phase, we want to zero in on a *singular problem statement* to go after.
	  
	  Ensure you incorporate a prioritization process based on the size of the opportunity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1582039023392014338))
	- 3/ Develop: Potential solutions
	  
	  This is a fun phase for the entire team.  
	  
	  The team brainstorms *possible solutions* to meet the identified problem statement.
	  
	  Engineers are critical in this phase to ensure the LOE to deliver potential solutions is properly assessed. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1582039025464086529))
	- 4/ Deliver: Solutions that work
	  
	  In this final phase, the team determines the final prototype to be developed.  
	  
	  A common strategy is through re-assessing discovery work and voting on mockups.
	  
	  Remember an MVP approach should be considered to take a test and learn approach. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PatThePM/status/1582039027812892673))
	- 5/ Summary
	  
	  While there are a variety of frameworks to facilitate discovery work, the Double Diamond is a favorite of top product teams.
	  
	  It's a great way to build buy-in and camaraderie within your team.
	  
	  Remember the 4D's:
	  
	  1. Discover
	  2. Define
	  3. Develop
