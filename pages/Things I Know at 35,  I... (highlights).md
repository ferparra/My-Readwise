	- Caring what other people think takes up WAY more mental space for you than them. 
	  
	  We over-index on this when, in reality, people are so consumed with their own stuff. 
	  
	  Stop worrying what people will think. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AmandaMGoetz/status/1420012741021077515))
	- Self talk matters. 
	  
	  The way I speak to myself now is truly more loving and kind. 
	  
	  Want to take a break? You deserve it! 
	  
	  Skipped a workout? You must be tired! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AmandaMGoetz/status/1420012742669447174))
	- Stop seeking empathy & sympathy from people who will never give it. 
	  
	  My parents lived a way harder life and view mine as a cake walk. Trying to get them to show any form of empathy is not productive. 
	  
	  Therapy met this need. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AmandaMGoetz/status/1420012744003178502))
	- Being alone does not equal being lonely. 
	  
	  I‚Äôve learned to truly love being alone thanks to the pandemic. 
	  
	  I think many toxic relationships in my twenties would have ended sooner if I had less fear of being alone / lonely. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AmandaMGoetz/status/1420012745471275013))
	- Boundaries will look and feel like selfishness. 
	  
	  Saying no to convos that drain you, extra work that isn‚Äôt meaningful, relationship dynamics that trigger you‚Ä¶..all will look like you are putting your needs before anyone else‚Äôs. 
	  
	  And you are. 
	  And that‚Äôs ok. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AmandaMGoetz/status/1420012748109492238))
	- Therapy works. 
	  
	  That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the tweet. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AmandaMGoetz/status/1420012749535461379))
	- Staying in ANY relationship (friend, romantic, work) because you‚Äôve already put X amount of work/time/effort into it is not the right frame. 
	  
	  Sunk costs. 
	  
	  Why waste another minute not seeking a more fulfilling relationship? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AmandaMGoetz/status/1420012750793752578))
	- Look down for gratitude. 
	  Look around for support. 
	  Look up for inspiration. 
	  
	  I used to ALWAYS compare myself to those ahead of me in life and I lost all sense of gratitude for where I was and how fortunate I was. 
	  
	  Where you focus your attention will affect your framing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AmandaMGoetz/status/1420012751980834825))
	- Reframe your power. 
	  
	  Rather than being angry no one is supporting / helping you‚Ä¶..be proud you can do it on your own. 
	  
	  Wanting something is different than needing something. 
	  
	  This was a HUGE shift for me and pride quickly replaced anger. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AmandaMGoetz/status/1420012753272688645))
	- There is plank walk at 30. 
	  
	  I viewed my 20s as a race to get it all figured out / in place before 30. Society does this to us. 
	  
	  I‚Äôm 35 & single. 
	  I started a company. 
	  I‚Äôm in the best shape of my life. 
	  
	  Life doesn‚Äôt end when conventional media says it does. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AmandaMGoetz/status/1420012754644185088))
	- Make sure your life OKRs are measuring the right things.  
	  
	  Personal Example: 
	  ‚Äúget married‚Äù is a dangerous life objective
	  
	  ‚ÄúFind someone that you are excited to do life with‚Äù will lead to a more successful outcome. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AmandaMGoetz/status/1420012755952734213))
	- What would you add? 
	  
	  I have so many more. Might need a second thread. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AmandaMGoetz/status/1420012757223624705))
