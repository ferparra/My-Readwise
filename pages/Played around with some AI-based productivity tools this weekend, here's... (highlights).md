	- 1. [gemsnotes.app](https://gemsnotes.app/) is a self-organizing whiteboard, that can pull out and organize info from multiple sources (emails, note-taking apps, docs). Helpful to summarize lots of content when you're in the brainstorming stage and joting down your ideas all over the place. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx9ss75echjmgzrrwk2rqe94))

	  Interesting brainstorming tool to supercharge your team (or solo!) brainstorm sessions. I was impressed with the quality of content generated to keep my brainstorm session going, especially when I started running out of ideas.
