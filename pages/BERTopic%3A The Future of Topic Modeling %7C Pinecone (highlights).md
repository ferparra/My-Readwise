	- Machines with a human-like comprehension of language are pretty helpful for organizing masses of unstructured text data. In machine learning, we refer to this task as topic modeling, the automatic clustering of data into particular topics.
	- BERTopic takes advantage of the superior language capabilities of these (not yet sentient) transformer models and uses some other ML magic like UMAP and HDBSCAN (more on these later) to produce what is one of the most advanced techniques in language topic modeling today.
	- UMAP will attempt to preserve distances to the kth nearest point is what UMAP attempts to preserve when shifting to a lower dimension.
	- TF-IDF is a popular technique for identifying the most relevant “documents” given a term or set of terms.
