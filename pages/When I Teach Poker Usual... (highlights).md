	- When I teach poker usually as a charitable giveaway here is my approach:
	  
	  1) Find out what they typically play
	  2) How experienced they are
	  3) What their goals with poker are
	  4) What they struggle with and want to improve

	- Then I will cater the lesson to their needs and try and teach them a few key concepts they can take with them to their home games, tournaments, or whatever it is they play. 
	  
	  No more than 3 concepts typically, otherwise it can be overwhelming.
