	- Retention in Relationships, Optimizing = recharging
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* To maximize retention in a relationship, spend time learning as much as possible., * To recharge, do things that don't require concentration, like watching anime or playing board games.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  My retention brain kicked in. I wonder if you have retention brain for life itself? I do. Every time I'm talking to someone, I'm like, okay, I wonder- Well, I've loved ones.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Like spending time with loved ones thinking, we could be doing something much better right now.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yes, no, that is a serious problem. Well, so we'll pause the Beast Burger question. Yes, but that's why my current girlfriend, which I was telling you before when we were talking about this, is she has a genuine love for learning. And that's something I have. Like, I always feel like I need to be learning something to justify the time I'm spending. And so that's why it's such a nice trait because I feel like that time is being used optimally because whether we're watching a documentary or we're going and taking IQ tests or reading about whatever, just why modern art is a thing, I don't know, one of the weird thing we decide to do, I'm always learning and improving so it justifies the time.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So to maximize retention in your relationship, you want to spend time with that time learning as much as possible?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, which, conveniently, I don't have to force, right? Or I want to be recharging. So when I do work, I can hit the ground harder and luckily we're into a lot of the same things, which happen to be learning sometimes it's not learning, like maybe watching an anime or something like that. But I'm a big believer in your either, if you, well, if you, if your goal is to be like a super successful entrepreneur, you need to either be working or you need to be doing something that decompresses and recharges you so you can work again. If your goal is to be like a really kick ass opportunity or obviously we're going this down to like a very basic thing. And so the things you're doing your doubt time when you're not working, if it doesn't recharge you, you're screwed. You're just a ticking time bomb waiting to implode. And so you got to like heavily recharge and like, so like watching for me, anime or whatever it is playing a board game, like that is actually kind of crucial to my success, which takes a lot of maturing to come to that conclusion because I used to be the kind of guy that wanted to work every hour of the day. And I tried to train myself to not need that stuff. And I, you know, and I almost presented like that. I have to do these kinds of things and it would piss me off because it's not optimal. And, you know, I just really want to make content and entertain people. But as someone who's gone down that road and, you know, you just work every day for two, three months straight and, you know, every hour of the day and then you just a bomb waiting to explode and lose your mind. And the only real sustainable thing is to just like give yourself time to recharge in between working. So there's a kind of balance you have to find. You have to. Even, and I hate it more than anyone else.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Because I, you know, you hate not working. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Because it's just not optimal for time. Like it's, it's, it's as a human, I do need to occasionally watch a mindless show and play a board game. And it took me a very long time to like come to peace with that and not, I would have like borderline panic attacks when I do it. Cause I think I just, what am I doing right now? Why am I doing this? I should be, you know, like, what if one day I have to lay off an employee because we're not doing so well? Like, how could I justify watching this, this show or whatever I'm doing right now? You know, it's like, there's a lot of things like that that go on in your head, but it's necessary. ([Time 1:43:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/40bbd3eb-efba-45b2-9f40-6456c36e860a))
