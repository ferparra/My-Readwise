	- How to get lucky üëá ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734878609424385))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- First let‚Äôs take a step back.
	  
	  That headline tweet probably made you cringe a little.
	  
	  I get it. Me too!
	  
	  Most people hear ‚Äúluck‚Äù and have a visceral negative reaction to it.
	  
	  But why? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734881121816580))
	- 2 reasons:
	  
	  1. Nature - we love stories and circumstances where the outcome was a defiance against all odds. This is David v. Goliath
	  
	  2. Nurture - everyone knows someone that is more successful than them because of happenstance and it *really* bothers them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734885764902914))
	- Luck is the opposite of what we value at our core.
	  
	  Luck is random, a handout and undeserved.
	  
	  It isn't the product of hard work. It isn't earned. It isn't meritocratic.
	  
	  But is that really true?
	  
	  Yes and no. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734887480340484))
	- I think there are 2 kinds of luck:
	  
	  1. Pure Luck - This is the lottery. Your ticket is selected for no rhyme or reason.
	  
	  2. Manifested Luck: This is formulaic. You individually can increase the probability of a positive outcome.
	  
	  Focus on manifested luck. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734889682386946))
	- Here‚Äôs a simple definition and formula for manifested luck.
	  
	  Definition: The surface area of your serendipity.
	  
	  Formula: (Focus) * (Intention) * (Effort) * (Skill) * (Relationships)
	  
	  What do each of these components mean? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734891985018881))
	- 1. Focus - Breadth (and/or) Depth.
	  
	  Figure out what game you're playing.
	  
	  You can go deep or wide.
	  
	  Neither is "right or wrong", but they are different. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734894363004929))
	- 2. Intention - A willingness to commit
	  
	  Once you've figured out what game you‚Äôre playing, switch your attention to "how" to play the game.
	  
	  Each of these decisions carries its own weight and impact.
	  
	  But don't overanalyze every decision - speed and iteration is most important. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734896598790145))
	- 3. Effort - The energy behind your willingness to commit
	  
	  There's no shortcut for hard work.
	  
	  This is a quantity and quality lever - you have to consistently put the time and the reps in.
	  
	  Most "overnight successes" have been 10 years in the making. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734899949953024))
	- 4. Skill - Competence and capability
	  
	  There are 2 dimensions to this element.
	  
	  1. What are you uniquely good at now?
	  
	  2. What can you become uniquely good at with time?
	  
	  Whenever you start something new, you aren't going to be good.
	  
	  Keep pushing through and persisting. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734902051348481))
	- 5. Relationships - Find your personal accelerators
	  
	  When you embark on this journey, you‚Äôll meet all sorts of people.
	  
	  Latch onto the ones that will keep pushing you to get better. 
	  
	  No successful outcome is ever a function of one person. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734904190484480))
	- I like to layer each of these 5 elements with a few basic principles:
	  
	  Principle 1: Think Long Term
	  
	  There will be lots of opportunities as you start getting momentum to get short term wins.
	  
	  Sacrifice those for bigger long term wins. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734908099579910))
	- Principle 2: Be a Net Giver
	  
	  Find ways to add value for others before extracting value for yourself.
	  
	  You're doing it right if the other person is thinking: "what's the catch?"
	  
	  Keep giving relentlessly to the universe and it'll come back to you in spades. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734911190769667))
	- Principle 3: Be Genuine
	  
	  This won‚Äôt work if you‚Äôre transactional or faking it.
	  
	  It has to be real. People are smart - they can sense if you‚Äôre doing something with a motive.
	  
	  The counter is also true. People want people they like to win.
	  
	  Genuineness comes out ahead. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734914542026755))
	- Principle 4: Be Patient
	  
	  Check out my header. @jackbutcher designed it and it left an imprint in my mind.
	  
	  Anything worthwhile takes a while to build.
	  
	  Externally, you won't have much to show for it.
	  
	  Internally, you're building a foundation.
	  
	  Slowly and then suddenly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734916852994053))
	- You don‚Äôt need every element figured out.
	  
	  There‚Äôs a chronology at first:
	  
	  Focus ‚Üí Intention + Effort ‚Üí Skill + Relationships
	  
	  But once you get the flywheel going, all of these things interrelate really nicely.
	  
	  Each element individually can supercharge the other 4. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734920653090823))
	- We‚Äôre about to enter 2022.
	  
	  There‚Äôs never been a better time in human history than today to get after it.
	  
	  It‚Äôll take time but the results will come.
	  
	  And when the results do come, you'll wonder why you didn't start earlier. I know I did. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1472734924218241025))
	- Best of luck!
