	  Absolutely. I heard something about that recently. It's speaking as if, and yes, I totally believe that. It's not a guarantee that you will, that if I talk about myself as a person who goes to the gym, that I will become a person who goes to the gym, and it's a nudge to the system. It's a disruption. It's one of the many things that can create the conditions for me to become a person who goes to the gym.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  What does it mean to create the conditions? And what are the most useful ways that we can think about creating the conditions for success or results, or however you want to think or define that for you?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Creating a conditions is an idea that is one of the core ideas moves in complexity. So if you're wanting to make a change in a complex system, which since each of us as human beings is a complex system, creating the change of becoming a person that goes to the gym, that's a complex, that's a change to a complex system.

	- What Is Subject and What Is Object?
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Listening is important for growth and development., * Listening for what is subject and what is object is important., * Listening below the surface is important.)

	  On the other end of the spectrum, there are very particular techniques that help people listen. Well, for me, the most important one has been really the training and understanding of adult development theory, particularly the one that my colleagues and I are most have most depth in, which is the subject object theory that it was developed by Bob Keegan and others. And in the subject object theory, you're what you're listening for the stage of development is defined by what is subject and what is object. And when I say subject, what I mean is like what you're fused with. It's like the water you're swimming in, the lens through which you see things, but you don't actually even know you have a lens. And what is object is what can be held out and examined and talked about like a value is object if you can see how it's shaping what you do and don't do a value is subject if it's invisibly shaping what you do and don't do, for example. So in this subject, this growth edge coach training that several of my colleagues and I run, what we're teaching coaches to do is to listen for what is subject and what is object. In listening in that way, you have to be listening below the surface of the story. And every time you hear a word or phrase wondering, hmm, I wonder what that person means by that. And so it's amping up curiosity. It's really, really foregrounding the fact that we each of us never really knows what another person means. And so we can only be curious to find out.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I like the word curiosity. When I think of listening, I think of seeing the world through the other person's eyes. I don't have to agree with it. I want to see what they see and I want to understand what they understand. ([Time 0:43:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4d8d079b-d1fe-4b2d-a519-9b732e4bd480))
	- Listen to Win, Listen to Learn and Listen to Fix
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Listening can be applied to words, emotions, and body sensations., * It is important to practice noticing connections between different aspects of our lives.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  I love these phrases, listening to win, listening to learn. I'm going to take this back and incorporate it and I'll report back to you on how it works.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  There is another one that you might find helpful, which is we call it listening to fix. And this is probably by far the most common one. So listening to win is let me make the problem go away by telling you you don't have a problem. Listening to learn or listening to C is getting underneath literally really getting underneath what's being said and reflecting back to the person. And listening to fix is let me take your problem and solve it for you or help you solve it. So just so you have the whole repertoire.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  No, I mean, this sort of comes back to manner for Mars, women are from Venus in a way, right, which is women typically listen to learn men typically listen to fix problem solve. And this creates a divide between us or in your word earlier instead of a divide it creates space between us. But we tend to think that listening just applies to words, but we can also listen to our bodies. I mean, our emotions are feelings. These all come from the same systems that produce our words and our bodies tend to respond to our environment more than our words or quicker than our words. How can we learn to listen to our emotions, our feelings, our body and what it's telling us.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  This one, I'll start with how someone else can help us do that. And this is what a lot of coaches do this coaches who pay attention to the people's somatic experience is simply to ask. So if you were to say, Shane, I feel really like I have to get this thing done right now. I'm so busy. I can't be distracted by anything else. I might say. So where do you feel that in your body? And if you're unused to even noticing that you have a connect that there's any that there's a connection, you might say, what do you even mean by that? I don't know. And then I might just like invite you to turn your attention inward and to see if you can scan and notice if there's any connection and what it might be between any kind of sensation in your body and this sense of being super busy and don't have time for any distractions. So this is where another person can be so, so helpful. It's about creating noticing connections between things that are happening in our head, which is what most people are used to noticing and what's happening in our bodies. So it's just practice that way, really. I like that question. ([Time 0:54:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cab64819-6498-4a4a-8d57-bff5d3974819))
