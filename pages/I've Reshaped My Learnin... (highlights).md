	- I've reshaped my learning loop in the last three years. it sits atop a layer0, similar to @fortelabs's #BASB. The learning loop is focused on deliberate practices and capabilities. I found it more pragmatic for people with a busy life and not involved in full time research. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mantaq10/status/1610050666541776898))

	- The loop has five components aimed at creativity, each to be mastered on a maturity curve. These components also divide a typical day naturally. 
	  
	  1. creating Cycles
	  2. creating Capital
	  3. creating Closure
	  4. creating Clarity
	  5. creating Capability ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mantaq10/status/1610050668244656129))
	- Creating cycles is about setting the rhythms of the day, working on one's activation [[energy]] as @anthilemoon writes about. Its a set of rituals for carpe diem. For me, its dream [[journaling]], hiking, grooming, meditating, gratitude journaling and organising the day and coffee. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mantaq10/status/1610050669893021696))
	- Creating capital is what [[learning]] and life is about, as @hubermanlab  put up, creating a fossil record of our lives. This is a [[deep work]] phase where i focus on working on an artefact that will outlive me, time boxed to avoid perfectionism. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mantaq10/status/1610050671495249920))
	- Creating closure is paying the dues of life. Tasks, closing leftovers, collaborating, calibrating and clarifying work. This is the component that can be mastered by elimination through delegation, automation or creative neglect, @oliverburkeman style.

	- Creating clarity is critical thinking to extract principles, evergreens, key ideas from systematic reading and maintaining a zettelkasten @soenke_ahrens style. clarity makes capability possible, builds a map of a domain or skill or practice and chalks out pathways to progress.

	- Creating capability is a product of competency (skills) and capacity (comes from all of the above components). Right now i've got 31 deliberate practices that i am learning to master. Besides joy, this is the primary goal of learning. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mantaq10/status/1610050676478050304))
	- Next day, week, month, quarter and year, the components loops over like the habit loop @JamesClear  style, except these are more cohesive practices built up on atomic habits. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mantaq10/status/1610050678323572736))
	- Besides building a [[second brain]], im experimenting on building a better augmented life. Hungry for feedback. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mantaq10/status/1610050679967744000))
