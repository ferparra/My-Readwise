	- Been thinking about this tweet since AutoGPT came out, and this week was finally able to build a demo! Using @LangChainAI and @Replit, I was able to quickly prototype an agent that can collaborate with humans to accomplish a task, all within @Threads!

	- Here's a quick demo:
	  
	  Input: "I am working on a project with Rami and Chris. Please find out the current status of our project, and write a status report",
	  
	  Output: The agent chats with Rami & Chris, and posts a thread summarizing the updates it gathered https://t.co/NZZaQmjXDS ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rami_rustom/status/1656782920219254784))
