	- How To Evaluate People's Decision Making?
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* There are a variety of ways to evaluate someone's decision making., * One way to evaluate someone's decision making is to run them through a scenario and see what choices they make., * Another way to evaluate someone's decision making is to ask them about the last mistake they made or about their years of experience.)

	  How do we evaluate people's decision making?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  How do you evaluate their decision making? You run them through a scenario, see what choices they make, find out what their rationale is, find out the reasons that they're picking one thing over another, and use that to determine if you think that their mental model is rich enough. Another, I told you, was asked people, tell me about the last mistake you made. Or you can use years of experience, just don't take it all that seriously. So there's a variety of criteria that you can use. You can use their track record. Have they had a track record of successes? But none of these are foolproof. I may have, I may be an investor, and I have a track record of calling the market right in the last five times. And people say, wow, really knows what he's talking about. But there are lots of people who are trying to predict which way the market is going to go. And some of them are going to get it right by chance. And people assume it's because they know what they're doing. And in fact, they're just the lucky ones. So you can't rely on performance, and you can't rely on years of experience.

	  To your point about explaining rationale and sort of why you made a decision in the variables that you consider, and maybe how those variables interact over time, I think organizations partly get in the way of this because they might write a summary of why they're doing something. But it's so high level, it doesn't actually contain much thought or reflection in the thinking, which also prevents people from learning from other people, how they're making decisions and developing expertise.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  You're exactly right. So what you're saying is that we need to go beyond a simple surface explanation of why people did things. What my colleagues and I talk about as cognitive interviews to get beyond the surface explanation to find out how do you sizing this situation up? What were you noticing? And what inferences were you drawing? And we can be asking people those kinds of questions to get into their head more deeply rather than I figured the market was due for a correction or something like that. I thought about an idea called the decision scorecard for an employee. I sit down with the employee, and I actually have used it several times, and I say, let's go back in the previous year. What were some of the major decisions you made? And I come to the meeting with what I think were the decisions, the employee comes with their decisions, that we prepare notes, and then we look at the decisions and say, which ones worked and which ones didn't. Now, some decisions may have been good decisions that didn't work through no fault of the employee. And some may have been bad decisions that worked because the employee got lucky. So you can't just look at the outcome, but you have to look at what was the person thinking about when they made the decision. And I think that's where there was a success or a failure. And my experience is that this decision scorecard method of evaluating people is much less stressful. And the employees, and I enjoy it because we're all learning a lot as we go through it.

	  And the decision that requires you to have knowledge of what you knew at the time, what you were thinking at the time, not retrospectively going back and trying to piece it together because now you have new information. And we've written a lot at Frontom Street on the concept of decision journals. I'm curious as to what information, if you were going to create a journal that an employee had to fill out every time they made a decision, what information would you put in that decision journal. And then use at these meetings where you're evaluating their decisions later on. ([Time 0:22:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f6e25e9f-8884-48b6-ab27-17bfbb28d0da))
