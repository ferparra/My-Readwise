document_note:: In this episode of Huberman Lab, Dr. Craig Heller discussed the science of temperature regulation and how it affects the body and brain. He provided tips on how to use cold to improve performance and recovery, such as taking a cold shower before exercise and cooling the face, hands, and bottom of the feet for faster cooling. Dr. Heller also warned against using cold towels or sponges on the neck as it can send false signals to the brain. He also discussed hypothermia, NEAT, and tips for better sleep.
