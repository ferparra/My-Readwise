document_note:: This book argues that the sequence of technological revolution, financial bubble, collapse, golden age, and political unrest has been repeating itself roughly every 50 years. This is due to the interaction between three features of capitalism: clusters of radical innovations forming technological revolutions that modernize the productive structure; the functional separation between financial and production capital; and the greater inertia and resistance to change of the socio-institutional framework relative to the techno-economic sphere. The cycle from irruption to frenzy to tipping point to synergy and finally maturity is described, along with the role of financial capital in providing funding for the next technological revolution. The importance of regulation is also highlighted.

	- Installation leads to turning points which leads to deployment
	  
	  1.  The turning point has to do with the balance between individual and social interests within capitalism. It is the swing of the pendulum from the extreme individualism of Frenzy to giving greater attention to collective well-being, usually through the regulatory intervention of the state and the active participation of other forms of civil society
	  2.  Related services, cultural adaptation, education, regulation all come up
	  3.  Becomes ubiquitous, common sense which leads to coherence. When exhausted and tired, ripe for new paradigm ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt04ber6myz79q82y2c6d1cp))
		- **Note**: This document discusses the balance between individual and collective interests within capitalism, and how this balance can lead to technological revolutions. It explains that when individualism is at the extreme, it can lead to a frenzy, but when collective well-being is given greater attention, it can lead to regulatory intervention from the state and other forms of civil society. This can result in related services, cultural adaptation, education, and regulation becoming ubiquitous, leading to a period of coherence. Eventually, when this period has been exhausted, it can be ripe for a new paradigm.
	- Financial vs. Production Capital
	  
	  1.  Financial capital - invest, money to make more money
	  2.  Production capital - builders, scaling more profit, making capacity
	  3.  Little knowledge in an area vs. a lot; foot loose vs. roots
	  4.  When productional capital is in control (post bubbles) it leads to real wealth creation
	  5.  Financial capital should be the facilitator, not the game itself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt041fs026jqzpzhb06npq4b))
		- **Note**: This document discusses the two primary types of capital, financial and production capital. Financial capital is money used to make more money while production capital is used to build and create more capacity and profit. It also explains the difference between having a little knowledge in an area and having a lot, as well as between being foot loose and having roots. When productional capital is in control, it leads to real wealth creation, and the document argues that financial capital should be the facilitator, not the game itself.
	- When the companies (engines of growth) start seeking unorthodox ways to deploy their profits, that stage is at maturity (M&A, conglomerates)
	  
	  1.  In maturity, financial capital also becomes unorthodox. Idleness leads to bad loans
	  2.  Provides the funding for the next paradigm ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt04b2w2ahmamxe2jzpa2256))
		- **Note**: This document discusses how when companies reach the maturity stage of their growth, financial capital also shifts to become more unorthodox. This can lead to bad loans, but it also provides the funding for the next technological revolution.
