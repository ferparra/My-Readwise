	- 1. A thread on the CDC’s recommendation to de-isolate five days after the onset of symptoms or positive test.
	  
	  First, a disclosure: I was paid as a consultant for this work, done in collaboration with @Color Health, which provides COVID testing services and vaccination logistics. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938654579544065))

	- 2. Many public health experts were surprised and concerned when on December 27th the CDC reduced the previous (and rather conservative) ten day isolation period to a five day period with no antigen test required to exit isolation.

	- 3. The CDC did not provide much justification for the decision, but this is the sort of question one can address with computer models. We (@RS_McGee, @ay_zhou, @hewillia34, David Brazel, and I) have spent the past ten days working on this. Here is an early peek at our findings. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938658253766657))
	- 4. All of this is highly preliminary; errors are possible but we wanted to share quickly given the ongoing debate. 
	  Quick summary: to my surprise, the CDC's recommendation of a 5-day isolation period is well-supported by our mathematical models across a broad range of parameters. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938659604307968))
	- 5. Under some parameter values, a six-day isolation period might be better, but the difference is small and most likely vanishes in the face of the high community prevalences we are seeing during the omicron wave. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938661034590211))
	- 6. Let’s look at our analysis in a bit more detail. 
	  
	  We modeled the spread of Omicron in a workplace of 1000 individuals using @RS_McGee's SEIRS+ framework. This is a stochastic SEIR-type model with epidemic spread taking place along a contact network.

	- 7. We updated the model structure and parameters to account for the differences between Omicron and the  variants we had modeled in our earlier work. The new compartment diagram represents a population with mixed vaccine status and prior infection to previous variants. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938663865720835))
	- 8. Two parallel compartment models track boosted (open boxes) and non-boosted individuals (solid boxes). Agents may begin as boosted (B), non-boosted but with some prior immunological experience from vaccination or prior infection (R_pre), or entirely immunologically naive (S).

	- 9. Omicron can infect individuals previously infected with other variants. Breakthrough infections are possible even for boosted individuals, but we assume that Omicron infection is 100% protective against Omicron reinfection during the 90-day time period of the model. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938668747902978))
	- 10. Without knowing the shapes of the epidemic curves we are about to see around the country, we cannot readily model changing rates of introduction from the community. Instead, we track the progression of a single transmission chain in our population of 1000. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938670350442497))
	- 11. For the runs I will show here, we have assumed R0=6 (minimal NPIs) and weekly proactive testing. We assume 30% of symptomatic individuals isolate even without a test. We want to explore how the length of the isolation period affects the total size of the transmission chain. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938671700692993))
	- 12. Because Omicron kinetics remain uncertain, we consider mean infectious periods ranging from 3 to 8 days (all with CV~0.4). The fig. below shows the mean number of infections in the transmission chain, averaged over 5000 simulations. Shading is one std. dev. around the mean.

	- 13. Above we see that long isolation periods lead to fewer cases than short ones, particularly when the infectious period is long. But—and this is key—there's very little difference between isolating for 10 days or isolating for 5 days unless the infectious period is quite long. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938677170049026))
	- 14. Let's look at how this translates into cases prevented. The number of cases covaries with the infectious period, so we take a baseline with no isolation and see how much better we do with isolation periods of 2, 3, 4 days, etc. Our results for weekly testing are shown below.

	- 15. First, the benefits of isolation are limited when infectious periods are very short. This is because people don't know they are infectious in time for isolation to help much. 
	  
	  Second, as infectious periods get longer, short isolation periods (2-4 days) are inadequate. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938682924593155))
	- 16. Third, for infectious periods <6 days, 5 days of isolation is about as good as anything. For infectious periods ≥6 days, 5 days comes pretty close. The CDC's recommendation is looking pretty darn good thus far. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938684296130564))
	- 17. The frequency of testing has a strong impact on the value of isolation. The more often you test, the more cases you prevent, irrespective of isolation period. This is unsurprising and simply means that testing works, and testing more frequently works better.

	- 18. Then there's the issue of deisolation testing. Should you require a negative antigen test to leave isolation on day 5? The CDC says no. The UKHSA wants 2 negative antigen tests on days 6 and 7. Fauci floated a trial balloon for a single test to deisolate. We modeled this too. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938690960945155))
	- 19. We found no need for deisolation testing when the isolation period is similar in length to the mean infectious period. When the isolation period is shorter, isolation testing becomes important—but requiring 2 negative tests on the same day is overkill. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FIlAkbXUYAUQTEI.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938695054594050))
	- 20. So far we've just looked at cases prevented—the more the better.  We need to balance this against the number of isolation days the result from a given isolation policy. The figure below shows the today number of isolation days across the entire population over 90 days. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FImzTnpVEAAPPlO.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938699315998723))
	- 21. Here the number of total isolation days scales approximately with isolation period. That's unsurprising. What we want now is to find an isolation period that is as short as possible while capturing most of the benefits of isolation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938701337628672))
	- 22. The figure below shows population-wide isolation days on the x axis and cases prevented on the y axis, for three mean infectious periods: 3 days, 5 days, and 7 days. Notice the inflection point on each curve where the benefits of increasing isolation period become small. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FInKvhNVQAATJhM.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938705263521795))
	- 23. Increasing the isolation period up to that point is great. Beyond it, you are basically just adding isolation days for very little benefit. These inflection points are similarly timed irrespective of testing cadence, albeit with higher benefits from faster cadences.

	- 24. We don’t know the exact infectious period, but the CDC recommendations are spot-on if it is about 5 days. If it is a bit longer, one could stand to increase the isolation period to 6 or 7 days. If a bit shorter, one might get away with reducing the isolation period somewhat. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938713010376704))
	- 25. In addition to total isolation days, we might also care about how many people are isolated at once. For example, schools must be above an attendance threshold (often 75%) for a school day to “count”; employers may need a certain number of people to keep operations running. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479938714428055553))
	- 26. The plot below shows the average peak number of people in isolation out of 1000. Testing weekly, the longer the isolation period, the more people out at peak. But when testing more often, a longer isolation period can actually decrease the peak number in isolation.

	- 27. I want to add an important bit of context: as mentioned above, here we are tracking a single transmission chain. When community cases are low and introductions into the workplace are infrequent, no problem—you’ll only have one or two chains ongoing in a workplace at a time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479939561673269248))
	- 28. In the heart of the Omicron wave, it’s going to be a different story. Tracking transmission chain size makes sense because you still want to keep each chain as small as possible. But your risk threshold for bringing someone back to the workplace should be higher. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479939562822520832))
	- 29. During a massive wave, community prevalence may be 5%, 10%, or more. (In a workplace with proactive testing, it should be somewhat lower). The fact that random individuals are rather likely to be infected too should shade your judgment toward letting people return sooner. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479939563984351233))
	- 30. If you are going to stay open at all:
	  
	  As soon as a known case is far enough along to be a lower transmission risk than a random draw from the workplace at large, they should be allowed to return. This further supports a short isolation period during Omicron. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479939565095772162))
	- 31. So there's an early look at our findings; I first saw these graphs just a few hours ago myself. Later on I'll add a bit about how isolation policies impact the total number of isolation days across the population. 
	  
	  We'll post a working paper in the next few days as well. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479939566253461506))
	- 32. In summary, the CDC recently switched to a 5-day isolation period with no de-isolation test provided that symptoms are resolving.
	  
	  Communication problems aside, our models suggest that this is a more sound scientific recommendation than many people thought. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1479939567524347907))
