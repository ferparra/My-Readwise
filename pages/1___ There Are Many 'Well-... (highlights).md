	- 1/ There are many 'well-acronymed' frameworks for how we interact with TfTs/note-taking systems.
	  
	  Ultimately the activities boil down to one of four things:
	  Input, Retrieval, Organising, or Output
	  
	  Reducing the latency between these activities is crucial for unlocking digital joy

	- 2/ How do these four areas apply to writing and task management?
	  
	  Input: Capturing or creating
	  
	  Retrieval: Searching or organic re-rediscovery
	  
	  Organising: Structuring, managing, editing or processing
	  
	  Output: Publishing or completing ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1515661879867154434))
	- 3/ One oversight is that they are usually expressed linearly, whereas the interplay tends to be non-linear.
	  
	  Writing on a particular topic? Pull-up reference notes/prompting questions. See something out of place? Re-arrange it. Remember some task/todo? Quickly jot it down. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1515661882668969987))
	- 4/ This is not an endorsement of multi-tasking: I'm all for separating 'maker' vs 'manager' time & reducing context switching.
	  
	  However, applied thinking is dynamic & cannot be reduced to 2-dimensions. Reducing the friction between the different activities is instead necessary. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1515661885453967365))
	- 5/ Organisation is often the chief stumbling block for input and retrieval: "where do I put this?" and "where do I find that again?"
	  
	  Networked outliners like @Logseq and @RoamResearch (& sort of @obsdmd with pluginsðŸ¤”) allow us to side-step the upfront organisational burden. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OneStuttering/status/1515661888222216194))
	- 6/ How do they do it?
	- 7/ I'm all for left to right frameworks (particularly diagrams!), but finding the flow between these activities has been transformative for me, so much so that I think I'm going to come up with my own acronym. Let's give it a go:
