document_note:: The Black Swan is a rare event with an extreme impact that is only retrospectively predictable. People tend to create explanations to make it explainable but in reality, it is much harder to predict. It is important to focus on robustness to errors rather than improving predictions and to be aware of the complexity and unpredictability of nature. People should favor experimentation over storytelling and evidence over theory. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the consequences of decisions rather than their probabilities, to act rather than predict, and to avoid overspecialization.

- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Feb 18th, 2023]]
	- Human nature makes us concoct explanations for black swans *after* he fact, making it explainable and predictable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyed3bh6jcjns7d4vpvct4))
	- People often get into trouble as they tend to learn the precise, not the general. Also, people tend to only learn facts and not rules ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyenhkrynb35xqrzy9ag5e))
	- Platonicity - mistaking the map for the territory, forcing categorizations and forms when it is inappropriate (almost always) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyet6njtf8aghf8vzh3vzp))
	- History is opaque. You see what comes out, not the script that produces events, the generator of history ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyf05631r73sn01mwe5661))
	- Triplet of opacity - the illusion of understanding (world is more complicated than we realize); retrospective distortion (can only assess matters after the fact); overvaluation of "factual" information ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyf3c8qjm315mt1e6d0gs7))
		- **Note**: Sometimes it's hard to understand why certain things happen because the world is complex and it's hard to predict what will happen in the future. We can only figure out what really happened after it has already happened. We often rely on facts and information, but they don't always tell the whole story.
	- Extremistan (real world) where Black Swans exist and have a huge impact (notion of Bill Gates distorting average wealth in a group) vs. Mediocristan (average) where there is no person tall/heavy enough to distort group averages ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyfp4n335azxqhxgms80fr))
		- **Note**: In some places, one person can have a big effect on the group, like Bill Gates having so much money that it changes the average wealth of a group. This is called Extremistan. Other places are more average and no one person can have enough of an effect that it changes the group. This is called Mediocristan.
	- Blindness to black swans can come from: error of confirmation, narrative fallacy, human nature is not programmed for Black Swans, distortion of silent evidence and we "tunnel" (focus on a few well-defined sources of uncertainty) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyg8y48r6ny2d57c47dahs))
		- **Note**: Sometimes, people don't recognize Black Swans because they make mistakes, like only believing things that confirm what they already think, making up stories to explain things after they happen, not expecting Black Swans, not paying attention to all the small bits of evidence, and only focusing on a few things.
	- Naive empiricism - finding evidence of what suits your beliefs (NED - no evidence of disease vs. END - evidence of no disease) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyh9nfw93vgncn8emdq08q))
		- **Note**: Naive empiricism means that people believe things to be true without looking for proof. For example, someone might believe that there is no disease present even though they haven't looked for evidence that there isn't any disease.
	- Prediction, not narration, is the real test of our understanding of the world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyjar3rbxv60pvcf0z6vsq))
	- Ideas are sticky - once we produce a theory, we are not likely to change our minds - those who delay forming theories are better off ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyjj3rws62vbv4rx45cgx5))
	- Choose to follow evidence over theory as we cannot explain everything and often underestimate the complexity of nature and biology ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyjzeyhr0fdmve3bak45w1))
	- We fail to learn about the difference between our past predictions and the subsequent outcomes (when we think of tomorrow we just project it as another yesterday) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyk39eze6zfj7rqg3z1z23))
	- Randomness is incomplete information (opacity) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyk7g4agaqkh97x8q5a8vd))
		- **Note**: Randomness means that we don't always know what will happen. Sometimes it can be hard to figure out what will happen next.
	- Doesn't advise always withholding judgment, opinions, predicting, being a fool - but be a fool in the right places. Avoid unnecessary dependence on large-scale harmful predictions. Avoid the big subjects that may hurt you in the future. Do not listen to economic forecasters or to predictors in social science but do make your own forecasts. Know how to rank beliefs not according to their plausibility but by the harm they may cause ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshymbqm7g26f7yngsbr05jz))
		- **Note**: This passage is telling us not to be too quick to judge or make predictions about things. We should avoid believing predictions that could hurt us in the future. Instead of listening to predictions from experts, we should make our own forecasts. We should be careful about what we believe, and think about the harm it could cause us.
	- Make many small bets with asymmetric payoffs and where the harm is minimal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyn1tstcnsef8r0ce9znyp))

	- Trial and error means trying a lot ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshynkpd513dg32cww1vtpsr))

	- Nobody in particular is a good predictor of anything ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyp8y8bxcd084qtxmk9xpw))
	- Luck is the grand equalizer ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyphnptt608ak2w9zsv050))
	- Study the intense, uncharted, humbling uncertainty in the markets as a means to get insights about the nature of randomness that is applicable to psychology, probability, mathematics, decision theory and even statistical physics . You will see the sneaky manifestations of the narrative fallacy, the ludic fallacy and the great errors of Platonicity (going from representation to reality) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyq5m5kdf6b8ky1aejab8x))
		- **Note**: Studying the markets can help us to learn and understand more about how unpredictable things can be. This knowledge can be used in many different areas like psychology, math, and science. We can also see how people make mistakes in their thinking and how they may not always understand the difference between what is real and what isn't.
	- Volatility does not equal risk ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshystbt1d1jyhh01ceekje7))
	- There is no reliable way to compute small probabilities ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshysdxwwb2zmayf30nxkcez))
	- **How to move from the Third to Fourth Quadrant (Black Swan)**
	  
	  1.  Have respect for time and nondemonstrative knowledge
	  2.  Avoid optimization; learn to love redundancy (do not overspecialize)
	  3.  Avoid prediction of small-probability payoffs - thought no necessarily of ordinary ones
	  4.  Beware the "atypically" remote events
	  5.  Beware moral hazard with bonus payments
	  6.  Avoid some risk metrics
	  7.  Positive or negative Black Swan?
	  8.  Do not confuse absence of volatility with absence of risk
	  9.  Beware presentations of risk numbers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyrbesp0phyf32zazs2jqa))
		- **Note**: The Black Swan suggests that in order to move into the Fourth Quadrant, one should respect time and knowledge, avoid optimization and overspecialization, be aware of remote events and moral hazards, avoid certain risk metrics, and be careful with presentations of risk numbers. Additionally, one should consider whether a Black Swan event is positive or negative. Lastly, volatility should not be confused with absence of risk.
	- **10 Principles for Black Swan Robust Societies**
	  
	  1.  What is fragile should break early, while it's still small
	  2.  No socialization of losses and privatization of gains
	  3.  People who were driving a school bus blindfolded (and crashed it) should never been given a new bus
	  4.  Don't let someone making an "incentive" bonus manage a nuclear plant - or your financial risks
	  5.  Compensate complexity with simplicity
	  6.  Do not give children dynamite sticks, even if they come with warning labels
	  7.  Only Ponzi schemes should depend on confidence. Governments should never need to "restore confidence"
	  8.  Do not give an addict more drugs if he has withdrawal pains (no leverage)
	  9.  Citizens should not depend on financial assets as a repository of value and should not rely on fallible "expert" advice for their retirement (investments should be for entertainment)
	  10.  Make an omelet with broken eggs (have the right people like entrepreneurs take the risks, not bankers; smaller firms with less effects if the fail) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshyt643vafn1x1czv16b8vy))
		- **Note**: The text outlines 10 principles for creating robust societies in the face of Black Swan events. These principles include: breaking fragile systems early, avoiding socializing losses and privatizing gains, not giving those who have previously failed a chance to repeat their mistakes, compensating complexity with simplicity, avoiding risky activities, not relying on confidence to sustain systems, not enabling addiction, not relying on financial assets as a repository of value, and encouraging entrepreneurs to take risks rather than bankers.
