document_note:: In The Social Animal, David Brooks uses a narrative of two fictional characters, Harold and Erica, to illustrate how our upbringing and environment shapes behavior and decision making. He argues that people are driven by universal feelings of loneliness and the need to belong, and that unconscious thoughts and emotions have a greater influence over us than we care to admit. He also touches on the importance of cultural trust and how it has been broken down in the United States due to fractured political parties. His TED talk further explains how the ideas from his book can be applied to everyday life.
