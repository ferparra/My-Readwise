	- idk about u guys but the biggest lie I repeatedly told myself between the ages of 10-24 was that “intellectual challenge” was going to make me happy & satisfied in life. happiest I’ve ever been at work was at a cafe pulling coffs, flirting with hot mums & listening to tame impala ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gbrl_dick/status/1430289347228561409))

	- the reason I am currently not at a cafe talking about deleuze with 19 year olds is that it dawned on me p quickly that, while work was not a source of happiness per se in my life, it was one way to shift things in the direction I wanted them to go & build things bigger than me ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gbrl_dick/status/1430290189461508098))
	- lot of people I went to school with too weak to face up to this have found it easier, for whatever reason, to Stockholm syndrome themselves into believing that they actually looove working at mckinsey or w/e. “the people are so great! and I’m really good at my job!” lmao ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gbrl_dick/status/1430301791996944387))
	- nothing wrong with doing high status, high pay work! but they’re only paying for ur labour — don’t become a mckinsey collaborator against ur own self-knowledge. just optimise the bread industry or cuban blacksites or w/e & don’t lose sight of what u plan to do w/ status & money ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gbrl_dick/status/1430302858100965380))
