	- **Semantic search** denotes search with meaning, as distinguished from lexical search where the search engine looks for literal matches of the query words or variants of them, without understanding the overall meaning of the query.[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search#cite_note-1) Semantic search seeks to improve [search](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_technology) accuracy by understanding [the searcher's intent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_intent) and the [contextual](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_(language_use)) meaning of terms as they appear in the searchable dataspace, whether on the [Web](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) or within a closed system, to generate more relevant results.
