	- I "death spiraled" Luna. Tail end scenario assumption: Anchor fails completely, 100% of $11B UST on Anchor want out of Terra ecosystem. What happens to Luna? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pedroexplore1/status/1506396351311097865))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- For the uninitiated: ALL Luna staking rewards come from fees previously accrued by Terra. When someone mints UST a swap fee % is charged in UST. When someone burns UST a swap fee % is charged in Luna. When UST expands Terra accrues UST fees. Contraction = Luna fees. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pedroexplore1/status/1506396352556765194))
	- Luna staking yields stablecoins+Luna. This has a beautiful property in which [ unlike ETH, BTC, AVAX etc whose staking return depends purely on coin price ] as Luna price drops, yield goes up naturally since (stablecoin+Luna)/Cheaper Luna = higher APR.

	- Important to repeat: Staking comes from FEES accrued, not inflationary levels to entice user to stake like most cryptos. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pedroexplore1/status/1506396359158644742))
	- One last thing. There is no limit how much UST can be burned/minted but it is a function of swap fee tolerance. The more you are willing to pay in swap fees the more UST you can burn. 
	  
	  LET'S DEATH SPIRAL! 95% Luna price drop. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pedroexplore1/status/1506396360307888137))
	- Rational Actors: 2% swap fee tolerance (willing to take 98 cents per UST), takes 43 to happen.

	- Urgent Selling: 10% swap fee tolerance (90 cents per UST), takes 8 days to contract.

	- Total Panic: 50% swap fees, takes 1.3 days.

	- What did we learn: 
	  
	  In all scenarios where Luna falls to $5, based on the current accrued fees in Terra, Luna becomes an asset that can yield you 5.87% in dollars alone. 
	  
	  On top of that it will ALSO yield you 1-24% in volatile asset.
	  
	  All from ACTUAL fees. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pedroexplore1/status/1506396378762727424))
	- Just for fun, let's assume 70% staking conviction is too high. Let's say only 35% (we lose 50% of all stakers).
	  
	  Now "death spiral" = 11% yield in dollar denomination. And 58% in total. (from FEES!)

	- My only question is: Does this sound to you like a distressed asset? 
	  
	  To pay 30% APR, other blockchains mint away their token to incentivize staking. And here you have an asset that can payout that 30% in diversified dividend assets...
	  
	  and people are fudding. https://t.co/Ft2eJ3muZx ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pedroexplore1/status/1506396395883962377))
