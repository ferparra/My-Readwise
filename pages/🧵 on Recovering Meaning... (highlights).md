	- By comparison: We know how to solve climate change; we don't know how to solve postmodernity.
	  
	  Postmodernity makes it likely we won't act to solve climate change, because it has destroyed the necessary institutional capacity. https://t.co/Rvpj6Jlpnk

	- This 🧵 summarizes long-form discussion on this web page. It suggests implications of the _Meaningness_ analytical framework for upcoming social change. (Disclaimer: not an area in which I have any particular expertise.)

	- 🔨 Three conceptual tools, which I apply to everything:
	  
	  1⃣ The pattern and nebulosity of meaningness are inseparable
	  2⃣ Particularly, all boundaries & distinctions are nebulous but patterned
	  3⃣ So system function is inseparable from context and purpose

	- Palladium asks key questions. As stated, I have to answer “yes” and “no” respectively—not what they want to believe. But I can affirm what I imagine is the question behind the questions, with answers that may align with their vision.

	- [[Modernity]] is an “eternalism”: an attempt to fix meanings on solid foundations. Meanings are nebulous, so they can’t be fixed. [[Eternalism]] is mistaken and harmful. https://t.co/WqQgTYX3UQ https://t.co/g6MmN0csCq
	- “Postmodernity” just means that, by now, pretty much everyone realizes—implicitly or explicitly—eternalism is wrong, and meanings can’t be nailed down.
	  
	  Monotheism is also an eternalism. God is indeed dead. I don’t believe He can be shocked back to life https://t.co/BBXhPAMAkf
	- America’s loss of [[Christianity]] has been somewhat disastrous, just as its loss of [[modernity]] has been. The replacements we’ve created so far have been, on balance, worse.

	- Having collectively believed that meanings were guaranteed by God and/or Newton, then realized they aren’t, the natural alternative is nihilism, the denial of meaningfulness. Postmodernity strongly tends toward nihilism… https://t.co/4y4M9piOss
	- Fortunately, meaningfulness is obvious everywhere, so you can’t actually be a nihilist. Instead, we tend to flip back & forth between nihilism & eternalism. This is characteristic of postmodernity.
	  
	  Its simplistic ideologies combine certainty & incoherence https://t.co/Y4j4jbTqAF https://t.co/hKnE9kwDc7
	- Can we recover notions of higher purpose, teleology, and even theology in a postmodern world?
	  
	  No, if “postmodern” means “rejecting rationality, universality, and coherence.”
	  
	  Yes, if it includes all possibilities for a future after modernist eternalism… https://t.co/jTgRhBSrBj https://t.co/OxKKNgbura
	- “Metamodernity” is sometimes used to refer to a hypothetical social and cultural mode which recognizes that meaning is real and displays relatively reliable patterns, but also that it is nebulous, variable, interactional, contextual, purpose-dependent. https://t.co/Y4j4jbTqAF https://t.co/11IayCyZx4
