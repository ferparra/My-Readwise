	- DX in @liveblocks is absolutely mad.
	  
	  See this React hook?
	  
	  It grabs a real-time object named `person`. Every time the object changes, this hook automatically updates with the new value.
	  
	  No back end, no setting up WebSockets ðŸ¤¯ it just works.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- What about updating the value? Well that's easy too.
	  
	  This function works like `useCallback`, but gives you access to real-time storage.
	  
	  Just call `changeName()` and `person` updates for every user.

	- Want to have a shared text input? Simple, just combine the two code snippets above, and you've got it.
	  
	  Multiple users, one input. https://t.co/OSYE74AVjR ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ctnicholasdev/status/1650849860114067456))
	- Here's what the full code looks like.
	  
	  It's even more impressive than you think though. When you start building more complex apps, a number of problems arise.
	  
	  âœ¦ Multiple users editing at once?
	  âœ¦ Nesting data structures?
	  âœ¦ Flaky connections?
	  âœ¦ Undo/redo for each user?

	- Conflict-free data types automatically handle all this for you, and even more. Not to mention, you can also read your real-time data with our:
	  
	  âœ¦ APIs
	  âœ¦ Webhooks
	  âœ¦ JavaScript package
	  âœ¦ DevTools extension

	- The team actually wrote a fantastic interactive article on the problems of multiplayer undo/redo, really interesting stuff.

	- I've only mentioned conflict-free data in this thread, but @liveblocks actually enables much more, for example:
	  
	  âœ¦ Displaying real-time presence
	  âœ¦ Broadcasting custom events
	  âœ¦ Document browsing
	  âœ¦ Customisable collaborative comments (coming soon)
	  + more! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ctnicholasdev/status/1650849901692211200))
	- Building real-time collaborative apps like Figma or Notion was not an easy taskâ€”until @liveblocks came along. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ctnicholasdev/status/1650849904431087616))
