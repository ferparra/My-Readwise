	- I described some of the most beautiful and famous mathematical theorems to Midjourney.
	  
	  Here is how it imagined them:
	  
	  1. "The set of real numbers is uncountably infinite."

	- 2. The Baire category theorem: "In a complete metric space, the intersection of countably many dense sets remains dense."

	- 3. Zorn's lemma: "A partially ordered set containing upper bounds for every chain necessarily contains at least one maximal element."

	- 5. The Banach-Tarski paradox: "Decomposing a solid sphere into a finite number of disjoint subsets, and then reassembling those subsets to create two spheres identical to the original one."

	- 8. GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems: "In any formal system of axioms, there are true statements that cannot be proven within the system and the consistency of the system cannot be proven by its own axioms."

	  This is not my typical content: I usually post math explainers here. However, this was my first time trying out Midjourney. Now, I am hooked.
