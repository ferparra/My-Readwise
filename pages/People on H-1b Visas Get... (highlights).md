- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Jan 31st, 2023]]
	- People on H-1B visas getting laid off have 60 days to leave the US.
	  
	  Many have begun an 11 year long green card process but are 5, 10 years away from getting it. 
	  
	  Employer lays them off, and it’s all gone. 🙅🏼
	  
	  Pack your bags. 
	  
	  There’s a solution nobody is talking about: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855495350853632))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- You can have stability, and not have your life upended by an employer’s whims or a declining economy or a goddamn pandemic.
	  
	  The key: 
	  
	  Get another visa that YOU control. 
	  
	  I’ve helped hundreds of people get this visa, (I’m on it too 🇨🇦➡️🇺🇸) so trust me, I get it… ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855497733214208))
	- People will say this path is impossible. 
	  
	  It’s simple. 
	  
	  An O-1 visa through an agent.👨‍💼👈
	  
	  I’ll walk through the whole process here, but lemme dispel some bullshit first so people keep reading:
	  
	  ❌ You don’t need a PhD
	  
	  ❌ Or patents
	  
	  ❌ You sure AF don’t need 100 citations ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855498928615425))
	- The O-1 Visa is daunting. It requires “Extraordinary Ability” and the regulations talk about Nobel Prizes. Most people see that and decide they can’t get it.
	  
	  THIS PROCESS CAN BE HACKED.
	  
	  I’ve got this visa three times and I’ve never passed a calculus class. 
	  
	  You. Can. Get. It.

	- Oh, and super important: you can use anything you’ve done in your industry, at any point in time, anywhere in the world, to hit the criteria. 
	  In Bangladesh 4 years ago? Great. 
	  With a different company? Perfect.
	  
	  Okay, let’s see how you can meet the criteria: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855505857585152))
	- There are 8 criteria. 
	  
	  🔘🏆
	  🔘🤝
	  🔘📰
	  🔘🤴
	  🔘💰
	  🔘✍️
	  🔘🧑🏾‍⚖️
	  🔘🔬
	  
	  You can apply for as many as you want. 
	  
	  You need to hit 3. ✅✅✅
	  
	  Here are the criteria, and how I would approach getting the visa.
	  
	  Criteria 1: Awards 🏆 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855507174612994))
	- You need to show you’ve won awards in your field. 
	  
	  You don’t wanna waste time on this, there are easier criteria, but… 
	  
	  You’re a founder? Raising venture capital, winning a pitch competition, or other tech/VC related prize.
	  
	  In tech? Win a hackathon or award
	  
	  2- Memberships 🤝 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855508424527872))
	- This criteria you can hack. Find a “prestigious” group, club, association, accelerator… anything that is the “peer group” of your field.
	  @IEEEorg, @ycombinatorc, @Techstars, @EntrepreneurOrg @OnDeckCapital 
	  
	  Something you apply to, and has an acceptance rate <10%
	  
	  Next: Press 📣 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855509628272641))
	- “I don’t have any press, I don’t like the attention”
	  
	  Suck it up. 
	  
	  Get press about your work. Work in a 5,000 person company that will never mention you in articles?
	  
	  Start a side project. A Git repo. A mini biz. Make friends with journos.  Launch on Product Hunt. 
	  
	  Or cheat… ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855510941093888))
	- Pay for the press. 
	  
	  $ will get you BS Forbes Business Council articles, press releases, into Inc. 
	  
	  Reach out to local papers/ blogs.
	  
	  The strategy isn’t to have a 10pg feature in NYT, it’s to get a bunch of press so you look like a prolific professional on the rise.
	  
	  Next:💰💸 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855512308441088))
	- High Salary
	  
	  Show you’ve been paid, in the top 10% of professionals in your position, in your region, at some point in time. 
	  
	  Making $100k as a SWE in SF? Probably not gonna work. Head somewhere with a lower cost of living for a month or two. Get a job offer to prove it.
	  
	  Or… ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855513541550080))
	- Use a future job offer to hit criteria. You can use annual salary, hourly rate, or total comp/ equity. A high-paying hourly contract is ideal. 
	  
	  Or visit your parents in Poland or Pune for a couple months. Keep your current salary and you should hit.
	  
	  Next - Critical Role 🤴 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855514808246275))
	- Critical capacity:
	  2 parts to this one.
	  1- You have been critical to a business. 
	  2- The biz has a distinguished reputation (is well known/ accomplished).
	  
	  Being critical: Show that you have led a division, department, product, or team that is crucial to the biz. 
	  
	  Some ideas: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855516016218112))
	- If you’re a leader in the company, done. If you’re in a large team, show that you built something important, lead an important team, created a tool, or have specialized knowledge. If you’ve created some IP, built an internal process, etc, this might work.
	  
	  Show biz is awesome: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855517270306817))
	- To show company’s reputation, gather all the press about the company. Show funding in the company from established VCs. Show partnerships with big orgs, or well-known customers. 
	  
	  How would you brag about your company’s accomplishments?
	  
	  Put those together: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855518423719936))
	- You’re a badass that built an internal analytics tool that helps your operations team allocate resources more effectively. This saves $500k/yr and eliminates churn and fraud. 
	  
	  And your company is backed by @a16z, helps Nike, and there are press articles about it.
	  
	  ✅
	  
	  Judging 🧑🏾‍⚖️ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855519589736450))
	- Judging is the opposite of awards. Awards criteria you need to show important ppl in your industry award you something.
	  
	  Judging, show that you are that important person.
	  
	  It’s easier to get on a judging panel than to win an award. Hit up organizers in your industry.
	  
	  Key points: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855520936136704))
	- You need to judge other professionals in your field. 
	  
	  Students often don’t count.
	  
	  Use your network (company, VCs, accelerator, industry groups) to help place you.
	  
	  Get proof: on the website, pictures of you with a mic, etc
	  
	  Scholarly articles ✍️: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855522215362567))
	- You gotta show that you have gone through an editorial process to get published. (Opposite of Press criteria).
	  
	  If you can write an op-ed somewhere, go for it.
	  
	  Don’t write a fucking paper for a journal, waste of time.
	  
	  Next: Original Contributions 🔬 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855523582709763))
	- Original Contributions:
	  Hard to summarize, but essentially you have created some innovation that has changed your industry. An algorithm, a tool, a business model, a device, etc. 
	  
	  You have recognition for this already, or you don’t. This one is tough to fabricate.
	  
	  What’s next? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855524870385665))
	- If you run through that list and you hit 3 ✅✅✅ 
	  
	  Apply for the visa.
	  
	  If you don’t, your next three months are a sprint to get a membership, judge an event, get some press, and have a high-paying hourly contract from a potential client ready to go. That’s 4.
	  
	  The application: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855526149652480))
	- You can’t have an O-1 and an H-1B (or other visa) at the same time. If you’re on a visa, ask your employer to file for an O-1.
	  
	  You need to switch your status from H-1B to O-1 with your employer.
	  
	  Then you will get a second O-1, to have two visas at the same time.
	  
	  Wait, what? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855527386947589))
	- The first goal is to have an O-1 with your employer:
	  You can stay on an O-1 forever, (unlimited renewals, no max at 6 years), you can apply for green card, and they are just treated better. 
	  
	  Once secured, you apply for a Concurrent O-1 through an Agent.
	  
	  What’s an agent? 👨‍💼 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855528586514433))
	- An agent is someone that files your petition for you. They can be an employer, like an agency that contracts you out, or someone that’s part of a company that you set up. 
	  
	  Remember that high-paying hourly contract? Your $200/hr, 3 hours a month contract comes in here.

	- The visa through an agent lets you work for multiple co’s, adding and dropping clients as you please. You can work full time at your main company, but have side projects, freelance, etc.
	  
	  And the most crucial part, you’ve probably figured out already: 
	  
	  No 60 days. You can stay. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Loganullyott/status/1619855536610234369))
