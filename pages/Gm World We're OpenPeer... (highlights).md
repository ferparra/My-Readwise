		- **Note**: Thread
	- If you're outside the western world, buying crypto directly from an exchange or onramp is unheard of.
	  
	  Even if government regulations allow you to buy crypto, you're likely denied by the onramp or get your bank account closed for transacting with a crypto related entity ðŸ˜± ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/openpeer_xyz/status/1628813225239232516))
	- Most onramps charge massive fees typically around 3-4%. Minimum fees around $5 also exist, fine if you're in the US but entirely prohibitive if you're in a developing country.
	  
	  Buying 50 USDT would result in you effectively being charged 10% in fees ðŸ¤® ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/openpeer_xyz/status/1628813226875006978))
	- This has led to P2P being the default way many of us onboard into the crypto sphere. Facilitated by centralized exchanges we send funds directly to another person in our country in exchange for crypto.
	  
	  A peer-to-peer way of transacting, exactly as Satoshi always meant it to be. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/openpeer_xyz/status/1628813228552642562))
	- Even through the bear market P2P volumes have been exploding.
	  
	  Up 40% in India throughout 2022 ðŸ”¥
	  
	  and you may have heard about Nigeria's bitcoin premium where BTC is trading 60% above global spot prices ðŸ¤¯

	- However the current method relies on centralized parties and escrows, which after the demise of FTX we've seen can't be trusted.
	  
	  Jumping from an exchange to self-custody also requires multiple steps with horrible UX, prohibiting self-custodial crypto from reaching mass adoption.

	- In some countries it's even worse. P2P trading happens entirely through Telegram and Whatsapp chats, with unverified traders and scammers abound. The lack of trust signals may work for early adopters but are incompatible if we want to bring the world on-chain ðŸ”— ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/openpeer_xyz/status/1628813235456557061))
	- Enter OpenPeer - buy and sell crypto with fiat directly to and from your wallet with zero-fees. Escrow is completely self-custodial and initiated from your wallet.
	  
	  We'll be integrating with self-custody wallet partners like @minkeapp at launch, with many more on the way soon. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/openpeer_xyz/status/1628813237511680002))
