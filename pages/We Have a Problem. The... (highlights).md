	- We have a problem.
	  
	  The world of online learning is stale.
	  
	  Lack of community, low engagement, and no incentive for completion.
	  
	  THREAD: Here's what’s next for the future of online education ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1446852991139684353))

	- We’re in a post-content age.
	  
	  In the past, educational content was expensive and scarce. It became a major selling point for universities.
	  
	  Today, however, educational content is cheap and abundant. YouTube, newsletters, blogs, and social media all serve as modern universities. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1446852998555176964))
	- And it doesn't stop there...
	  
	  Accelerators, incubators, low-cost or free online courses, and alternative education programs have been created to serve the lifelong learning needs of working professionals.
	  
	  But content abundance has created its own set of unique challenges: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1446853000719486980))
	- First, it’s become nearly impossible for instructors to make a living off their expertise.
	  
	  Social platforms rarely support monetization activities. You post your expertise and have to pursue other ways to capitalize on it.
	  
	  Creators are effectively giving away valuable content. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1446853003592585217))
	- Second, most learners are—counterintuitively—actually worse off for all this cheap, abundant content.
	  
	  More access does not equal more engagement.
	  
	  Example: MOOCs—the massively open online courses that were popularized in the 2010s—have completion rates of just 3 to 6 percent. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1446853005567877121))
	- So we have a problem. How do we fix it?
	  
	  At @MavenHQ, we believe cohort-based courses ("CBCs") hold the key.
	  
	  CBCs are interactive, community-centric online courses where a group of students advance through the material together—with hands-on, feedback-based learning at the core. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1446853007468113921))
	- What makes CBCs unique?
	  
	  They are engaging, real-time, and involve community-driven, active learning (as opposed to solo, passive content consumption).
	  
	  Fixed start and end dates enforce the real-time aspect and create a scarcity within the abundance of content out there. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1446853009267470336))
	- Scarcity drives value. In today’s content-rich world, what is scarce in online learning is community.
	  
	  Cohort-based courses provide community (and so much more).
	  
	  Whether you're a potential instructor or student, come check out what we're building @MavenHQ.
	  
	  The future is bright. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1446853011821768708))
