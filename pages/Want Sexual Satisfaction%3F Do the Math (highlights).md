document_note:: University of Sussex mathematicians have developed the first ever mathematical model of how to reach sexual climax, using data from the four stages of the male cycle to create two equations. Their findings suggest that too much psychological stimulation too early can inhibit the chance of climax and that the female sexual response is more complex. The research has applications for clinical treatment of sexual dysfunction and for improving the general public's sex life.

	- "A key finding is that too much psychological arousal early in the process can inhibit the chance of reaching climax. Simply put, our findings can be summarized as 'don't overthink it.'" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcfxzas2myqyfscw7d3ydpd))
	- The paper, titled "Sex, ducks and rock 'n' roll: mathematical model of sexual response," is published in a special issue of the journal *Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science*. "Ducks" is a reference to the mathematical concept of "canards." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcfybb4jq5zz74hyjqd1dpz))
