	- A small but beautiful project by @raunofreiberg: https://t.co/HWzVxLxp4m
	  
	  Pattern library of common UI components. With a detailed breakdown of expected functionality, best practices, accessibility concerns, and implementation tips for each.
	  
	  Great example of ðŸ’¯ design docs

	- In some alt. utopia we'd have a single, massive, community-curated collection of UI patterns & docs with this level of care and attention
	  
	  There have been a few passes at it (https://t.co/7ryYvDXmu4, https://t.co/NxKhurp6CE, etc) but they're not maintained. Quality is hit or miss ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1609474811532660736))
	- The centralised dream is probably misguided.
	  Would be a burden to maintain (same problems OSS maintainers face), would need funding, inevitable infighting over design directions & project stewardship
	  
	  Decentralised chaos works almost as well...
	  
	  BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT. Pipe dream. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1609474813218758656))
	- I treat @vitalyf's design guides as stand-ins for canonical patterns. Some great ones:

	  https://t.co/aZ36reqzpG
	  
	  Content hubs like @smashingmag help centralise these
	  
	  But I can't help think of all the design craft & expertise stashed in private company docs ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1609476951835828225))
