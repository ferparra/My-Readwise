	- As part of my onboarding as a new PM I defined the following OKRs for the first 6 months.
	  
	  1. Managing the backlog efficiently
	  2. Providing visibility between the business and the dev team
	  3. Generating common understanding among all stakeholders.
	  
	  What do you think?

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ Being ahead of the backlog
	  
	  1. There are at least double the stories written in the backlog than what is necessary to complete in the current sprint
	  2. There are at least 15 estimated stories in the backlog for upcoming sprints ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlmeidaInsights/status/1487919729704685576))
	- 2/ Ensure alignment/transparency between biz and tech
	  
	  1. No sprint will be finalised w/o dev requests labeled as high priority being solved
	  2. Only 1 sprint will be affected by critical topics mid-sprint
	  3. In retros there will be less than 2 complaints about lack of visibility ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlmeidaInsights/status/1487919735199121409))
	- 3/ Ensure shared understanding with the tech and product team
	  
	  1. Only 1 dev cycle is concluded without all agreed scope is 100% done
	  2. Only 3 additional stories are created due to lack of understanding
	  3. Less than 2 hrs/week is devoted to clarifications with the dev team ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlmeidaInsights/status/1487919747069095941))
	- Disclaimer: I'm a junior PM in a IT-oriented company where my official title is PO
	  
	  In the long-term my goal is to create quick-wins in terms of enabling more empowered teams, including all stakeholders in the ideation process and encouraging a data-driven approach to development ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlmeidaInsights/status/1487920588572266499))
	- I'm still figuring out exactly how to do this but User Story Mapping by @jeffpatton and Shape Up from @37signals @rjs are one hell of a starting point :)
	  
	  Any further suggestions are super appreciated ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸ˜Š ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlmeidaInsights/status/1487921222289604611))
