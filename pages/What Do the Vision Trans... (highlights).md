- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- What do the Vision Transformers learn? How do they encode anything useful for image recognition? In our latest work, we reimplement a number of works done in this area & investigate various ViT model families (DeiT, DINO, original, etc.).

		- **Note**: Thread
	- We also reimplemented different models in #Keras. These were first populated w/ pre-trained parameters & were then evaluated to ensure correctness. 
	  
	  Code, models, a tutorial, interactive demos (w/ @huggingface Spaces), visuals:

	- We’ve used the following methods for our analysis:
	  
	  * Attention rollout 
	  * Classic heatmap of the attention weights
	  * Mean attention distance
	  * Viz of the positional embeddings & linear projections
	  
	  We hope our work turns out to be a useful resource for those studying ViTs.

	- We’ve also built a @huggingface organization around our experiments. The organization holds the Keras pre-trained models & spaces where you can try the visualization on your own images.
