- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Apr 13th, 2023]]
	- By 2024 you’ll be able to replace ~50% software devs with GPT-4 agents that run on $10 worth of tokens per hour.
	  
	  The whole “they don’t need sleep or breaks or food” thing?
	  
	  Yeah. That’s real now.
	  
	  Why hire a new employee when you can spin up an AI agent for 1/10 the cost? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1644396717079658496))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- The open source world will speed run this - it’s already started.
	  
	  It won’t be long until everyone knows how to build powerful agents for anything.
	  
	  Building one will be the “hello world” of ai dev.
	  
	  People will now be competing against each other with armies of AI agents. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1644398439583858690))
	- This isn’t meant to scare people.
	  
	  It’s just reality now.
	  
	  This will 100% be possible, because it already is (in an initial form).
	  
	  People need to start learning to adapt rn or else they’re going to find themselves way behind - it’s moving too fast for you to do anything else. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1644404579562569728))
	- The replies of people who disagree are exactly what I’d expect.
	  
	  It’s all people who have built a strong identity and community around dev.
	  
	  They feel the existential threat, but they don’t want to admit it’s changing the core of what they do.
	  
	  So they revert to “crazy ai bro.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1644407878558830592))
	- The correct way to read the original tweet is “wow imagine the gains to human productivity, and solo devs can now compete with large teams this is awesome” and not “omg you are a fear-mongering ai bro doomer” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1644429901070749696))
	- I mean watch this, realize this is an agent that built this for <$1 of GPT-4 credits, and then apply exponential growth to it.
	  
	  And this is just me with a hacky demo!
	  
	  It blows my mind that people can’t look ahead from where it is now to where it’s obviously going. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1644432001699815424))
	- “You’re just saying AI is better at dev work than humans to sell your AI software!” they say as their bios link to paid Python courses. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1644433807351906304))
	- Was it fear-mongering to tell farmers “hey guys this tractor thing is coming you might want to be aware of this” or was that a helpful heads up that they might want to adapt a bit?
	  
	  *and guess what this ultimately grew the pie for everyone, especially the farmers* ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1644440893997613056))
	- Twitter is not a place for nuance.
	  
	  People miss that I said “will be able to” and not “will happen.”
	  
	  I don’t think everyone is going to lose their jobs overnight.
	  
	  But a few people will “get it” and be wayyyy ahead of the curve and spin up agents to *dramatically* boost output. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1644444896303157249))
	- Everyone decided to hear “omg he thinks 1/2 of devs are going to be out of a job in a year” instead of what I actually said…
	  
	  *sigh*
	  
	  Back to building. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1644445643359031306))
	- If you won’t take “fake ai bro wannabe thoughtboi” seriously maybe you’ll take the CEO of one of the most important AI companies in the world seriously :)
	  
	  It’s coming. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1644580453050089473))
