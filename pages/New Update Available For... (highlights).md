	- Quickly access all your favorite, pinned, and open tabs from Arc's sidebar with the "Search Tabs" command. Open them in Little Arc, an incognito window or another space; plus reload & close them!
	  
	  ‚ö° Pro tip: Assign a global hotkey - I use "‚å• + T".

	- I'm considering adding a "Search Arc" command that looks through everything: Open tabs, history and Google suggestions - the common things I search for. What do you think?
