document_note:: Notes from Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky is a difficult work to read, but it serves as an introduction to the ideas found in his later works. The protagonist addresses his innermost thoughts to an imaginary audience and uses the work to criticize Chernyshevsky's novel What Is To Be Done?, which advocated a utopia based on rationalism, utilitarianism and socialism. Dostoevsky argues that this would take away man's freedom, which he believes to be his greatest possession. He also suggests that man needs suffering to improve himself, and that a utopia would rob man of this opportunity. The novel culminates in Dostoevsky's belief that man should have the freedom to choose, even if it results in something destructive. This idea is explored further in The Brothers Karamazov, where the Grand Inquisitor offers man security and happiness while Jesus offers man total freedom.

	- Dostoevsky therefore becomes the champion of the freedoms of man: the freedom to choose, the freedom to refuse, the freedom to do anything he wants to do. For Dostoevsky, then, man's freedom was the greatest thing that he possessed and Dostoevsky thought that in a scientific, rationalistic, utilitarian society man's freedom would be replaced by security and happiness. This is what Chernyshevsky and other socialists were advocating: that if man is given all the security he needs, then man will automatically be happy.
