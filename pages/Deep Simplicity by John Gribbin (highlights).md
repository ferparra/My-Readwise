document_note:: John Gribbin explores the concept of deep simplicity, showing how complexity can arise out of chaos, which itself arises from simple initial conditions. He discusses how many of the shared components of life and different systems are based on this concept and how it is applicable to everything from the laws of physics to artificial intelligence. He also explains how fractals, power laws, and networks are all important components of this theory, as well as the role of Darwinian evolution and the Gaia Hypothesis. Finally, he emphasizes the importance of understanding that humans are the most complex things in the world, yet still made up of simple building blocks.

	- Common theme – explains complex/complicated objects by breaking down to its simplest parts and begin by explaining these ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshz70e5khmabxt5scm7sbnm))
	- Common theme – emergence, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshz6xhr2g168z0chtzvekr9))
	- Chaos begets complexity, complexity begets life ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshz6rprc00gsv0z68j28hp8))
	- World starts witht the simple and eventually leads to the complex ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshz6nf3114wt6s7b5rven9v))
	- DNA is more of a recipe than a blueprint ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshz78c87h0c1dbjsz5pj0af))
	- **All life built on networks** – interconnections between simple parts that make up the complex system (emergence of life from non life)
	  
	  1.  Kauffman’s theory about emergence due to network effects
	  2.  Also, genes control machinery of cell and genes can turn on/off other genes. That is why it is so difficult to cure anything because one gene is interconnected to everything else
	  3.  **Humans are the most complicated things and even we run on very simple rules** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshz7g2x64fgx3a149knd9r7))
		- **Note**: All living things, including humans, are made of small parts that are connected and work together. This connection between the small parts creates something bigger and more complicated. Certain genes turn on or off other genes, and this makes it hard to find a cure for diseases because each gene is connected to many other genes. Humans are the most complicated living things, but even we are made of very simple parts that work together.
	- The most interesting things happen on the edges of chaos ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshz8b5xdccm1fj7kaacb2nn))
	- Carbon plays such a key role in life because it can combine chemically with as many as four other atoms at once (CHON) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshz8tsmk4np9zzvyxgebkzz))
	- Boundary between life and non-life is very blurry ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gshz8y433ep0r9nh6f3q7nsv))
