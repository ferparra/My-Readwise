	- There’s always a trade-off when running A/B tests. Until you’re certain which variant of the test is correct, you can’t make a final decision about which test variant to show. So if variant A is better than variant B, you’re losing all the potential conversions that you could have been getting from just showing variant A to everyone. Likewise, even after making a decision, there’s still some uncertainty since typically tests are called at 95% certainty, which means 1 in 20 tests might have chosen incorrectly!
