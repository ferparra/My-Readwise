	- FRAMEWORK 2: Stop Hiring Execs for Potential
	  
	  Don't overcomplicate hiring.

	  (2) Make sure they fit with the team
	  
	  Rinse and repeat. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1357350703832965120))

	- FRAMEWORK 4: Great Investing is Patience
	  
	  Your job is to wait and prepare and wait and prepare. 
	  
	  Read. Think. Analyze. Repeat.
	  
	  Then, when the right opportunity comes along, strike with conviction.
	  
	  Easy to say, hard to do. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1357350772300783617))
	- FRAMEWORK 5: SIMPLIFY Finance
	  
	  "The best financial models can be done by hand on a napkin. 
	  
	  It should be so staggeringly obvious that it slaps you in the face."
	  
	  Great opportunities are in understanding finance but speaking like a normal person and making it simple. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1357350774469259264))
