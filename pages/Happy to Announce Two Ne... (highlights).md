- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Apr 14th, 2023]]
	- Happy to announce two new things for @logseq graphs that you can use locally as a CLI or run automatically on github as an action ðŸŽ‹ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cldwalker/status/1646629744266313728))

	- First, https://t.co/4O6njHhPcg is another way to publish Logseq as a single page app (SPA). It can easily run any future version of Logseq.  Since it integrates with Logseq's publishing at a lower level it'll likely gain enhancements faster than other alternatives ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cldwalker/status/1646629745390387202))
	- This is an alternative to the popular https://t.co/3DmmVo0yff. Having more choices is good for everyone :) See https://t.co/UrT5QjAN4k for more thoughts on this. @pengx17 Thanks for all your hard work creating and maintaining that github action ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cldwalker/status/1646629746833227778))
	- Second, the latest release of the graph-validator action support custom validations - https://t.co/Zt03HIbRHk. Custom validations are just #nbbjs #clojurescript tests. We're not only using this on our docs but also on personal graphs to enforce modeling and data constraints ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cldwalker/status/1646629748246736897))
