	- Education on SWINGS
	  
	  Understanding what is a Swing is crucial in order to understand Market Structure.
	  
	  It shows us the direction of the market and while it may seem obvious at first sight of the market, many still have trouble defining what a swing is.

	- You could define swing as simply more then 2 consecutive candles moving in one direction
	  
	  When you get a few in the opposite direction you have another one
	  
	  The important thing to note is that HTF swings always have more priority than LTF swings

	- When you zoom-in from an HTF to an LTF you will always find that one HTF swing always consists of many smaller and smaller lower timeframe swings.
	  
	  You could refine this until you'd get to a 1-minute chart or even a tick chart and still you'd see the same thing happening in there

	- An important thing to realize is that you can have many smaller swings inside of one, big swing, and you gotta orientate yourself in this.
	  
	  This takes time and practice to see as all things do but will give you an immense power over the rest when you do.

	- Swings also do not have to break it's previous high or low. They can happen in a contraction with HL and LH also commonly known as triangles.
	  
	  You can also have many moves inside of a one Monthly Bar.
