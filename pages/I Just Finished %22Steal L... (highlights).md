	- I just finished "Steal Like an Artist" by Austin Kleon.
	  
	  It's a short book that teaches you how to have great ideas, find inspiration, and repurpose stuff that already works.
	  
	  Here are 7 rules to follow if you want to find creative ideas in places you've never seen before:

	- 1. Steal or not to steal
	  
	  Stuff isn't "good" or "bad." There is only stuff worth stealing and stuff not worth stealing. 
	  
	  A failed company or a bad painting can influence you just as much as your favorite book. Anything can be used to invoke the muse if approached the right way. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dltnio/status/1615364731984048129))
	- 2. You don't have to be original
	  
	  Quoting Jonathan Lethem, Kleon writes, "When most people call something 'original', nine out of ten times they just don't know the original sources."
	  
	  The Dark Knight Rises has similar themes as "A Tale of Two Cities." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dltnio/status/1615364733292679170))
	- “Everything that needs to be said has already been said," André Gide writes. "But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again.”
	  
	  Don't be afraid to say something that has already been said using different language, illustrations, or examples. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dltnio/status/1615364734639026178))
	- 3. Steal from 100
	  
	  Study one thinker who inspires you. Then, study their influences. Repeat ∞.
	  
	  Gary Panter said, “If you have one person you’re influenced by, everyone will say you’re the next whoever. But if you rip off a hundred people, everyone will say you’re so original!” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dltnio/status/1615364736056713216))
	- 4. Keep a morgue file
	  
	  Newspaper reporters keep a "morgue file" full of dead #ideas and scraps of #stories. This is where they go to reanimate their work later on.
	  
	  Stuff that makes you think "Huh, that's interesting," you should always keep somewhere.
	  
	  (My morgue file:)

	- Kleon explains that artist David Hockney had the inside pockets of his suit jackets tailored to fit notebooks.
	  
	  Arthur Russell wore shirts with two front pockets so he could fill them with scraps of score sheets.
	  
	  (Also, Hockney is a vibe.)

	- 5. Copy, imitate, create
	  
	  Kleon advises copying your favorite artists. You can even go as far as copying books word-for-word to practice the art of writing.
	  
	  Some people frown upon this, but as Salvador Dalí puts it, "Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dltnio/status/1615364747079331841))
	- 6. Create what you want to see
	  
	  People say "write what you know." Kleon disagrees.
	  
	  Instead, he advises creating what you want to see!
	  
	  Have a movie you love? Write a sequel.
	  Have a favorite book? Try writing a new character in.
	  
	  Write what you want to read. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dltnio/status/1615364748530552832))
	- 7. Keep a #routine
	  
	  Kleon writes, “Establishing and keeping a routine can be even more important than having a lot of time.
	  
	  Inertia is the death of creativity. When you get out of the groove, you start to dread the work, because you know it’s going to suck for a while..." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dltnio/status/1615364749910487041))
	- This echoes what Neil Gaiman says about writing a novel. He tells young novelists that the closer they can get their days to feel like Groundhog Day, the better.
	  
	  Wake up, write, go to bed. Repeat.
	  Wake up, create, go to bed. Repeat.
	  
	  Keep a routine. Stick to the routine. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dltnio/status/1615364751332364288))
	- If you're scared to copy, steal, or imitate, I leave you with this quote from Mark Twain that Kleon shares:
	  
	  “It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected.”
	  
	  Don't let great ideas lie around just because they've been used before. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dltnio/status/1615364752762613761))
	- Bonus: Always credit
	  
	  If you steal something, are influenced by someone's work, or share their piece, always credit.
	  
	  Something as simple as (h/t _________) goes a long way.
	  
	  (This means hat tip to __________.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dltnio/status/1615364754239033345))
	- With that, h/t @austinkleon for writing a phenomenal playbook on the art of creativity.
	  
	  If you haven't read the book, I highly recommend it.
