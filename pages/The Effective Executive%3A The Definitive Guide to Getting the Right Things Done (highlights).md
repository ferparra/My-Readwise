document_note:: The Effective Executive is a book by Blas Moros which focuses on how to manage oneself and lead by example. It emphasizes the importance of focusing on strengths rather than weaknesses and of doing one big thing at a time. It argues that executives should focus on contribution rather than effort and prioritize decisions, meetings and roles which will have an outsized impact. The best executives are slow and deliberate in personnel decisions and focus on opportunities rather than problems. They also focus on recording, managing and consolidating their time and know the criteria for success and how to measure it. They consider alternatives and understand before making a decision, and build the execution of the decision into the decision itself.

	- Run lean. An organization is like a biological organism in that the internal mass grows faster than what shows externally - the volume increases as a cube of the linear dimension but the surface area only as the square. You must fight and hold back internal growth which doesnâ€™t help drive profits and goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmma8y0dccm7v1a95rvw7b0))
	- Be useful. Over success. Over wealth. Over fame. Be useful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmfzbfgttqjxw689ed64cr))

	- â€¢   They ask what needs to be done.
	    1.  You must prioritize this list every couple years. Once you tackle the biggest priority, you must redo the process. Can only focus on a maximum of two at any given time
	  â€¢   They ask what is right for the enterprise
	  â€¢   They make an action plan.
	    1.  This must include the name of the person who is accountable, the deadline, who this effects directly and must be made aware, who should be told even if theyâ€™re not effected
	  â€¢   They take responsibility for the decisions
	  â€¢   They take responsibility for communicating the decisions
	  â€¢   They are focused on opportunities rather than problems
	  â€¢   They run effective and productive meetings
	    1.  End once the purpose has been accomplished. Announce the purpose of the meeting at the beginning. Sum up what happened, action items, who is accountable, deadlines, send to everyone involved
	  â€¢   They thought and said "we" rather than "I"
	  â€¢   Listen first, speak last ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmanfk8b8ya6v50ftexa9p))
		- **Note**: The Effective Executive provides guidance on how to get the right things done. It suggests that one should prioritize tasks every couple of years and focus on a maximum of two per time. It is also important to consider what is right for the enterprise, create an action plan with accountability and deadlines, take responsibility for decisions and communication, and focus on opportunities rather than problems. Additionally, effective and productive meetings should be held with a purpose, and the leader should listen first and speak last. Finally, the use of "we" instead of "I" is encouraged.
	- Events should not drive what an executive does. Rather, key criteria which help inform results and contributions should be his main focus. The truly important things are not the trends - they are what cause the trends and is why you should never focus on the events but on what lies behind them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmbf4f74jaj0r95djh9wg7))
	- They know where their time goes
	  
	  1.  Effective executives start with their time not with tasks because they know time is a limiting factor
	  2.  They record their time, they manage their time, and then they consolidate their time into long chunks.
	  3.  What can you do away with totally, what can you delegate?
	  4.  Donâ€™t waste others' time
	  5.  Reduce recurrent and predictable decisions
	  6.  Avoid overstaffing
	  7.  Reduce poor organization such as too many meetings
	  8.  Reduce poor information (wrong form or just wrong)
	  9.  Consolidated time is the key. Most executives donâ€™t have more than 25% of their time at their disposal but if they come in chunks, itâ€™s usually enough. Even if it was 75% but broken up, youâ€™d never get anything done.
	  10.  It is hard and rare to over-prune ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmbqprrnrz9d130xk3n07p))
	- Try to contribute in 3 areas: direct results, adding to culture and values, building the next generation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmc06qxj690pw3dx2mhb18))
	- You should remove incompetent men. Not only because of their lack of results, but because if they stayed on, it would hurt the rest of the culture. This is not a slight on the man but a slight on the leader who put him in the position to begin with ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmc7rqnfmnjy824m03hees))
	- Managing upwards is as important as managing downwards. You must make the strengths of your boss productive as their success and promotions will help you as well. Knowing yourself, and your strengths and weaknesses, and how to make your strengths productive is equally as important. This is an attitude as much as a skill ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmcchzx0kx6qcsx8212j62))
	- Setting priorities and posteriorities (a list of what not to do) is more about courage than knowing what to focus on. You must be future-focused - rather than looking at the past, you must look at opportunities rather than problems, you must be willing to set your own agenda and make your own decisions rather than relying on others, and aim high for things which will truly make a difference rather than playing it safe ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmcj3ae6b0670ngxadv6jg))
		- **Note**: Setting a plan of action and deciding what not to do takes courage. You should think about the future and what could happen rather than looking back at what has already happened. See possibilities instead of problems, make your own decisions without relying on others, and try to do things that will be meaningful and important instead of things that are safe.
	- Effective decisions have these common traits
	  
	  1.  Is this a generic or a specific situation and problem?
	    1.  As generic problems can have rules and principles to deal with where a specific problem must be dealt with individually.
	    2.  Executive executives donâ€™t make many decisions because they donâ€™t have to they figure out which problems are generic and through their rules and principles are able to adapt to situations quickly and effectively
	  2.  They asked themselves if they would be able to live with the decision for a long time. If not, they keep on working on the solution
	  3.  They asked them selves, "what are the specifications of the problem they are trying to solve, what are the objectives, and how will they know if their decision has been a good one?" These are the boundary conditions - the minimum results necessary that must be achieved
	  4.  They ask what is right rather than what is acceptable
	  5.  They ask and figure out how to turn the solution and question into action. Asking who has to know is as important as understanding the capacity of the people involved in acting out the decision. You must build the execution of the decision into the decision itself which is very difficult
	  6.  There has to be a feedback loop. This has to be built into the decision to continuously test the assumptions and the actions as they face reality. You cannot get too removed from the process. You must touch the medium and see if yourself how the actions are being carried out and the reactions to it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmddx1d4f23nz1pjjzgygn))

		- **Note**: The traits of effective decisions include determining if the situation is generic or specific, asking if the decision can be lived with for a long time, understanding the problem's specifications and objectives, asking what is right rather than what is acceptable, turning the solution and question into action, and building a feedback loop into the decision to continuously test the assumptions and actions as they face reality.
	- The best executives consider alternatives and this causes dissension and disagreements which is very healthy and can lead to the better decisions and outcomes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmens5xqhk6xga4jx52mnz))
		- **Note**: The best executives recognize the importance of considering different perspectives and views when making decisions, which can lead to more effective outcomes. This process often involves disagreement and dissent, which is seen as healthy and necessary in order to reach the best possible result.
	- You must begin with trying to understand and only then trying to figure out what is right and what is wrong. Like a first-year lawyer is assigned to argue the other side's case before theyâ€™re allowed to think about their own, we must truly understand all sides before making a decision ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmefcg3v775cgjvp3vmz36))
	- The last question an effective decision maker asks is, "is the decision even necessary?" Better to not act at all if not needed. Act or donâ€™t act. Donâ€™t hedge or go halfway. Only act if your decisions and your actions are needed and important - if things will work out without your involvement, leave them be ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmme65m3c4q1sr4fn6jq82m))
