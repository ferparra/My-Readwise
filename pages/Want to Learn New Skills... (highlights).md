	- Want to learn new skills? Build a learning stack first.
	  
	  A learning stack is a collection of tools and techniques to acquire new knowledge and skills, fast.
	  
	  ðŸ§µ I've helped 100s of professionals think more clearly about their learning process. Here are some of my lessons learned. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1458129097956024321))

	- Skills matter.
	  
	  You need to constantly learn if you want to make it in our Information Age. But how do you decide what to learn, and how do you actually learn it?
	  
	  Building a stack of tools and techniques will help you to learn new skills more effectively and efficiently. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1458129099008794626))
	- It's increasingly difficult to get away with doing things manually.
	  
	  Most of what the average knowledge worker does repeatedly can be automated, and the market is catching on.
	  
	  If you don't learn to leverage technology, you will at some point become irrelevant in your job. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1458129100036472837))
	- Change matters.
	  
	  The skills that helped you for years may now be irrelevant. And skills that didn't exist a decade ago are now essential pillars to get stuff done every day.
	  
	  Excel is no longer a skill worth mentioning on your resumÃ©, but R is. Things change and so should you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1458129101105995778))
	- What are the tools in your stack?
	  
	  We all have computers, email, reading apps, and other ways to consume information. 
	  
	  But how much do you consume deliberately? And how to make sure you remember something?
	  
	  That's the challenge that a learning stack aims to solve. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1458129102221709315))
	- A learning stack isn't just about tools.
	  
	  This type of stack is much more than hardware and software; it's just as much about processes.
	  
	  No tool is going to help you if you don't know how to work with it. And no tool is useful if it's not used. You need to keep showing up. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1458129103324790784))
	- An effective stack is the combination of tools, techniques, and your mindset to learn new knowledge and skills.
	  
	  It's just as much about having a technique to approach a new skill in a structured way as it is about using technology to execute those techniques. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1458129104419495940))
	- Techniques are like processes.
	  
	  Learning techniques are anything that helps you to:
	  
	  â€¢ pick what skills to work on
	  â€¢ choose the materials
	  â€¢ dissect those materials
	  â€¢ assimilate what's in them
	  â€¢ practice applying your new knowledge in a way it becomes a repeatable skill. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1458129105598124033))
	- Tools are anything that supports your techniques.
	  
	  Learning materials are tools, but you also need a way to distill and remember the useful stuff.
	  
	  Once you've distilled relevant knowledge, you need to have a structured way to practice and get feedback.
	  
	  Tools support processes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1458129106780839939))
	- Without techniques, no tool is going to make you achieve your goals.
	  
	  Without tools, taking a systematic approach to learning becomes much more difficult.
	  
	  The trick is to balance the two while focusing on your wanted outcome. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1458129107909156868))
