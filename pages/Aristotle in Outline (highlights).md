	- Philosophy = the love of wisdom ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs56gg1t6edbefwn1h711n7d))
		- **Tags**: #[[philosophy]]
	- For Aristotle, love = desire, wisdom = intuition and scientific knowledge of the most valuable things
	  
	  •   **Goal or end of an activity (thing at which it aims) is key to understanding it**
	  •   **Must not only know something is true, but why it is true**
	  •   Fact = must mean that something cannot be otherwise than what it is, **it is necessary** - if I was not born, it would not violate any law of nature for example. Therefore, I am not a fact but can have facts about our broader species ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs56gs95qtne6xre3cfwp5np))
		- **Note**: For Aristotle, love is wanting something and wisdom is having a good understanding and knowledge of what is important. To understand something, you need to know what it is trying to achieve. You need to know that something is true and why it is true. A fact is when something cannot be any different - for example, if I was not born, it would break the laws of nature. This means I am not a fact, but I can know facts about our species.
	- **First substance** = any individual entity (dog, horse, chair, etc.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs56hv0z8kzhkhetjdkh6rvx))
	- **Second substance** = the species in general
	  
	  •   Can only have facts about secondary substances ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs56hysax5c9jw1sgzqx7x4d))
	- **The Four Causes** (revolves around changes, can be found in every change and don't require an intelligent being)
	  
	  1.  Place - Motion, or change of place
	  2.  Substance - the coming to be or passing away of a thing (generation or corruption - conception, death)
	  3.  Quantity - Growth and diminution (putting on weight)
	  4.  Quality - alteration in quality (changing colors or getting warm) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs56j19h9pnb3ns3z58x6pbh))
		- **Note**: The Four Causes are the different ways that things can change. They don't need an intelligent being to happen. The first cause is Place, which is when something moves or changes position. The second cause is Substance, which is when something is created or destroyed. The third cause is Quantity, which is when something gets bigger or smaller. The fourth cause is Quality, which is when something changes color or temperature.
	- Subject = what is undergoing the change ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs56k7krw8nz3jwcsv9c1500))
	- Seek form by asking what characteristics distinguish the end from the beginning ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs56kenmdvtk2pvbw7m3s0qf))
	- The Vocabulary of Science
	  
	  •   Nature = nature of a thing (the cause of something behaving someway)
	  •   Believed there existed 5 elements - earth, wind, fire, water and ethereal
	  •   Essential attributes - attributes which something must have in order to be that thing. If it didn't it would be something else
	  •   Property same as essential attribute but it can only belong to that species (humans and rationality) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs56kn3zct7xhtftf98vqtvy))
		- **Tags**: #[[science]]
	- The Form of Scientific Explanation
	  
	  •   Demonstration = argument
	    •   Tightness of fit - how strictly the conclusion follows from the premises
	    •   Validity - conclusion follows directly from the premises
	  •   Organon - Six treatises on logic
	    •   Categories - classification of words (substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, position, having, acting, being acted upon)
	  •   On Interpretation (propositions) - simplest sentences
	    •   Prior analytics - identify forms of syllogism which are valid (all A are B...)
	    •   Posterior analytics
	    •   **Point of demonstration is to show the fact stated in the conclusion is necessary**
	    •   **Something can be self-evident (intuition) or needs evidence to be proven as necessary** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs56m5eb5ejj15asjwah0dxc))
		- **Note**: Demonstration is a type of argument that is used to prove something. It is made up of premises (facts) and a conclusion (what you are trying to prove). The Organon is a set of six books about logic. Logic is a way of organizing facts and ideas to come to a conclusion. Categories are words that are used to group things together. On Interpretation is a book about the simplest types of sentences. Prior analytics is a book that talks about valid forms of arguments. Posterior analytics is a book that talks about how to use evidence to prove something. The point of a demonstration is to show that the conclusion is true or necessary. Something can be self-evident (obvious) or it can need evidence to prove it is necessary.
	- The Soul
	  
	  •   For the Greeks, soul = whatever gives life to an organism (therefore, all animals and plants have souls too)
	  •   Only prime matter can create anything but nobody has access to this
	  •   Aristotle differentiates between actuality and potentiality (and differs depending on POV)
	  •   Potential = the capability of something to receive form, or the power to act
	  •   Soul is source of active potentiality
	  •   Soul is that form which enables an organism to carry out life functions (for humans, soul takes form of a living body or a state of activity)
	  •   Rationality is also part of the soul and in that sense the soul is immortal
	  •   Mind or intellect is capable of taking on the form of anything. in this respect, it is like prime matter. it is necessary for the mind to be of no other nature than that of potentiality
	  •   Aristotle claims that active intellect (agent intellect) is only form of soul which is immortal since it is eternal and does not change
	  •   **All that makes the soul "mine" dies with the body (memories, emotions, desires, etc.)**
	  •   Overall, pretty difficult to determine what Aristotle believed the rational soul is ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs56nzbghkkcjp7g2psv3q85))
		- **Note**: Aristotle believed that the soul was the part of us that gives us life and makes us who we are. He thought that the soul had two parts: potentiality and actuality. The soul has the potential to take on any form and it is this potentiality that gives us life. The mind or intellect is the part of the soul that can take on any form and is eternal, meaning it never dies. But all the things that make us unique, like memories, emotions, and desires, die with our bodies. This means that while some part of us lives on, the things that make us unique are gone forever.
	- **Happiness = activity of soul in accord with virtue**
	  
	  •   Life lived virtuously, exercise of critical thinking and appropriately moderated passion, is the happy life
	  •   Basic needs must also be met and must live a decently long life in order to be happy
	  •   **Life devoted to the attainment of wisdom is the happiest life a human can lead** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs56r0yxwkkp4ev52epqpfd6))

		- **Tags**: #[[virtue]]
	- •   **Function of the state is to promote happiness of the people**
	  •   **Politics = science of government - how to run a country**
	  •   For Greeks, the polis was not essentially the land, it was wherever the people were and consisted of the government + society
	  •   Vital to know what the end for which the state exists
	  •   **Aristotle's Politics more concerned with ideal government than any real government**
	  •   **When something is said to be good, one must realize what subject the good is of or for**
	    •   **To understand the nature of a thing is to understand the final cause that is programmed into it and thus governs its behavior** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs56sx6zekprkxzd5xttv9xe))
		- **Note**: "The purpose of the state (or government) is to make people happy. Politics is the science of how to run a country. The Greeks believed the polis (or community) was made up of the government and the people living there. It is important to know what the goal of the state is. Aristotle's Politics looks at the perfect government, not a real one. To understand if something is good, you need to know what it is good for. To understand the nature of a thing, you need to know what its final purpose is."
