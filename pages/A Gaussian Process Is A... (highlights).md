	- A Gaussian process is a collection of (infinitely many) random variables such that the marginal distribution over any finite subset is a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
	  
	  This somewhat arcane description is easier to conceptualize when we focus on a subset of two variables: https://t.co/1VsNX5UdE1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/louistiao/status/1483876891245391880))

	- Inspired by @scien_ti_st's wonderful interactive visualization dashboard: https://t.co/12GZBPfLFA, and @NicolasDurrande's interactive Bokeh plot featured in his fantastic tutorial: https://t.co/Q5ArsAuoUL ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/louistiao/status/1483878772952776709))
	- @scien_ti_st @NicolasDurrande Visualizations like these were conceived by the late @davidjcmackay and have been used to great effect, e.g. in Richard Turner's tutorial: https://t.co/8HuqiMovEp ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/louistiao/status/1483881742444511235))
	- The technique for animating samples from multivariate Gaussian distributions is described in the technical note by @PhilippHennig5: https://t.co/4cg5EY8usd
