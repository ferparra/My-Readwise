	- Imo the addition that would complete this is: psychedelics is a window and a door… to what?
	  
	  Imo it is into the spiritual.
	  
	  Now if I see through a religious perspective: psychedelics offers a viewpoint into the spiritual, yes, but as an entry point it is fraudulent.

	- In the Christian worldview, entering into the spiritual through the use of substances/psychedelics is demonic.
	  
	  Why? It is the perversion of the journey. It is to arrive at the spiritual treasure without the pilgrimage. It is completely unearned and undeserved. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/euwyngoh/status/1616606733048373249))
	- What is true spiritual experience? It is revelatory - the meeting point of the mutual affair between one’s reaching toward and the grace of God.
	  
	  You cannot steal your way through the door. It is premature, and myths have plenty to say about premature rewards. There are costs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/euwyngoh/status/1616606736164745217))
	- The nature and quality of the experience will reflect the quality of the entry point. The spiritual cannot be fooled. It ‘keeps the score’.
	  
	  If you grab hold of what is unearned with entitlement & greed, the spiritual will reflect it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/euwyngoh/status/1616606739172061184))
	- There are many ways to *peer* into the spiritual to learn or satiate curiosity. Psychedelics is only one of many windows.
	  
	  But there is a holy and perverse way to *enter* into it / to grab hold of it. The way to enter it is the way of truth, and that is the eternal way. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/euwyngoh/status/1616606742074527745))
