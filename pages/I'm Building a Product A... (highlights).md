	- I'm building a product and starting a company in the crypto space. My highest priority now is to recruit a world-class consumer product designer to join as cofounder.

	- You can read a lot about the vision of crypto, but you may not realize how much the space resembles the iceberg metaphor. The tip of the iceberg is what I call the "scratch lottery" aspect of crypto. Speculation, pumps, fortunes made and lost. 2/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spakhm/status/1437483469307736064))
	- But that's just the flashy veneer. Most of the real crypto work happens beneath the surface, with world-class engineers, economists, and game-theorists painstakingly rebuilding the foundations of commerce, credit, communication and collaboration. 3/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spakhm/status/1437483472851927040))
	- I wrote about this earlier-- crypto infrastructure is lightyears ahead of what you see on the news or even on Twitter. For years very talented ppl have been quietly toiling at building a parallel universe of decentralized, democratized institutions. 4/16

	- So why don't consumers hear about it? Because this technology is completely inaccessible to people who aren't dedicating every waking hour to crypto. There are multiple structural reasons for this. Some are deeply technical that I won't describe here. Others are cultural. 6/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spakhm/status/1437483483987808258))
	- Which brings me to why I am starting this company and why design is so crucial to crypto that I‚Äôm recruiting a product designer as cofounder. 7/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spakhm/status/1437483486642794500))
	- Deep crypto tech is on the cusp of being accessible to the mass consumer market. Many infra issues got fixed recently; more are on the edge. We can now pull it all together with engineering *and* design expertise to get these products to billions of people who need them. 8/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spakhm/status/1437483489276821507))
	- Since this change just happened now, there has been almost no serious design work done in the field. We don't yet know what the key UI primitives are or how mass market UX will look and feel. All this needs to be invented! 9/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spakhm/status/1437483491713712135))
	- The next chapter in crypto requires both design and engineering DNA at the core of the company-- that means a design cofounder who is deeply passionate about setting the standard for the consumerization of crypto. 10/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spakhm/status/1437483494129557504))
	- An ideal cofounder has:
	- If that's you, DM me! Over the next few months we will work together hands-on to ship the first product and grow the team. Having worked with the best designers at Stripe, I'm very excited to build a world-class design organization! 12/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spakhm/status/1437483499217317889))
	- If you haven't started a company before as a designer, you may have many questions about what this looks like. What does a cofounder do? How does startup equity work? How will it impact your career trajectory? 13/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spakhm/status/1437483501796749313))
	- Fortunately world class designer cofounders cleared the way to make all this easier-- folks like Evan Sharp (Pinterest), @jgebbia (AirBnB), and @garrytan (now investor at Initialized Capital), just as a few examples. 14/16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spakhm/status/1437483504808259586))
	- If you think you may be interested, send me a DM and I'll walk you through what I'm working on and answer these (and many other) questions. Here are some great resources to get you started:
