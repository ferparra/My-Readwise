	- Here's what I believe in:
	  
	  1. The customer is the most important person on the team
	  
	  2. Build a community to help you build better products
	  
	  Let's dive into why community-led product development works: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1403053388066033667))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ Community-led product development is when you invite customers to be part of your team.
	  
	  This concept is nothing new for startups. But many builders stop talking to customers as companies scale. 
	  
	  They make excuses such as: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1403053389370454017))
	- 2/ "It's not my job. I already get customer feedback from other sources (e.g., research, surveys, metrics)."
	  
	  The problem with this excuse is that reading a research deck or looking at metrics just doesn't build the same level of empathy as a direct customer interaction. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1403053390725144580))
	- 3/ "It's too much work, there's a five step process and I have to wait for the next call."
	  
	  Processes are needed as companies scale. However, if they're not lightweight the feedback loop slows down dramatically (from daily customer interactions to weekly or monthly). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1403053392058982402))
	- 4/ "It's not a priority right now."
	  
	  Builders at large companies are often evaluated based on if they moved a metric or if stakeholders are happy.
	  
	  As a result, customers can easily become out of sight and out of mind.
	  
	  So how do builders stay in touch with customers? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1403053393380184072))
	- 5/ It starts with the principle that the customer is the most important person on the team.
	  
	  Team members don't talk to each other once a month. They trade messages throughout the day and talk about both the product and their daily lives. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1403053394609143810))
	- 6/ It’s this daily back and forth dialogue that helps product teams ship better products and build empathy for each other. 
	  
	  The tighter the feedback loop, the better.
	  
	  So how can we replicate this with customers?

	- 7/ Here's how you can build with community:
	  
	  1. Announce your product early and invite customers to join your community.
	  
	  2. Ask customers about their pain points and share product ideas. 
	  
	  3. Don't just talk about the product. Get to know your customers to uncover new needs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1403053401382866944))
	- 8/ Here are a few examples of companies doing community-led product development:
	  
	  1. Musically / TikTok
	  2. Circle
	  3. Stripe
	  4. Twitter ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1403053402704072704))
	- 9/ https://t.co/8B4awbmKju
	  
	  https://t.co/8B4awbmKju became TikTok in the US. The https://t.co/8B4awbmKju product team lived in Shanghai, but their customers were American teens. Here's how they built with community:

	- 10/ Circle
	  
	  In our Build for Creators course, @SidYadav shared how he convinced top creators to use Circle as their community platform.
	  
	  These early customers also helped to spread the word and recruited thousands of people to Circle’s waitlist.

	- 11/ Stripe
	  
	  Stripe PMs like @jeff_weinstein are VERY RESPONSIVE on Twitter. Every Stripe docs page has a feedback box to keep a pulse on customer needs.

	- 12/ Twitter
	  
	  Twitter announced Spaces back in December 2020 and gave it to a small community to try out. 
	  
	  Since then, the Spaces team has been building in public by sharing Figma designs and hosting weekly feedback sessions using the product.

	- 13/ These examples illustrate that you can build with a private community (like https://t.co/8B4awbmKju and Circle) or just build in public to make your entire customer base your community (like Stripe and Twitter). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1403053417031888899))
	- 14/ To recap:
	  
	  1. The customer is the most important person on the team.
	  
	  2. Build a community to talk to your customers about the product and their lives. The tighter the feedback loop the better.
