	- 0/ Intro
	  
	  Who you decide to spend the rest of your life with is probably the most important decision you'll ever make.
	  
	  BUT...
	  
	  No one teaches you about how the dating process works or how women view dating differently from men.
	  
	  Fortunately, these books are here to help. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlexAndBooks_/status/1360376630078758912))

	  If you've ever been called a "Nice guy" this book is for you.
	  
	  The truth is that Nice guys aren't actually nice (I was one once).

	  â€¢ Be masculine in a positive manner
