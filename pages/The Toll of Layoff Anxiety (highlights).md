document_note:: Layoffs have had serious implications on the mental and physical health of workers, as well as their performance and relationships to work. Those who remain in their positions after layoffs live in fear of being the next to be cut, leading to anxiety and decreased motivation. Research shows that job insecurity leads to higher risk of physical and mental health conditions and suicide, as well as decreased productivity and loyalty to the company.

[Employees don’t want to be noticed](https://www.bentley.edu/news/research-tallies-human-cost-downsizing), because that makes them more vulnerable. It’s like animals in the wild – they’ll do whatever it takes to camouflage themselves and fit in. It’s an element of basic survival.” Dollard’s research also shows that these employees were significantly less productive at work.
