	- Logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that undermine the quality of an argument.
	  
	  THREAD: 20 common logical fallacies to learn, identify, and avoid: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445467063074830))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Ad Hominem
	  
	  Latin for "to the person" - an attack of the person rather than the argument.
	  
	  Instead of addressing the argument and its points and merits, the offender attempts to refute the opposition on the basis of personal characteristics.
	  
	  All-too-common in politics. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445468166279170))
	- The Texas Sharpshooter
	  
	  A Texan fires a gun at a barn wall and then paints a target around the closest cluster of bullet holes to create the appearance of accuracy.
	  
	  Selecting and highlighting evidence that supports the conclusion while ignoring evidence that may refute it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445469193838592))
	- The Bandwagon Fallacy
	  
	  An assumption of truth on the basis of the majority of people believing it to be true.
	  
	  "Everyone believes X, so obviously X is true."
	  
	  Typically offered without regard for the qualifications or ability of the people in question to validate the claim. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445470431109124))
	- Straw Man
	  
	  The offender ignores the actual argument and replaces it with a flimsy, distorted, easily-refuted argument (a “straw man”).
	  
	  By replacing a strong argument with a weak one, the offender can create the illusion of an easy, swift victory. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445471714566146))
	- Red Herring
	  
	  The kippered herring was a smelly fish used to distract hunting dogs while training them to stay focused on a scent.
	  
	  "Red herring" is now synonymous with distraction.
	  
	  The offender distracts from the argument with a seemingly related (but actually unrelated) point. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445472759029767))
	- Hasty Generalization
	  
	  Jumping to conclusions.
	  
	  Material, wide-ranging conclusions are made on the basis of an immaterial, narrow body of evidence.
	  
	  Insufficient evidence has been gathered to justify the claimed conclusions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445473824301063))
	- Appeal to Authority
	  
	  The over-reliance on the perspective of an "expert" to support the legitimacy of an argument.
	  
	  The qualifications of the authority figure in the field of question must be considered.
	  
	  Their support can be a feature - but not a pillar - of the argument. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445474868727816))
	- No True Scotsman
	  
	  The "appeal to purity" - the changing of the original argument to evade a counter-argument.
	  
	  You claim a Scotsman never drinks scotch with soda. Charles says he is a Scotsman and drinks scotch with soda. You exclaim that Charles must not be a true Scotsman! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445476164718592))
	- Sunk Cost Fallacy
	  
	  Sunk costs are the economic costs already invested in an activity that cannot be recovered.
	  
	  The fallacy is found in thinking that you should continue on the basis of all that you've put in, with no regard for future costs or likelihood of ultimate success. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445477225881600))
		- **Tags**: #[[favorite]]
	- Non-Sequitur
	  
	  The conclusion does not follow logically from the premises.
	  
	  Presented evidence provides little or no actual support for the argument.
	  
	  “Charles ate fish for dinner and is well-spoken, so he must be a banker.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445478228320259))
	- False Dilemma
	  
	  Presenting only two choices or alternatives when there are many more that exist.
	  
	  Ignores nuance and lends itself to extreme positions.
	  
	  Typically reduces the potential for compromise, as the two options are painted as being extremely far apart. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445479243341830))
	- Tu Quoque
	  
	  Latin for “you too” - attempting to discredit an opponent’s argument by pointing out personal behavior as being inconsistent with their argument.
	  
	  Targeting the hypocrisy of the opponent.
	  
	  “Don’t question my integrity, look at all of the bad things you’ve done!” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445480312975360))
	- Slippery Slope
	  
	  An argument that begins with a benign starting point before using a series of successive steps to get to a more radical, extreme end point.
	  
	  No single step appears ridiculous on the surface, but the connection of multiple steps into a series is highly-improbable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445481432862731))
	- Begging the Question
	  
	  A form of circular reasoning in which the argument is presented in such a way that the conclusion is included in the premise.
	  
	  “Ghosts are real because I once experienced something that had to be a ghost.”
	  
	  Easy to identify. The logic collapses on itself. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445482468761601))
	- Loaded Question
	  
	  Asking a question with a presumption built into the question (pre-loaded!).
	  
	  Typically intended to be inflammatory in nature.
	  
	  The individual on the receiving end of the question is forced to respond despite the baseless, irrelevant nature of the presumption. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445483563528195))
	- Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc
	  
	  Argues that since Event B followed Event A, Event B must have been caused by Event A.
	  
	  Just because B followed A, doesn’t necessarily mean that B was caused by A.
	  
	  Correlation ≠ Causation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445484599447562))
	- Equivocation
	  
	  Comes from the roots “equal” and “voice” -  a single word or phrase can say two very different things.
	  
	  Occurs when the offender uses a word or phrase in an intentionally misleading manner that sounds like it’s saying one thing but is actually saying something else. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445485639700500))
	- Personal Incredulity
	  
	  You are unable to understand or believe something, therefore you argue that it cannot be true.
	  
	  Complex topics often require significant upfront work to understand, so an inability to understand cannot be used to argue the illegitimacy of a claim. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445486654726146))
	- Burden of Proof
	  
	  The inability to provide evidence that a claim is false is used as justification that the claim is true.
	  
	  The burden of proof lies with the person making the claim to provide supporting evidence.
	  
	  The lack of refuting evidence is not supporting evidence. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445487682281482))
	- The Fallacy Fallacy
	  
	  Incorrectly assumes that a claim must be false if a fallacy was used to argue the claim.
	  
	  Just because someone has poorly argued a claim, does not mean the claim itself is definitively false. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1429445488730910736))
