	- It is not the man who has little, but the man who craves more, who is poor
	- Two elements must be rooted out once and for all – the fear of future suffering and the recollection of past suffering – the latter no longer concerns me and the former concerns me not yet
	- The primary indication of a well-ordered mind is a man’s ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company
	- Being everywhere is the same as being nowhere
	- A true friend is someone you trust as you would trust yourself
	- The greater the mob with which we mingle, the greater the danger
	- I am content with few, content with one, content with none at all
	- Material possessions possess us, not the other way around
	- [[Body]] should be treated more rigorously that it may not be disobedient to the [[mind]]. Eat merely to relieve hunger, drink merely to quench your thirst, dress merely to keep out the cold; house yourself merely as protection against personal [[discomfort]]
	- What chance has made yours is not really yours
	- Imagine somebody you really respect is watching your every move and ordering all your actions as if he beheld them (pair with Napoleon Hill’s mastermind group)
	- If can enjoy the bare minimum, there is nothing fortune can snatch away. Simply dependent on oneself for happiness
	- Treat your inferiors as you would be treated by your betters
	- Show me a man who is not a slave; one is a slave to lust, another to greed, another to ambition, and all men are slaves to fear
	- When a man is physically sick he gives up caring for all else? Why not do the same in order to achieve a sound mind?
	- The wise man does nothing unwillingly. He escapes necessity because he will to do what necessity is about to force upon him
	- Huge difference between a life of leisure and a life of idleness
	- There are three serious elements in every disease – fear of death, bodily pain and interruption of pleasures
	- Be your own spectator – seek your own applause
	- I assure you, travel as far as you like, you can never establish yourself beyond the reach of desire, beyond the reach of bad temper, or beyond the reach of fear
	- Nothing is heavy if one accepts it with a light heart and that nothing need provoke one’s anger if one does not add to one’s pile of troubles by getting angry
	- No man is good by chance. Virtue is something which must be learned. Pleasure is low, petty, to be deemed worthless. Glory is an empty and fleeting thing, lighter than air. Poverty is an evil to no man unless he kick against the goads. Death is not an evil. Death alone is the equal privilege of mankind. Superstition is the misguided idea of a lunatic; it fears those whom it ought to love; it is an outrage upon those whom it worships. For what difference is there between denying the gods and dishonoring them?
