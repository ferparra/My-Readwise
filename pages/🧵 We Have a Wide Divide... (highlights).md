	- ðŸ§µ
	  We have a wide divide in terms of how we define empathy in this country. That divide is unbridgeable, and is tearing the country down the middle. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1419642811595509763))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- One group defines empathy as treating people as individuals capable of free choice and deserving of equality under the law. The other group believes that empathy means mirroring solidarity with subjective feelings in policy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1419642939987406849))
	- The former group believes that politics ought to be about solutions geared toward equality of individuals before law rather than expressions of solidarity. The latter believes the opposite. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1419643028919234561))
	- But this creates a serious political asymmetry. That's because empathy-as-neutrality-and-freedom advocates are capable of acknowledging that people feel differently and act differently without treating them as themselves un-empathetic and therefore worthy of ostracization.

	- Instead, say empathy-as-neutrality-and-freedom advocates, you simply bear the consequences of your decisions. "You made the call, and the consequences are your problem" isn't un-empathetic -- it's true empathy, because it acknowledges the full independent personhood of the other. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1419643264261578756))
	- The empathy-as-solidarity and solidarity-expressed-via-policy crew eschews such tolerance. To accept difference in judgment and consequence is to tolerate antipathy, because policies of neutrality inherently disconnect policy and solidarity. That's definitionally un-empathatic.

	- In short, if you believe that empathy means treating people as individuals capable of reasoning and acting under neutral rules, we can have a society. If you believe that empathy means shaping policy around solidarity with subjective feelings, we can't absent serious compulsion.
