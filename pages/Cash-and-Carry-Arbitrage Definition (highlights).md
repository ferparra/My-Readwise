	- What is Cash-and-Carry-Arbitrage  
	  
	  Cash-and-carry-arbitrage is a market neutral strategy combining the purchase of a long position in an asset such as a stock or commodity, and the sale (short) of a position in a futures contract on that same underlying asset. It seeks to exploit pricing inefficiencies for the asset in the cash (or spot) market and futures markets, in order to make riskless profits. The futures contract must be theoretically expensive relative to the underlying asset or the arbitrage will not be profitable.

	- Cash-and-carry arbitrages seek to exploit pricing inefficiencies between spot and futures markets by going long on an asset in the former and opening a short on the futures contract for the same asset. The idea is to "carry" the asset for physical delivery until expiration date for the futures contract.
