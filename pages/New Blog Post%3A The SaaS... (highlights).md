	- With SaaSGrid, founders can anonymously enter their MRR data and a few lines from their P&L, and instantly get a beautiful dashboard with metrics and benchmarks to evaluate the health of their business and easily share with investors.

	- Plus we're making a 24-Hour Guarantee: If you send us your metrics already formatted in SaaSGrid, Craft can tell you whether weâ€™re interested in investing within 1 business day. Just email a link to your SaaSGrid dashboard to saasgrid@craftventures.com. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/1450150503334043652))
	- We hope the phrase "send us your saasgrid" will become common parlance for SaaS financing rounds. It will save everyone -- founders and investors -- a lot of time navigating data requests.
	  
	  We look forward to seeing your saasgrids! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/1450151367566266373))
