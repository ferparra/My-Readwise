	- 🧵Want to learn more about one of the two technologies @ESYudkowsky believes will soon end all life in the universe? Look no further than “Nanosystems”, one of the most interesting and important books I’ve ever read! https://t.co/HK0EmfnC5o ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/perrymetzger/status/1627045047513534464))

	- (Here’s an excerpt from the first page to whet your appetite.)

	- “Nanosystems” is a tour-de-force, an insanely thorough exploration of what you could do if you could build machines in which every atom is bound in a precisely defined location. (If you’re reading this, you yourself are, to a first approximation, an example of what’s possible.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/perrymetzger/status/1627045101678764039))
	- (Wet biology is, after all, a technology based in atomically precise machinery, and so you are nanotechnology. But, just as 787s can do a lot more than birds, artificial molecular machines can do much more than natural ones.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/perrymetzger/status/1627045103440392192))
	- The book also partially (but only partially) explores the question of how you might go about developing the technology to build artificial atomically precise systems, which don’t yet exist, but which are clearly eventually achievable.

	- The book is not an easy read. You need a strong background in chemistry and physics to really understand the “why” behind a lot of the derivations. But if you’re willing to skim and take a lot of the equations for granted, there’s still a bunch you can get out of it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/perrymetzger/status/1627045107018113024))
	- Why hasn’t anyone really pursued Drexler’s vision? That’s a long story. But I *have* read and understood the book, and I think with the exception of some truly unimportant mistakes that aren’t germane to the overall thesis, *Drexler is completely correct*.

	- (I would go so far as to call him one of the greatest minds of the last century. And to me, that’s a high bar.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/perrymetzger/status/1627045110474248194))
	- (It’s also probably one of the most thorough, thoughtful, and carefully written technical works I’ve ever read. It’s truly amazing. Every argument I’ve ever seen against the idea, and I mean *every* argument, is carefully anticipated, analyzed, and refuted in the book.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/perrymetzger/status/1627045112168714245))
	- The book is now over thirty years old, and some of it is no longer state of the art, but it’s still the best introduction to the field and an incredible read. Highly recommended if you’re the sort who isn’t intimidated by equations and deep, detailed engineering analysis. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/perrymetzger/status/1627045113984860166))
	- Will Nanotechnology mean the end of us all? I don’t think so, but if you want to judge for yourself, I can’t think of a better book to read if you want an in-depth understanding of what’s possible. /end🧵 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/perrymetzger/status/1627045116648226816))
