	- concept of Karma Yoga. Karma means “action,” and Karma Yoga is performing action without attachment to the outcome. It’s a way to be in the world, without being of the world. To dutifully do your work, whilst attaining self-liberation from the ego concurrently. Do the good work, but disregard the outcome.
	- When you’re in a mental rut ask yourself: Is it true? Is it actually true? How do I react when I believe that thought? Who would I be without that thought? Turn it around. What if that thought came true? Find 3 reasons life would be better if it came true. These questions are c/o of Byron Katie.
	- Amor fati means "love of fate" or "love of one's fate". It is an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including suffering and loss, as good or, at the very least, necessary. The culmination of your life’s experiences has always happened for you, not to you. Take heart that you are exactly where you need to be at this particular moment.
	- Don’t surround yourself with smarter people. Surround yourself with people who are free in ways you’re not.
	- “An old friend of mine, a journalist, once said that paradise on earth was to work all day alone in anticipation of an evening in interesting company.”  - Ian McEwan
	- When the mind is agitated, we experience sorrow. When the mind is tranquil, joy arises. Happiness is therefore, measured by the tranquility of one's own mind.
	- "If I accept the fact that my relationships are here to make me conscious, instead of happy, then my relationships become a wonderful self mastery tool that keeps realigning me with my higher purpose for living." - Eckhart Tolle
	- in this flurry of stress, I realized the point of mindfulness is for it to be constantly tested. Like muscle-building, it needs to undergo strain, tear, and repair.
	- Only through metabolizing distressing thought loops, can we let trauma soften and dissipate over time.
	- As D.H. Lawrence puts it: "Some people have a lot farther to go from where they begin to get where they want to be—a long way up the mountain, and that is how it has been for me. I don’t feel I am getting older; I feel I am getting closer.”
	- “The great path has no gates, thousands of roads enter it. When you pass through this gateless gate you walk the universe alone.” - Mumon
	- Success is not being on the top of the hierarchy, it’s standing outside of all hierarchies.
	- “The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.” — J.D Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye
