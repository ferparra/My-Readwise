document_note:: In this podcast, Jocko Willink and Darryl Cooper discuss how cognitive biases, mainstream media narratives, and social media corporations are influencing our understanding of the world. They discuss how the 24-hour news cycle and the advent of cable television have created an environment with less time to process information and confirm sources, and how the internet has become a place controlled by those also controlling the mainstream media. They explore the need for a functioning freedom of the press for liberal democracy, and Walter Lippmann's concept of pseudo-environments. They also discuss the Hunter Biden laptop controversy and how social media companies are selling their ability to influence our thinking and behavior. They suggest we should avoid being hyper-judgmental and hyper-emotional and look for alternative sources of information.
