The text encourages people to engage in mindful practices such as conscious breathing, deep listening, and observing the present moment. It emphasizes the importance of understanding and compassion, and suggests that one should strive to live as Buddha and Jesus did in order to manifest mindfulness in their life.

To truly love God, one must care for oneself, others, and the environment, as this understanding of interconnectedness cannot be achieved through intellectual means alone.
