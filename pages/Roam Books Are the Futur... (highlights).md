	- ROAM BOOKS ARE THE FUTURE OF EBOOKS
	  (thread)
	  
	  3 days ago, I published the first @RoamResearch book ever (https://t.co/l9404sbRGK).
	  
	  Once you try this format, you won't come back.
	  
	  Here are 5 of its features (thread, 1/6) https://t.co/mn8wsYyFaA ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca/status/1324053703981207552))
	- 2/ The first feature of Roam books, or rBooks for short, is that they allow for non-linear exploration.
	  
	  Their pages are like Wikipedia pages – they contain links for optional deeper exploration.
	  
	  Moreover, at the bottom of each page, there is an automatic list of references. https://t.co/gMtu1dLdAS

	- 3/ Roam books are still books – they still have a table of content that guides you through your journey of discovery.
	  
	  However, you can stray off the path or take shortcuts as you please. https://t.co/VCqqxU52Lm
	- 4/ Roam helps you see how the arguments connect to each other. https://t.co/5cmkkiEt0T

	- 5/ Roam books are editable.
	  
	  You can add in your own notes or highlight content. https://t.co/da0Pteegtv
	- 6/ More importantly, with a couple of clicks you can create summary pages that automagically contain all references to the selected concept. https://t.co/SwmtjGdjPM

	- 7/ Here's perhaps the most important feature. Roam books can be imported into your own Roam graph! And it will seamlessly link to your pre-existing information.
	  
	  We've never been closer to "downloading knowledge to your digital brain".
	  
	  Not only you download info but connections.
	- 8/ So, here is the first Roam book, on ergodicity. Try it! https://t.co/l9404sbRGK
	- 9/ Moreover, I already began working on a Roam Book on Team Management.
	  
	  It takes from my books "Best Practices For Operational Excellence" and "Teams Are Adaptive Systems" and packages them as a Roam Book.
	  
	  Here it is: https://t.co/pw4PNvIJAK
	- 10/ I'll soon add more reviews of my first Roam book (https://t.co/l9404sbRGK) https://t.co/kQeVIsDKv8
	- 11/ Finally, as the @RoamResearch team and the #roamcult community add features to the app, Roam Books gain in potential too.
	  
	  And as readers add content to their graph, the Roam Books they purchased connect to more info.
	  
	  An application of @zackkanter’s shadow force.
