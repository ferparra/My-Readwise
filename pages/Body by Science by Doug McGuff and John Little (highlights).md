document_note:: Body by Science by Doug McGuff and John Little is a book on how to achieve health and fitness through quick and specific exercises that take 10-12 minutes, and are done only once a week. The Big Five Workout includes exercises with machines, free weights, and low-intensity, steady-state activity, and should be done slowly to allow for progress in small gradations. Rest time between exercises is 30 seconds to a minute, and the program should be followed for 4-12 weeks. The authors also mention the importance of proper hydration, vitamins from food, and the ability to pass on epigenetic changes for four generations. Finally, the book offers specific workout regimens for different sports and for seniors.

	- [The Big Five Workout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USyj-RgHFl0) – Machines (click link for video tutorial)
	  
	  1.  Seated Row – make sure to keep your wrists and elbows in line and pull to your lower sternum
	  2.  Chest Press – do not let elbows get too low – just about as far as they could go if you were doing the press on the ground
	  3.  Pulldown – arms in front of you, using an underhand grip, with hands a little narrower than shoulder-width and bring down to the top of your chest and hold for 3-5 seconds and “slump” into the contraction (bring shoulders down towards hips in a linear fashion). As handles are heading back overhead, imagine moving hands outward in a horizontal plain – loads lats more effectively
	  4.  Overhead Press – move arms overhead with hands in front of you rather than at your side and with palms facing each other. Be cautious of arching the back and putting it in a vulnerable position
	  5.  Leg Press – the farther the angle is from linear, the less resistance you are moving. Should start in a position so that your thighs are perpendicular to the ceiling with knees bent as close to 90 degrees as possible. When pushing out, do not completely lock your legs and do not grip handles too hard as this can drive up blood pressure necessarily high ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4rcg7qbyzd96gm7tt61b0k))

	  1.  [Bent over barbell row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaw-Up9Fkcg) – shoulder width grip, overhand grip (palms facing you) and pull so that it touches your upper abdomen and pause briefly in this position
	  2.  [Standing overhead press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yjwXTZQDDI) – shoulder width grip, palms facing away, do not fully lockout arms at the top and lower to your shoulders
	  3.  [Dead Lift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyJbvWAh6ec) – bend legs imagining that you are sitting in a chair, arms perfectly straight with shoulder width grip, with palms facing you or and over/under grip
	  4.  [Bench Press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT7DgCr-3pg) – do not lock out arms at the top
	  5.  [Squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy28eq2PjcM) – set the safety pins of the rack so it matches with a 90 degree bend of your knees – this is your bottom position, slowly raise up and repeat for your TUL ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4rcmyncxpfdq1n2pjmv64s))
