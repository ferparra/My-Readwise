document_note:: Vagabonding is a way of life that encourages extended travel on one's own terms with minimal gear and plans. It involves simplifying life in three steps: stopping expansion, reigning in routine, and decluttering. Pre-trip homework is essential, while planning should be kept to a minimum. Bring as little as possible and slow down to be deliberate and aware of everything around you. People you meet are key to a successful journey, and pushing oneself out of their comfort zone is encouraged. Be open to new experiences, cautious, and always travel for personally inspired reasons.
