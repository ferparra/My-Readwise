- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- Proof by obviousness: "The proof is so clear that it need not be mentioned."
	- Proof by general agreement: "All in favor?..."
	- Proof by imagination: "Well, we'll pretend it's true..."
	- Proof by convenience: "It would be very nice if it were true, so..."
	- Proof by necessity: "It had better be true, or the entire structure of mathematics would crumble to the ground."
	- Proof by plausibility: "It sounds good, so it must be true."
	- Proof by intimidation: "Don't be stupid; of course it's true!"
	- Proof by lack of sufficient time: "Because of the time constrait, I'll leave the proof to you."
	- Proof by postponement: "The proof for this is long and arduous, so it is given to you in the appendix."
	- Proof by accident: "Hey, what have we here?!"
	- Proof by insignificance: "Who really cares anyway?"
	- Proof by mumbo-jumbo:
