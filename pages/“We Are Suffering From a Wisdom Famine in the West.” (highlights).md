	- we have lost other forms of knowledge that allow us to experience our connection with ourselves, each other, and the worlds we are embedded in. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq4rb2b9cjbgd9mxt8nfcwz4))
	- What is left is information, not wisdom: “People know where to go to find information. But when we ask, Where do you go for wisdom?, the answer is: I don't know. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq4rby0pwwf46gqteqybey20))
