document_note:: This document argues that relying on motivation to get tasks done is wrong and instead discipline should be cultivated. Discipline is separating outward functioning from moods and feelings, which ironically will improve moods and feelings. It is argued that motivation is often unsuccessful in getting tasks done and can result in procrastination. Discipline is a system, in contrast to motivation, which is goal-oriented. Cultivating discipline involves building habits and creating a positive feedback loop.
