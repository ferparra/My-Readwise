	  One is, interestingly, vision doesn't come up in the stack. Does it roll into one of these or do you just like no vision necessary?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I think about vision as part of mission. Cool. I think it's a bit confused about what the difference is between vision and mission. And so when I was originally working on this, there was a version of this that had the mission and the vision together. There were versions that kept it separate. Often what I've heard of as the distinction is the vision is sort of the vision that the company sees for the future. And then the mission is the mission that the company has in light of that vision. And I think you can really bring those two together. You can both describe that world and the role that the company plays in a single statement. And that's usually enough to make progress and help to start to define the strategy. Cool. ([TimeÂ 0:22:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4390c3fb-5fc4-4fa6-99ec-b5f4d7b0993a))
