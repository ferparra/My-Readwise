	- CBT is not the only evidence-based therapy, and I actually don’t always recommend it to people if they already introspect and self-CBT regularly.
	- DBT: Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. Mindfulness based therapy. CBT meets awareness and acceptance training, as well as distress-tolerance.
	- REBT: Rational-Emotive Behavioral therapy. Created by Albert Ellis. Philosophy meets CBT.
	- ACT: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Often the right fit for people who find CBT unpleasant.
