	- Fourier transform on groups turns convolution into multiplication. For non-commutative groups, it is matrix-matrix multiplication though … https://t.co/agPR4YuX0G  https://t.co/A8RlE7TuwM

	- Bezier curve is barycentric interpolation using Bernstein polynomial weights. The most basic method for 2D CAD. https://t.co/17FSkuvXNm https://t.co/Nwk3W0nYeI https://t.co/OGYARvg15a ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gabrielpeyre/status/1523528188617318400))
	- POCS, Dykstra and DR often succeed in finding points in the intersection of possibly non-convex sets. Dykstra and DR usually work better.  https://t.co/VA6YQ8OXTg https://t.co/WVYLnLgQ6z https://t.co/L1TxkS1lzu ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gabrielpeyre/status/1528601617901178883))
	- Nonlinearity matters. Linear diffusion (heat) has non-compactly supported solutions. Non-linear diffusion (porous medium) drives dynamics with compactly supported solutions. The porous medium is the simplest case, studied in details by Otto. https://t.co/rx9jkifR9C https://t.co/h0374qmaWC ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gabrielpeyre/status/1549982501363408896))
	- 1D Optimal Transport distances between Gaussians is the Euclidean distance on the (mean, standard deviation) 2D plane. https://t.co/LcAZAAHUVg

	- Stone-Weierstrass theorem generalizes polynomial approximation to sub-algebra of continuous functions. https://t.co/ngj6ZqA6M8 https://t.co/7cNFafUtzc ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gabrielpeyre/status/1559766973713485824))
	- QR algorithm is a gem of numerical algebra: for a symmetric input, also computes the eigenvectors by multiplying the Q factors (here shows Fourier eigenvectors of a convolution)! https://t.co/Rauq1PlIp8 https://t.co/MY7Xh8v80J ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gabrielpeyre/status/1560491749507846145))

	- Support Vector Machine (Vapnik, Chervonenkis, Cortes) performs classification by minimizing the separation margin between the two classes.  https://t.co/4bE0hMHvph https://t.co/0L0vq4iiOl ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gabrielpeyre/status/1565202791638847489))
	- Functions can be decomposed as the sum of a convex and a concave function on compact domains. In 1D, it can be done in a « canonical » way using the positive/negative part of the second derivative.  https://t.co/MUj2jPXiAH
