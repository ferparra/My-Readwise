	- What is antifragility?
	  
	  How @nntaleb explains this fundamental concept in one of his wonderful probability lectures. üßµ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/carefullycnsdrd/status/1494774246660263949))

	- 1. There are three building blocks we‚Äôll use to get to what it means to be antifragile:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ The difference between X and F(X)
	  ‚Ä¢ Volatility
	  ‚Ä¢ Nonlinear responses ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/carefullycnsdrd/status/1494774248975613961))
	- 2. If X is a random variable, F(X) is the effect of X on you.
	  
	  Example 1: X is unemployment in Senegal, and F(X) is the effect on the IMF.
	  
	  Example 2: X is a stock price, and F(X) is how it affects your bottom line. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/carefullycnsdrd/status/1494774251018141707))
	- 3. We call predicting X ‚Äúforecasting.‚Äù
	  
	  Lots of people try to forecast. But it‚Äôs overrated.
	  
	  The key is to be right about F(X), or the expected payoff.
	  
	  This is the central difference between X and F(X). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/carefullycnsdrd/status/1494774253316624387))
	- 4. Fragile things don‚Äôt like volatility.
	  
	  Consider a coffee cup. If x is a shock to the cup, f(x) is the effect:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Level 1 shock: cup doesn‚Äôt break
	  ‚Ä¢ Level 2 shock: cup maybe breaks
	  ‚Ä¢ Level 3 shock: cup definitely breaks ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/carefullycnsdrd/status/1494774255300587523))
	- 5. Now think about two different sequences of events.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Scenario 1: Five shocks of level 0, then one shock of level 3.
	  ‚Ä¢ Scenario 2: Six shocks of level 1.
	  
	  In both cases, the average shock level is 1/2. But the cup breaks in the first scenario and doesn‚Äôt in the second. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/carefullycnsdrd/status/1494774257326374919))
	- 6. This is because the cup is fragile.
	  
	  You‚Äôd rather take a function of the average shock (1/2) and erase the volatility.
	  
	  In math terms, we say that f(x) is concave in the region where the cup breaks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/carefullycnsdrd/status/1494774260367253505))
	- 7. Everything fragile has this property: in the phases where it breaks, it has an accelerated response function.
	  
	  In other words, the response is nonlinear. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/carefullycnsdrd/status/1494774262430937097))
	- 8. Being nonlinear to harm is an essential feature of being alive.
	  
	  Humans (or financial institutions) that are linear to harm are already dead. Intermediate daily fluctuations in x (which are common) have killed them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/carefullycnsdrd/status/1494774264544776197))
	- 9. This is why financial institutions blow up in the tail.
	  
	  Daily volatility doesn‚Äôt hurt them. But the accelerated response kicks in during a financial crisis. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/carefullycnsdrd/status/1494774266469965825))
	- 10. This is also why forecasting based on past data in Extremistan is deeply misguided.
	  
	  It‚Äôs the unseen (future) data that kills you in the tail.

	- 11. With these key concepts, we are finally ready to tackle antifragility.
	  
	  Consider a ventilator.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Scenario 1: Give the patient 80% of a full oxygen dose half the time, and 120% the other half.
	  ‚Ä¢ Scenario 2: Give the patient a constant, full dose of oxygen. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/carefullycnsdrd/status/1494774270983127050))
	- 12. In both cases, the average dose is 100%. But the results are more favorable in the first scenario than the second.
	  
	  This is because the reactions of the patient is antifragile to pressure in a certain range.

	- 13. For antifragile things (in the range that they are antifragile), we prefer to have volatility for a given average.
	  
	  The reaction of the patient on the ventilator is nonlinear to pressure. And it's convex over an initial range.
	  
	  We say that f(x) is convex in that range. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/carefullycnsdrd/status/1494774275928121351))
	- 14. We see the same effect in options.
	  
	  We prefer that a call option we own with a $100 strike be derived from a stock that closes half the time at $120 and half the time at $80 rather than all the time at $100.
	  
	  Antifragile things prefer volatility. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/carefullycnsdrd/status/1494774277970739204))
	- 15. This is what it means to be antifragile.
	  
	  There are important nuances. For example, most things in life are fragile or antifragile in a certain range.
	  
	  Jumping off a 10m building is bad (fragile range), but jumping 1m is good for your bones (antifragile range). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/carefullycnsdrd/status/1494774279900123137))
	- 16. I highly recommend watching the whole lecture to better understand these nuances:
