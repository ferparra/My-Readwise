	- An org chart is always out of sync with reality.
	- Empowering is the way of moving from group of people to a team.
	- Stable teams, not static.
	- Each part owned exactly by one team.
	- Four types of teams:
	  
	    Stream-aligned: deliver values with minimal hands-offs.
	    Enabling: Grow capabilities of stream-aligned teams.
	    Complicated-subsystem: reduce cognitive load of stream-aligned teams.
	    Platform: make stream-aligned teams autonomous.
	- Intermittent collaboration gives better results than constant interaction.
	- Collaboration is expensive, so it must be planned and justified.
	- Operations is not the output of design, but an input. Jeff Sussna
