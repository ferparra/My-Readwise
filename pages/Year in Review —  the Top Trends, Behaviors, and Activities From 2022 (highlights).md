	- The Lowest Recovery Score Day of the Year
	  
	  Summary:
	  New Year's is one of the most universally celebrated holidays. Monday has the highest average recovery score at 64% on average. January 1, 2022 will be the hardest day for recovery.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  The lowest recovery score day. So folks listening is what day of the year do you think had the lowest recovery score? Take the whole population, take an average. What's the hardest day for recovery? Boom. It is January 1, 2022. We start with the absolute low of the year and actually this is the same as 2021 Emily. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  And I think nobody should be surprised by that. New Year's is one of the most universally celebrated holidays, globally every culture, race, religion, whatever. We see a huge spike in alcohol consumption. Huge spike in alcohol consumption. Huge spike in staying up late till you watch the ball drop or whatever you do. And so if you're at a party drinking, not sleeping, you know, it's almost surprising. That it's this high, you know, with an average recovery score of just under 50%. All right. Looking at recovery by the days of the week.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So Monday has the highest average recovery score at 64% on average. That seems to make sense. Consistent with what we talked about with sleep, it seems like people getting more sleep on Sunday nights, maybe they want to be more prepped for the week. Does that make sense to you?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah. I mean, you know, you're getting all of the benefit of having caught up on sleep over the weekend. You know, a lot of people have opportunities to do things that they enjoy, which is really good for recovery to de-stress. So if you just spent like two days with friends, with family, you know, less pressure, less stressed, that's going to show up. Again, when we're talking about Monday mornings, recovery, it's following, you know, if you're sleep Sunday night. So it's that's really manifesting like all the good that happened over the weekend. And so I think that makes complete sense. ([Time 0:13:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ec0367cd-e47b-4923-8045-8a0905c0134c))
