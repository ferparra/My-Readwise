	- ‚öìÔ∏è As an avid user of @anchor_protocol, I have been able to get exposure to the price of liquid staking derivatives like bETH and bLUNA while borrowing UST.
	  
	  ‚öñÔ∏è But in order for this to continue working, we have to be able to rely on the UST peg!
	  
	  üö™ Enter @WhiteWhaleTerra. üê≥ https://t.co/FZGx0M14WG ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1470893559893184512))

	- 1/ @WhiteWhaleTerra is an arbitrage automation platform built on @terra_money.
	  
	  Instead of relying on a small group of market-makers and whales, White Whale democratizes access to complex automated trading strategies so retail investors can help keep the UST peg.

	- 2/ @terra_money is one of the leading DeFi communities of builders that's sprouted up since DeFi exploded on Ethereum in 2019-2020.
	  
	  For me, DeFi has meant making what was once gated and silo'ed, now permissionless and available to all. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1470893563873570824))
	- 3/ Maintaining the UST peg via community-owned vaults to keep the peg through L1 seniorage arbitrage is exactly the kind of shared opportunity I want to see built.
	  
	  A strong UST stablecoin peg will only make DeFi (especially for Terra users) more secure, robust, and efficient.

	- 4/ With @WhiteWhaleTerra, users will be able to deposit a single asset (ie UST) and get delta neutral exposure earning profits, while increasing demand for UST and making UST-dependent applications more secure.

	- 5/ The most obvious next step to make @WhiteWhaleTerra available to an open community is bootstrapping liquidity in the protocol owned treasury.

	- 6/ Lastly, there are 6 hours left in the WHALE IDO, which uses a familiar (and increasingly popular) reverse auction to avoid rekting participants with initial price pumps.
