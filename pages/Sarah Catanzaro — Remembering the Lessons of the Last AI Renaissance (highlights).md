	- Would You Be More Impressed With a Data ML Company?
	  
	  Key takeaways:

	  It is funny, my co-founder Sean is obsessed with technical interviews, assessing if someone understands how the computer works in his words, which I think is really interesting. I feel like I'm actually not that's kind of like a weakness in mind. I always wonder about a lot of the details there. But it is sort of an interesting perspective. I love working with all of my colleagues who they've been the same drive to understand how everything works. Here is another question I was wondering. I was thinking about if I would have come to you and I had a company in the data ML space. I had a bunch of customers that were really who we think of as tech forward, like say Airbnb and Google and yeah, I don't know, that genre. Would that be more impressive or would you be more thinking I'm likely to succeed than if I came to you at the set of customers who we don't normally think of as tech forward, say like an insurance company, like a large insurance company and a large pharma company, which would you look at and say that that seems like that company is going to succeed? Because part of being sort of like watches technology sort of flow from the more tech forward companies everywhere. But another part of me is like, wow, these kind of less tech forward companies have a whole set of different needs and often like a different tech stack. And certainly there's more of them and they have more budget for this stuff. So which would be the more impressive pitch for you?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, yeah. It's funny because I think like in many ways, like the way that like VCs make decisions, the way that like we think about deals is actually like super similar to some of the patterns that we observe with like neural networks. And that of course means that like we have bias. It also means that like we learn from patterns that we've observed. So I can give you the honest answer and then I can also give you the rational answer. The honest answer is that I would be more impressed by a company that has engaged with tech forward customers for the reasons that you described. Like in the past, we have generally seen that like tech will spread from the urban bees and Ubers and things of the world into the enterprise and not the other way around. We also have a bias that like these more traditional enterprises tend to move slower. There tends to be like a lot of bureaucratic red tape that you need to navigate. And like as such, those markets tend to be like less attractive. So on its face, like if you just said you don't have any additional information about like the velocity of sales, about like the quality of the tech or team, et cetera.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  But like you're holding the equal ideas. Yeah, equivalent. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So that said, I think like that is one of the biases that can cause us to make poor decisions. What really matters are some of the things that I just alluded to. Like if you're able to sell into insurance companies repeatedly and with high velocity, what is arguably like a better business than a company that spends six to 12 months trying to sell into tech companies? So it's less about like to whom do you sell and more about like is that a big market? Are you able to sell, you know, efficiently? Are you able to sell scalably? And I think like sometimes we need to be like aware of our biases and the impact that like marquee logos can have on our decision making.
