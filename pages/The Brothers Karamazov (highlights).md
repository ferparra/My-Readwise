document_note:: The Brothers Karamazov is an incredibly deep and captivating book which delves into the lives of the Karamzov brothers and their father Fyodor, who are all in love with the same woman, Grushenka. The book revolves around Dmitri being accused of killing his father over money and to have Grushenka to himself, but there are also many other subplots. The genius of this book lies in Dostoevsky's in-depth analysis of the characters and what they come to represent. It conveys the themes of faith vs doubt, free will as a burden, and the need to know and love oneself before loving God and others. These themes are exemplified by the character of Alyosha, who represents faith and Ivan, who represents doubt, and Zosima, whose great devotion and faith is not rewarded.
