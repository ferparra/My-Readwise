	- Socialized Mind (most adults): we have built relationships with our team  and those social connections influence our ideas the most.
	- Self-Authoring Mind (some adults): we shift from validating ourselves in the eyes of others to establishing an internal sense of self, and begin to direct ourselves independently.
	- Self-Transforming Mind (very few adults): weâ€™re able to balance both the perspectives of others with our our sense of self-direction.
