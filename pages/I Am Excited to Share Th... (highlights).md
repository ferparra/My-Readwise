	- I am excited to share that my thesis paper ‚ÄúPrefrontal Feature Representations Drive Memory Recall‚Äù is finally out in @Nature. Thanks to all my twitterless co-authors and my PhD advisor Dr. Priya Rajasethupathy. üßµ 1/10

	- In Yadav et al., we explored the mechanisms by which animals use individual cues (or features) to recall a memory. While global representations of memory are reported in hippocampus, the neural substrates that represent individual features are still unknown. 2/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/y_nakul/status/1547314059233599491))
	- We built a virtual reality based behavioral task where mice learned to associate multi-sensory contexts with reward or punishment, and later recalled these memories using partial contextual cues/features (cued recall).3/ https://t.co/3qHDWw4dlk ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/y_nakul/status/1547314089025847299))
	- Neural activity recordings from dorsal hippocampus (CA1) revealed neurons that respond selectively to context but not to individual features. So, where are features represented and used during recall? 4/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/y_nakul/status/1547314091848515584))
	- We suspected other regions with direct access to CA1 relay this feature information during cued recall. We focused on two regions with prominent inputs to CA1: Lateral Entorhinal Cortex (LEC) and Anterior Cingulate Cortex (AC). 5/

	- We found that silencing of AC (but not LEC) led to a preferential inhibition of context-selective neurons in CA1, and deficits in behavioral recall of the contextual memory. What is encoded in AC and routed to CA1 during behavioral recall? 6/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/y_nakul/status/1547314099134013441))
	- Imaging in AC revealed robust feature selective responses, in contrast to CA1. Moreover, preferential inhibition of just the feature neurons (but not a random population in AC) led to near complete deficit in cued recall. 7/

	- We were also able to record the activity of AC and CA1 simultaneously using a wide objective lens and dual GRIN implant approach, which enabled us to visualize dynamic re-organization across AC and CA1 during learning and retrieval, and also probe the effect of saliency. 8/ https://t.co/ewMrCH3il8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/y_nakul/status/1547314137457377280))
	- Together, our study uncovers parallel processing of features in AC that recruit episodic representations in CA1 to enable recall, that supports time-limited roles for entorhinal-CA1 during learning, and use of prefrontal circuits for subsequent retrieval and reorganization. 9/

	- Many thanks to everyone who helped us develop this study, and for insightful comments from Rajasethupathy/ Liston lab members, reviewers and colleagues at @RockefellerUniv and @WeillCornellGS @WeillCornell and the resource centers at both places. 10/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/y_nakul/status/1547314149360910337))
