	- Any project with either multiple or no clear owners jumps 10x in complexity. Examples: event tracking (eng? product? analytics?), data quality (data producers? data consumers?). Reducing complexity: split ownership into smaller pieces. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sarahmk125/status/1521813542491537412))

	- For event tracking, have one clear owner for each of (they can be the same or different people): event implementation, QA, stakeholder buy-in on metrics from events. For each of these areas, ownership extends forever to make sure there are no regressions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sarahmk125/status/1521814200582037505))
	- For data quality, split up ownership between: ongoing QA, response to failures. Someone should also own the relationship between data producers and consumers as it can be a complicated one. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sarahmk125/status/1521814508045582336))
	- For both, someone needs to own the PROCESS. Process surrounding QA and organizational buy in. This person keeps all owners accountable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sarahmk125/status/1521814738845712387))
