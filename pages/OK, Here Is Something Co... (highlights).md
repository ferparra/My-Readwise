	- OK, here is something cool: The lean theorem prover and it's tutorial deriving ℕ (natural numbers, that is integers >0) from the Paeno Axioms. I've just derived addition rules before breakfast and it's mostly because the tutorial is so damn good.

	- As one does when one has decided to learn mathematical reasoning on a whim…
	  
	  The problem of learning stuff when you do not have a university to back you up is getting feedback; all the info is there to look up, on yt and elsewhere, but how do you know you're on the right track? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dakoraa/status/1309404880734490624))
	- And that's so awesome about computerized systems; the compiler – or in this case the theorem prover – checks stuff for you. If lean says "Proof Achieved", you've done something right. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dakoraa/status/1309404882659663872))
	- It's of course not clear what you have achieved (and in the worst case you simply broke the theorem solver) but half of the cryptographic proofs I've red over the past month suffer from the same problem so… https://t.co/Uqp5HcjFDN ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dakoraa/status/1309404893954871296))
	- And if all else fails I can simply use hooman search (a variant on genetic programming in which the idiot in front of the computer supplies the randomization function which is usually equivalent to a randomized linear search) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dakoraa/status/1309404896920297473))
	- And I think I just finally started to properly understand induction that way (up till now I always thought it's kind of like recursion but weird¿?¿) https://t.co/f9DR6AvTJp ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dakoraa/status/1309404909176082432))
	- And honestly non-formal proofs have always seemed a bit to hand-wavy to me. Where did you take that theorem from? You just considered it a given?! And how did you check that proof? Seems logical?! srsly?!
	  
	  I've seen too many of my programs that seem logical go up in flames… https://t.co/iQeBLJOqyI ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dakoraa/status/1309406182336081920))
	- Kind of dissapointed not to have seen any follow up tutorials in the  style on ZFC, ZF, λ-calculus and Category Theory. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dakoraa/status/1309410432030060545))
