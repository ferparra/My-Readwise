	- Karl Popper and @DavidDeutschOxf are two of the greatest minds in philosophy.
	  
	  But it can be difficult to enter their world due to their breadth and depth. Thankfully @ToKTeacher did a Popper Primer and Deutsch Digest!
	  
	  ðŸ§µ Here are 4 ideas from Popper and 4 ideas from Deutsch ðŸ‘‡

		- **Note**: Thread
	- In just 4 minutes, you will get not only a strong philosophy of knowledge, but also a deep worldview.
	  
	  Because this is not just a random set of ideas. Deutsch built upon Popper's ideas. And all the following ideas are linked to each other. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663218773659649))
	- POPPER: IDEA #1
	  
	  We make progress by correcting errors in our ideas, rather than by trying to prove them right. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663221395087362))
	- Let's see what this means in science, the best error-correcting system.
	  
	  What makes an idea scientific?
	  
	  Traditional answers were:
	  â€¢ Deduced from axioms
	  â€¢ Induced by repeated observations
	  
	  But Popper gave a different answer... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663224016535552))
	- The difference between scientific and non-scientific ideas is testability. This is the famous falsification criterion. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663226730233856))
	- Testability allows us to correct errors by ruling out theories that do not match reality. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663229238431751))
	- Experiments do not provide us with the solution to our problems, but they do help rule out some of the potential solutions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663231767601153))
	- Contrary to popular belief, this does NOT mean that non-scientific ideas are worthless. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663234267406336))
	- POPPER IDEA #2
	  
	  To make progress, we are looking for the best ideas for our specific problems, not the last ideas. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663236767191040))
	- When we are searching for knowledge, we should not expect to find the ultimate truth, but the idea that solves a problem. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663239317344256))
	- We eliminate theories that don't survive criticism, and keep the best one. That is: the best one for a specific problem. Again, this is not the final theory to solve the problem. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663241871659008))
	- The ultimate truth is unattainable. We will always correct errors and make improvements to our understanding of the world. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663244438605826))
	- POPPER IDEA #3
	  
	  False dichotomies lurk everywhere. We should think of a third and better way. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663247009710080))
	- Example 1: epistemology
	  
	  â€¢ False dichotomy: either we have certainty in our knowledge (with induction for example) or we lack confidence.
	  â€¢ Solution: We should not seek certainty, but try to correct errors. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663249530462209))
	- Example 2: political system
	  
	  â€¢ False dichotomy: either we are ruled by a benevolent philosopher-King or by a majority.
	  â€¢ Solution: We should not answer "who should rule?", but "How can we remove bad leaders without violence?" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663252193869824))
	- POPPER IDEA #4
	  
	  Popper rejects authority (in all forms) as a source of knowledge. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663254790127616))
	- Induction does not give us access to "read the book of Nature".
	  
	  Government are not all-knowing entities to be trusted.
	  
	  Scientists should not be "believed", but questioned. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663257386422274))
	- Popper is therefore a defender of freedom and the right to criticize to weed out bad ideas. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663260083326979))
	- Now that we have discussed some of Popper's key ideas, let's explore how David Deutsch expanded upon these concepts to develop his own philosophical perspective. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663262708957185))
	- DEUTSCH #1
	  
	  Popper observed that testability separates science from the rest. Deutsch showed that it's not enough. To make progress, we need hard-to-vary explanations. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663265284296704))
	- Hard-to-vary means that the explanation cannot be easily changed without falling apart, because all of its details relate to the phenomenon it is explaining. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663267964452864))
	- For testability to even matters, the theory needs to be hard-to-vary.
	  
	  Otherwise, the easy-to-vary theory will just be changed slightly "to accommodate new evidence".
	  
	  This really means that it can never be disproven. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663270606860288))
	- DEUTSCH #2
	  
	  Popper thought that we made progress by correcting errors and creating knowledge.
	  
	  Deutsch takes that to its logical conclusion: unless prohibited by the laws of physics, the only limit to our progress is our lack of knowledge. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663273282797568))
	- So we have before us unbounded progress, as long as we continue to create knowledge. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663275874893824))
	- In particular, some explanations have infinite reach: they explain more than the problems they were created to solve (remember that Popper focused on problem-solution specificity), like General Relativity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663278387265536))
	- DEUTSCH #3
	  
	  Deutsch places human creativity at the heart of problem solving.
	  
	  We make progress not by choosing between 2 options, but by creating a third way. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663281088421889))
	- Our capacity to *create* explanatory knowledge is what makes us humans. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663283634372609))
	- Creating that knowledge enables us to change the world (and one day the Universe). Because we are only limited by our lack of knowledge and the laws of physics. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663286150922242))
	- Side note: that's the subtitle David Deutsch' book "The Beginning of Infinity": Explanations that transform the world. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663288755621888))
	- DEUTSCH #4
	  
	  Do not destroy the means of error correction. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663291280588800))
	- Societies that allow ideas to be criticized, and rejected or improved upon, will make progress. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663293818122243))
	- But societies that restrict debate and the free flow of ideas, will destroy the means of error correction.
	  
	  That's an error you really can't easily recover from. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663296355676161))
	- So morality and politics should be extremely mindful of not destroying the means of error correction (and therefore the source of all progress). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663298910003200))
	- CONCLUSION
	  
	  We make progress by correcting errors in our ideas. And the only limit to our progress is our lack of knowledge.
	  So we should never destroy the means of error correction.
	  
	  Testability differentiates science from the rest, but only if we have good explanations. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663301531459585))
	- False dichotomies are everywhere. Human creativity is at the heart of problem solving because we make progress not by choosing between 2 options, but by creating a third way.
	  
	  This is what makes humans special and is an antidote to nihilism. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1642663304140292097))
