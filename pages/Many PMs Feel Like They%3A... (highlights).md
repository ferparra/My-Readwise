	- Many PMs feel like they:
	  1. Have a lack of influence over the product strategy
	  2. Are stuck in a Feature factory, with a CEO/CPO or sales pushing solutions
	  3. Are overwhelmed by competing and shifting priorities, and need to fight fires constantly
	  
	  How do you deal with this? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/edo/status/1560929659297992705))
