	- 1/ Prediction: Everyone will soon be using foundation models (FMs) like GPT-4.
	  
	  However, they'll be using FMs trained on their own data & workloads:
	  
	  "GPT-You", not GPT-X
	  
	  Tl/dr:

	- @rishistyping @maxime_mlops @letsrebelagain And @letsrebelagain I wouldn't say that embedding/IR based approaches "solve" "hallucinations"- just the diff between getting a bad set of search results vs. a made up answer. Agree the former is better but neither solves it :). For that fine-tuned predictive models are needed! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ajratner/status/1643984816906575872))
