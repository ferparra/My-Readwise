	- 1/ Playtern Thoughts 💭 
	  
	  🧵 Arbitrum Ecosystem Mega Thread
	  
	  It has been over 2 weeks since @arbitrum One went live so I decided to do a deep dive 🔍 into the current Arbitrum landscape 🌄👇

	- 2/ 🌉 BRIDGES
	  
	  By now most of us are already familiar with how to bridge via https://t.co/eS6ymoIwG0
	  
	  👉 https://t.co/WtRSPm1ni9 to easily switch networks
	  👉 Straightforward bridging, bare bones UI
	  👉 7 day withdrawal period (similar to @0xPolygon plasma bridge)

	- 3/ For those looking to bypass the 7 day withdrawal period, @CelerNetwork has a bridge that you can access via https://t.co/b3w5lTlkIJ (bridging back takes about 15 mins)
	  
	  👉 Faster + Cheaper
	  👉 Uses WETH
	  👉 Currently can bridge from Arbitrum to (ETH, BSC, MATIC, FTM, and AVAX)

	- 4/ @HopProtocol also announced their bridge which allows one to bridge directly from @arbitrum to @optimismPBC 
	  
	  👉 Other supported networks are: ETH, MATIC, and xDAI
	  👉 Currently only allows the sending of USDC, USDT and MATIC

	- 5/ Amount of Bridged ETH to Arbitrum
	  
	  In the past 2 weeks, the amount of ETH that has been bridged over to @arbitrum has continued to increase 
	  
	  +2014% in the past 7 days with about 660k ETH bridged

	- 6/ So what caused this surge of inflows?
	  
	  Initially, I believe this could be attributed to the crazily high yields of pool 0 "risk-free" yield farms that sprung up on @arbitrum
	  
	  Another is perhaps users anticipating an airdrop similar to that of the $GB airdrop for AVAX bridgers https://t.co/kolUiQ6rQn ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/playtern/status/1439224043131977728))
	- 7/ Of course the speed and low tx costs on L2 (👇 10-12x) are a big factor as users look forward to seeing their favorite ETH applications migrate over to @arbitrum
	  
	  PS: Fees are bound to get even 🔻 cheaper when throttling is finally turned off

	- 25/ Speaking of airdrops, @GMArbitrum is actually going to conduct an airdrop for anyone who used the @arbitrum bridge and bridged over at least 0.2 ETH and there's also going to be an NFT airdrop for the first 500 users who answer their form

	- 28/ Despite the numerous meme farms that came about after @arbitrum One went live, the Arbitrum landscape is starting to take shape and blossom with new and interesting projects that take full advantage of L2 https://t.co/ErNVlUrl65 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/playtern/status/1439224115395629056))
	- 29/ With the many LM programs taking place in different sub-ecosystems, a lot of the bridged ETH that was sitting on the sidelines is now beginning to find it's way into these protocols
	  
	  It truly is a yield farmer's dream come true 👩‍🌾🌟

	- 30/ There's no clear winner for now but it will be interesting to see how each application strives for market share in this very competitive L2 sphere https://t.co/ehpTZMOzNJ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/playtern/status/1439224125772353551))
	- 31/ A 🔑 takeaway from observing the liquidity mining programs of $AVAX, $FTM, $CELO, $MATIC, etc is that native applications tend to perform better due to their ability to better incentivize TVL via aggressive LM Programs as compared to their larger, more distributed competitors https://t.co/ZX7vYPaztH ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/playtern/status/1439224129383649283))
