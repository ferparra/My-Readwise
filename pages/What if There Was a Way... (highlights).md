	- What if there was a way to:
	  • Mitigate climate change
	  • Create more life
	  • Grow the economy
	  • And make money along the way?
	  
	  Let's call it *Seaflooding*

	- The Mediterranean used to be a dry, salty, inhospitable hellhole before the Zanclean Megaflood
	  
	  Thanks to that flood, we have a wonderful sea. Life, trade, and the economy have thrived on its shores for thousands of years
	  
	  What if we replicated that?

	- We know what would happen:
	  
	  Fill a dead depression with seawater
	  With more moisture, rains follow
	  Desert flowers blossom
	  As water accumulates, early on it turns pink

	- Then it turns blue and green
	  Plants appear
	  Animals appear
	  An economy follows
	  
	  Where can we do this?

	- There are many hellholes on Earth that look exactly like the Med when it was dry:
	  • Below sea level
	  • So high pressure
	  • Very hot
	  • Very dry
	  • They concentrate salts brought by rivers that die in these hellholes
	  
	  You probably think of one already: the Dead Sea

	- It's 200-600m below sea level and there's not much there: some salt harvesting, a bit of tourism... It's mostly a desert

	- You could bring water from the sea and flood it. This would mean:
	  • Electricity generation, given the huge depression
	  • Which could be used for desalination. Fresh water. Irrigation. More life.
	  • The area would get more moisture, with more plants & animals
	  • More tourism

	- So why don't we do it? Well, we want to!
	  
	  Jordan had the Red-Dead Water Conveyance project, bringing water from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea.
	  
	  But they shelved it just a few years ago.
	  Why?
	  It's on the border with Israel, but Israel didn't show much interest.
	  Why?

	- Because Israel had its own plan! The Med-Dead Canal would benefit from a shorter distance for the pipelines, along with a lower mountain range to go through
	  
	  But Jordan is wary of more dependence on Israel
	  And this would have to go through the West Bank
	  ➡️Nothing gets done

	- What if there was a similar hellhole that doesn't depend on any other country? There is! Let's just travel a few hundreds of km to neighboring Egypt and its Qattara Depression

	- The Qattara Depression sits in the middle of nothing, in the Sahara.
	  Sand, salt, and sorrow.

	- The Egyptian gov had the idea of seaflooding it
	  This would have the additional benefits of:
	  No international discussions
	  A much bigger surface
	  In a much more desertic & desolate region
	  It would reduce ocean levels by 3mm
	  And 6% of global warming-induced sea level increases

	- Not only that, but it would dramatically reduce Egypt's food scarcity—and hence political instability
	  
	  Ecological impact studies have been carried out, finding no real downside. There are few local animals, they can be displaced, and + animals would come
	  
	  Egypt should do it!

	- Also, follow me for more threads like this ~once a week
	  
	  Where else can we do this? There's a bunch of places below sea level. One of them is a no-brainer to me, and it's in the US
	  
	  I'll discuss it—and some others—in this week's premium article

	- I see a lot of ppl think this is a good idea. So share it!
	  
	  The more ppl know, the more they'll share. Soon, it will be common knowledge and governments will take action.
	  
	  So RT the top tweet if you want to push the idea:
