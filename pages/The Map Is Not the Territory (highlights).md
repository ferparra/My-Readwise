	- The map of reality is not reality. Even the best maps are imperfect. That’s because they are reductions of what they represent. If a map were to represent the territory with perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction and thus would no longer be useful to us.

	- “The map appears to us more real than the land.”

	- “(History) offers a ridiculous spectacle of a fragment expounding the whole.”

	- A model might show you some risks, but not the risks of using it. Moreover, models are built on a finite set of parameters, while reality affords us infinite sources of risks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gndhn3e70rv56vrtw75fnwdy))
	- I find that those professional risk managers whom I heard recommend a “guarded” use of the VAR on grounds that it “generally works” or “it works on average” do not share my definition of risk management. The risk management objective function is survival, not profits and losses. A trader according to the Chicago legend, “made 8 million in eight years and lost 80 million in eight minutes”. According to the same standards, he would be, “in general”, and “on average” a good risk manager. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gndhqagp1b5h057p60qc9w8a))
