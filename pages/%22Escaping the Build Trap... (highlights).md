- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 18th, 2022]]
	- When you don't understand your customers' problems, "quantity of features delivered" is a bad proxy of value.
	  
	  Only by doing the work to understand your customers can true value be defined.

	- Know the outcomes you seek.
	  
	  Every feature you build should result in some outcome that is tied back to business value: money, data, knowledge capital, or promotion.
	- Commit not to solutions but to the outcomes these solutions produce.
	  
	  Change tactics and kill ideas accordingly.
	- Great product managers are idea terminators rather than idea generators.
	  
	  They understand that the fundamental criterion for building a product is that it solves a problem for a user.
	- Great product managers push back.
	  
	  Customers want their problems solved.
	  Leaders want to hit their goals.
	  Pushing back is essential to building a successful product.

	- Great product managers make sure the product being created achieves the goals of the customer and business.
	  
	  But they know the team collectively owns the product.

	- Great product managers talk more passionately about the problems the team is solving than the solutions they are shipping.
	  
	  Solving the wrong problem will get you nowhere.

	- Always focus on the problem.
	  
	  If you anchor yourself with the "why", you will be more likely to build the right thing.
	- Problem and solution exploration is risk mitigation.
	  
	  It is better to fail in smaller ways earlier, and to learn what will succeed, rather than spending all the time and money failing in a publicly large way.

	- The opportunity cost of building the wrong thing is too high.
	  
	  Solution exploration is about getting faster feedback. Learning reduces risk.
	- Don't confuse "building to learn" and "building to earn".
	  
	  Experimentation is all about learning, so you can eventually earn.

	- An MVP is "the minimum amount of effort to learn", anchoring you on outcomes rather than outputs.
	- The Product Kata:
	- A good strategy is not a plan; it's a framework that helps you make decisions.
	  
	  If you change your strategy yearly or monthly, without good reason from data or the market, you are treating your strategy as a plan rather than as a framework.

	- Product management is not project management.
	  
	  Products are vehicles of value. They deliver value repeatedly to customers and users without requiring the company to build something new every time.

	- Proactively kill bad ideas.
	  
	  The fewer features, the better. Reduce product complexity. It's about quality, not quantity. Don't exhaust your users.
	- Scrum can be helpful but doesn't answer:
		- **Tags**: #[[favorite]]
	- Product management and Scrum can work well together, but product management is not dependent on Scrum.
	- Keep strategy and value execution together.
	  
	  Only then can the work happening in the teams be evaluated to make sure it's essential to achieving the strategy.

	- The unconstrained team is the most frightened and scared to act. They cannot make a decision because there are too many options.
	  
	  Appropriately constrained teams can see how their stories align to the goals of the org.

	- Lack of leadership alignment is by far the biggest issue standing in the way of successful product management.
	  
	  When strategy is communicated well in an organization, product development and management are synchronized.

	- Visibility is key.
	  
	  The more leaders can understand where teams are, the more likely they will step back and let teams execute.
	- If you're aligned coherently and have a good strategic framework, you can allow people to make decisions without minimum management oversight.

	- Process and frameworks matter, but only get you so far.
	  
	  Culture, policies and structure are the things that really set a company apart to thrive in product management.

	- Reward people for learning and achieving goals, not for delivering features.
