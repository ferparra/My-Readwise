	- I used to joke that Data Scientists exist not to uncover insights or provide analysis, but merely to provide factoids that confirm senior management's prior beliefs.
	  
	  I did several experiments, and noticed that whenever I produced analysis that was in line with what management expected - my analysis was praised and widely disseminated. Nobody would even question data completeness, quality, whatever. They would pick some flashy metric like a percentage and run around with it.
	  
	  Whenever my analysis contradicted - there was so much scrutiny in numbers, data quality, etc, and even after answering all questions and concerns - analysis would be tossed away as non-actionable/useless/etc.
	  
	  if you want to succeed as a Data Scientist and be praised by management - you got to provide data analysis that supports managements ideas (however wrong or ineffective they might be).
	  
	  Data Scientist's job is to launder management's intuition using quantitative methods :) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grq65c3n4waz7fgf6bnybhvt))
	- I've made anecdotal observations similiar to this over the last 10 years. I work in AgTech. A big push for a while here has been "more and more more data". Sensor-the-heck out of your farm, and We'll Tell You Things(tm).
	  
	  Most of what we as an industry are able to tell growers is stuff they already know or suspect. There is the occasional suprise or "Aha" moment where some correlation becomes apparent, but the thing about these is that once they've been observed and understood, the value of ongoing observation drops rapidly.
	  
	  A great example of this is soil moisture sensors. Every farmer that puts these in goes geek-crazy for the first year or so. It's so cool to see charts that illustrate the effect of their irrigation efforts. They may even learn a little and make some adjustments. But once those adjustments and knowledge have been applied, it's not like they really need this ongoing telementry as much anymore. They'll check periodically (maybe) to continue to validate their new assumptions, but 3 years later, the probes are often forgotten and left to rot, or reduced in count.
