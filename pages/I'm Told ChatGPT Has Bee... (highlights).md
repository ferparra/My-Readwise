	- I'm told ChatGPT has been upgraded to be able to solve math problems and that is it the future of math tutoring. But my hit rate is ~0 so far... and I wasn't even trying trick questions.
	  
	  Not dissing the system at all -- just a PSA.

	- "Can an even number be prime?"
	  
	  "No"
	  
	  "So can this 22-digit even number be prime?"
	  
	  "The number is even and has over 50 digits, it's it's highly unlikely to be prime. While it is possible that the number is prime, ..." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1620871059879919616))
	- The gap between generating words and generating meaning will prove hard to close. Generating meaning requires *a model of the things being talked about* (language as communication), while generating words only requires a model of the structure of text (language as statistics) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1620871312221835264))
	- 12 year olds typing their math homework into ChatGPT are in for a world of confusion

	- Funnily enough that question was provided to me by ChatGPT itself as an example of a reasoning question ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1621701804538068995))
	- Naturally it will give you different answers depending on how you prime it. But for this question it trends towards "isosceles". Equilateral is definitely out. When providing the right answer, the justification is a bit curious (it's not isosceles as only 2 sides are equal??)

	- Again no tricks here. This is not a particularly selected result either. It's impossible not to run into this pattern after 1-2 questions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1621703961966411776))
	- I still think the best application of ChatGPT so far is generating songs/poems for fun. It's really great at that (I wonder if it has been explicitly fine-tuned for it?) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1621703962834636802))
