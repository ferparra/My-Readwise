	- Sauna use mimics physiological and protective responses induced during exercise.
	- Repeated sauna use optimizes stress responses via hormesis and heat shock proteins.
	- Sauna use appears to reduce morbidity and mortality in a dose-dependent manner.
	- Frequent sauna use may protect against cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease.
	- Sauna use provides a means of preserving muscle mass and countering sarcopenia.
	- One of the protective adaptive responses to heat stress is the increased expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). Heat-shock proteins comprise a large, highly conserved family of proteins that are present in all cells.
