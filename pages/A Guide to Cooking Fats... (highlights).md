		- **Note**: Thread
	- To start, let’s clear up a little misconception.
	  
	  Many people think that the smoke point of a fat is an indicator of how safe it is under heat, but this isn’t the case.
	  
	  Smoke point is a POOR indicator of how well a fat does under heat. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1559236648256290816))
	- What matters is the STABILITY of the fat, and there are 3 main factors to consider:
	  
	  1. Composition
	  
	  -Saturated fats (no double bonds, stable at heat)
	  -Monounsaturated fats (1 double bond, stable at heat)
	  -Polyunsaturated fats (2 or more double bonds, not stable at heat) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1559236649661366272))
	- 2. Antioxidants
	  
	  Antioxidants protect against oxidation, which is the undesirable process that can happen to an oil when exposed to heat. 
	  
	  Therefore, antioxidants play a major role in the stability and health benefits of an oil. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1559236651297243136))
	- 3. Level of refinement
	  
	  The more refined oils are, the lower the oxidative stability is. This is because they are exposed to high heat, and the natural antioxidants are stripped away. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1559236657643143168))
	- Seed oils fail the test for all 3; they are polyunsaturated fats, have extremely low antioxidants, and very high level of refinement. 
	  
	  However, the temperature at which this happens is unrelated to the smoke point! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1559236659010572289))
	- The smoke point may, however, alter the flavor, but I will get into that later. Let’s get started. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1559236660444921857))
	- BUTTER
	  
	  Because butter is mainly a saturated fat, it is stable at heat. It does have a low smoke point at 350 degrees, which means the flavor can be impacted rather quickly. 
	  
	  Butter is perfect for low to medium low heat cooking, baking or finishing a steak/meat with. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1559236661921415170))
	- Compared to regular butter, grass fed butter contains:
	  
	  -more Vitamin A
	  -more Vitamin K2
	  -Up to 5 times more CLA
	  -Up to 25% more Omega 3’s
	  -Tastes way better ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1559236663389331459))
	- GHEE
	  
	  Ghee is also mainly a saturated fat, making it stable at heat. It has a much higher smoke point than butter at 480 degrees, making it the best option for high heat when you want the butter flavor.
	  
	  This is a great option for searing a steak, or other high heat cooking. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1559236664928747521))
	- COCONUT OIL
	  
	  Coconut oil is very high in saturated fat, making it very stable at high heat. Although it does have a low smoke point of 350 degrees, this does not have a huge impact on the flavor.
	  
	  Coconut oil is great for searing, frying, and sautéing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coookwithchris/status/1559236667407474690))
