	- REAL TALK 🚨
	  
	  If you’re like most devs, you don’t write SQL. Instead you write less efficient & less maintainable data processing code in JS/Python/etc.
	  
	  You miss out on the real power of your database. 
	  
	  Why? Because SQL is mysterious & you don't know what it can do for you.

	- SQL is hard. 😤
	  
	  Why? Because it’s declarative, not imperative. You have to say “this is the result I want” instead of “follow these steps”.
	  
	  That makes it feel unfamiliar to most devs.
	  
	  And without experience, this unfamiliar approach makes SQL hard to write and reason about. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/benbarbersmith/status/1370058343482548228))
	- Writing SQL as a beginner is a mindfuck. 
	  
	  Something you’d solve with a simple for loop can require mind-bending queries.
	  
	  Working primarily with columns of data instead of arrays of objects changes the way you need to think. 
	  
	  You can't just solve problems by adding more code. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/benbarbersmith/status/1370058344577302529))
	- Worse: there's a performance penalty that gets applied if you phrase your request ("this is the result I want") in the wrong way.
	  
	  It's not enough to know the syntax of SQL. Just like JS, PHP, Ruby & Python, the syntax is just the beginning. You need the fundamentals, too. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/benbarbersmith/status/1370058345508397063))
	- Unfortunately, most of us (me included!) started off with ORMs or other database abstraction layers. You write models and the libraries just handle the database and generate SQL for you.
	  
	  But when things go wrong or you need more power, that makes it even more indecipherable! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/benbarbersmith/status/1370058346334666768))
	- We end up trying to learn SQL when we hit the limitations of our abstraction layer.
	  
	  Then we have to reason about the libraries AND our database tables AND our queries at the same time. And we didn't even write the tables or queries to begin with! 😱
	  
	  No wonder we fear SQL. 😞 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/benbarbersmith/status/1370058347462934528))
	- On top of that, there are a million things you already know how to do in JS (etc.), but you don't know how to do in SQL.
	  
	  Things like:
	  
	  • functions or macros
	  • triggers (kinda like webhooks)
	  • migrations (kinda like versioning)
	  
	  So you don't use them. And you’re missing out. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/benbarbersmith/status/1370058348444459010))
	- Besides, so much about SQL & database performance is straight-up mysterious.
	  
	  How do migrations work? What do foreign keys actually do? Why is this join slow? When will deletes cascade? What is a materialized view for? What are the different flavors of SQL used by different DBs? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/benbarbersmith/status/1370058349337804803))
	- But this stuff can be taught & learned!
	  
	  Nobody starts with a deep understanding of SQL, but you CAN acquire it.
	  
	  And that will stop you from fearing it...
	  
	  And that will make you a ton more productive in the future!
	  
	  I'm serious. Grokking SQL lets you ship faster. 🚢 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/benbarbersmith/status/1370058350235418625))
	- Why is knowing SQL so valuable?
	  
	  Once you get it, you can:
	  
	  • write more concise data-crunching code
	  • benefit from the insanely optimized performance that databases offer
	  • use your chosen ORMs & database abstractions without fear, knowing how they work under the hood
	  
	  (cont) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/benbarbersmith/status/1370058351179091971))
	- You can:
	  
	  • write code that can be re-used by anything that touches the DB
	  • write queries for analytics platforms, data warehouses, etc.
	  • easily answer ad-hoc questions about user behaviour
	  • solve data issues introduced by backend/frontend bugs without hacky patches

	- Ok, let's wrap this mega-thread up.
	  
	  Stop me if this sounds like you:
	  
	  • Uses a database
	  • Wants to ship fast
	  • Doesn't like writing SQL
	  • Uses an ORM
	  • Fears poor DB performance
	  
	  Yeah. Me too, 7 years ago. But then I learned all about SQL at Google. Now I want to teach YOU. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/benbarbersmith/status/1370058353175592965))
