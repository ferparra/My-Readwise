	- elephant in the room:
	  
	  flashbot bundles that pay miners via contracts will significantly undermine eip-1559 https://t.co/dSbG5f7jv4 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1400415143155191808))

	- why?
	  
	  reward from 1 flashbot tx > including transactions that exceed the block size limit 
	  
	  flashbot tx can enforce that with low tx fee... (e.g. it'll become invalidated if you increase base fee over time). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1400415321836736521))
	- Paying miners via contracts & the base fee combined can become a strong incentivise for miners to self-limit the size of blocks (to keep base fee low).
	  
	  Plus, EIP-1559 relies on miners who cannot coordinate, but we know 85% hashrate is signed up to flashbots.
	  
	  They can coordinate ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1400415950785204228))
	- Bitcoin does not get off scot-free either. It shares the same proof of work consensus protocol as Ethereum. 
	  
	  Security of the network assumes miners cannot co-ordinate. Ethereum is starting to show they can when there is a financial incentive too. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1400416187968897036))
