	- I asked chatgpt to generate an .obj file of a tetrahedron. It generated a list of vertices/faces in the .obj format. If you paste that into an empty file, it will open up in a 3D viewer, like meshlab! (It's even topologically correct: manifold, correct face normals, etc)  1/ https://t.co/1bCyKLcTl4 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RanaHanocka/status/1606467546827440129))

	- Here is the chatgpt response. Chatgpt seems to be able to generate .objs for simple stuff, but the geometry starts to break down for more complicated requests. Still, I think this shows promise for a 3D model creation through a natural conversation! 2/
