	- The questions worth asking are things like:
	  
	  Why does no one feel they have enough time? Have we complicated life too much for the average person? How?
	  
	  Why does no one feel they have enough motivation? (Not just for babies, but for lots of other things that come before them.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1390357416542445576))
	- save money, take risks, find hobbies, make things, make friends, make babies, make art. Realize the world is very small. Live life as a perpetual regeneration of your inexhaustible fruitfulness as you act upon the world around you. https://t.co/pqzeAvoulD ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1388202460158873604))
	- People take too few risks, especially asymmetric risks, but most of all they leave too little room for surprise. Leave room for little bets, little detours, little discoveries, little well-wishings, little letters. Leave a little accommodation for things you do not yet understand ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1367923836428156930))
	- The clearest way to build relationships, every kind of relationship for that matter, is to do work together.
	  
	  Build something, take pottery classes, volunteer, try traveling somewhere unknown, all together, and you'll get an idea. You'll also grow together. https://t.co/gFfsXkDitT ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1451605998758678528))
