	- Rayleigh's criterion: two point sources viewed thru an aperture are ‘just’ resolved when the maximum of the Airy disk (PSF) of one source falls on the first minimum of the PSF of the other
	  
	  This idea is often mistaken for a physical law — it is not. It’s just a rule of thumb

	- Rayleigh's criterion just says we can't ‘eyeball’ two sources if they're too close. But this doesn't mean we can't *detect* the presence of two sources; even in the presence of noise. With proper statistical tests we can find very weak signals fully hidden to the naked eye.

	- Here’s the punchline:
	  
	  A power law describes the required SNR to detect two equally bright sources a distance d apart. Namely, the required SNR is inversely proportional to d⁴ and the number N of samples. c is a function of detection error tolerances: 
	  
	  SNR = c/Nd⁴

	- This relationship & its generalizations have been (re)discovered many times. Yet it is surprisingly little known. Our work from 2006 doesn’t have a ton of citations but the one it has are very diverse …black holes, gravity waves, neuron spikes, microscopy, math, etc
