	- Magic Realm epic review – Magic Realm is a game steeped in nostalgia for me. The game is common considered one of the most complicated (and fiddly) tabletop board games ever devised. While that may be true to a degree, learning the game is helped by knowing someone who already knows the game to teach you. The Anomalous Host attempts to be that person for the world and while jumping in to the game may still require effort, they do a great job of spreading the joy of Magic Realm.
	- The ‘Shamanification’ of the Tech CEO – This post may have the grossest string of English words to ever have been concatenated. That said, Manvir Singh does a good job of sketching the techniques that modern tech CEOs use to project an otherness and an outsider nature in similar ways to the shamans of past. Singh’s research on shamanism is fascinating and he’s very vocal about what he’s looking at and thinking about. and is well-worth a follow.
	- ZX81 Goes Nuclear – Controlling a Nuclear Power Plant – John Newcombe runs through the retro use of the ZX81 as the control center for a nuclear power plant, and even emulates the power plant! A chunk of Uranium-238 makes a surprise appearance.
	- The Eeriness of the English Countryside – Robert Macfarlane does a masterful job of expressing the motivating forces of the English countryside on the great works of the weird and eerie.
	- The “Compulator” Book Building Super Calculators & Mini Computer Hardware With Calculator Chips by Robert Haviland – A shining example of a “Compulator” is the HP 9100A which was loved by Woz and possibly the first personal computer. The book touches on this interesting branch on the history of computing by discussing, at a very high level, the architectures of such machines.
