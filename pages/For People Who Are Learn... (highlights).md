	- For people who are learning prompt engineering to leverage powerful large language models (LLM) like ChatGPT, use the the "genius in a room" mental model when crafting your questions/prompts.

	- Imagine you live next door to a genius (or at least a very smart friend who reads a ton, up until 2021) and the only way you can communicate with him/her is to slide a piece of paper under the door and ask for a reply. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JessicaShieh/status/1622393243202891776))
	- This genius in the room does not have any context on you nor the problems you trying to solve. 
	  
	  He/She can't see your face, doesn't know where you are, cannot read your emotions, doesn't have the unique knowledge you have and has no idea what you are trying to do. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JessicaShieh/status/1622393244234715144))
	- The genius only accepts questions when they are written on a piece of paper and slipped underneath the door. 
	  
	  Given that, how would you write your prompts differently? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JessicaShieh/status/1622393245287456769))
	- With this "genius in the room" mental model, you now know - context is key.
	  
	  Providing the right context can have a huge impact on the quality of the output as you perceived it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JessicaShieh/status/1622393246260555776))
	- Some best practices: 
	  • Explain the problem you want the model to solve 
	  • Articulate the output you want - in what format (" answer in a bulleted list"), in what tone/style ("answer the question as a patient math teacher...")
	  • Provide the unique knowledge needed for the task ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JessicaShieh/status/1622393247292334080))

	  • breakdown complex tasks 
	  • explain before answering 
	  • few shots
	  • chain-of-thoughts prompting
	  
	  Huge kudos to @sandersted for the guide and for sharing this mental model. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JessicaShieh/status/1622393248303173633))
	- When writing prompts, a good question to ask yourself is: "if I gave this prompt to a college-level intern I just hired, will he/she be able to complete the task based on the instruction and information provided?"
	  
	  If the answer is no, re-write your prompt until you get a "yes". ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JessicaShieh/status/1622393249985069056))
	- That's it!
	  
	  TL;DR
	  • Write your prompt as if you are communicating with a "genius in a room"
	  • Sanity-check by asking "is the prompt so clear an intern can complete the task"
	  • Context is key ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JessicaShieh/status/1622393250995916801))
