	- Every Sunday (so like 60% of Sundays) I have a little ritual where I check in to make sure I'm on the right path.

	- It means that for every 1 degree a plane veers off its course, it misses its target destination by 1 mile for every 60 miles you fly. 
	  
	  Further you go, further away from your goal you get.

	- So how do you make sure you're even on the right path? 
	  
	  You grab yourself a nice big glass of red.
	  You sit down to some music (I like instrumental).
	  You open your computer.
	  And you ask yourself some questions. 
	  
	  These are mine. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1507817466436665348))

	- What would I do if no one was watching and success was inevitable in it? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1507817470178041857))
	- What would I NOT do if I knew for sure it would fail? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1507817472451297293))
	- What would I do EVEN if I knew it was going to fail. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1507817474011582473))
	- What am I doing right now because I think I SHOULD do it? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1507817475731247111))
	- Looking back at last week how much of my day was spent doing things I actively enjoyed?
	  
	  How'd that compare to the week before? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1507817483176136708))
	- Then throw all those answers and questions in Evernote and see how you progress.
	  
	  It turns out it's a lot harder to get lost when you're constantly looking at the map. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1507817484803575811))
