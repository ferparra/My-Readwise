	- Often asked how to use Twitter
	  
	  I have 4 principles 
	  
	  1) Aspire to be interested, not interesting (Im boring & unskilled!)
	  2) Make online friends
	  3) Curate the curators. They help discover info, POVs, people, convos
	  4) Be comfortable with being the dumb person all the time ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/search?q=Often%20asked%20how%20to%20use%20Twitter%20%20I%20have%204%20principles%20%20%201%29%20Aspire%20to%20be%20interested%2C%20not%20interesting%20%28Im%20boring%20%26%20unskilled%21%29%202%29%20Make%20online%20friends%203%29%20Curate%20the%20curators.%20They%20help%20discover%20info%2C%20POVs%2C%20people%2C%20convos%204%29%20Be%20comfortable%20with%20b%20%28from%3A%40sarthakgh%29))
