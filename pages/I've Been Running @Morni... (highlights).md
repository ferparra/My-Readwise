	- 1/ Hijack a super-powered timeline
	  
	  turn on post notifications for someone big in your niche. For MB that person is @elonmusk
	  
	  each time they tweet, be one of the first to respond 
	  
	  this interaction below got 300K+ impressions https://t.co/ImRk6emOuT
	- 2/ Double down on "voice" in comments section
	  
	  MB has a very specific voice
	  
	  on twitter, i wanted to turn that voice up a couple of notches 
	  
	  in twitter responses i turned it up even more 
	  
	  this thread was unfiltered MB at its best

	- 3/ When it comes to memes, invest in tools
	  
	  memes look hastily assembled by nature but the right software helps a lot
	  
	  for videos: https://t.co/P1m1JuKn4O
	  
	  for pics: Adobe photoshop
	  
	  for inspiration: always be looking, always be borrowing
	- 4/ Always be borrowing
	  
	  i follow video aggregator accounts like @30SECVIDEOS and @RexChapman
	  
	  i pull videos from their accounts and caption it to make it relevant to the MB audience
	  
	  ex: https://t.co/04PMz2N2eT
	- 5/ Interact with power followers
	  
	  I know @JJWatt is a fan of the Brew.
	  
	   during #thematch i made sure to monitor his tweets to see if i could interact with him
	  
	  got a RT and tons of exposure https://t.co/gCBqusE6yF
	- 6/ Never use emojis
	  
	  just don't. 
	  
	  they never make a tweet better and almost always make it worse
	  
	  plus the data backs it up: only 2 of our top 25 tweets contained emojis
	- 8/ Build a community
	  
	  the easiest way to do that is to create a visual identity
	  
	  @andrewyang did this with the üß¢
	  
	  im working on doing this with the "‚òïÔ∏è"
	  
	  when you run into another ‚òïÔ∏è on twitter, you know they read the Brew. 
	  
	  community=built https://t.co/C4MZ0Cgh4X
	- 9/ When it comes to the hard stuff, be genuine
	  
	  im inexperienced handling important topics like the BLM protests
	  
	  so i leaned heavily on @MorningBrew leadership for guidance
	  
	  there is no right answer so we just did what felt truest to what we believed in as a company
	- 10/ Go super viral
	  
	  there's no secret sauce 
	  
	  just throw enough darts
	  
	  without as much accuracy as you can muster
	  
	  and eventually you'll hit the bullseye
	  
	  bullseye=1 million impressions
