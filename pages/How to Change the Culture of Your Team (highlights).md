	- As SEOMoz founder Rand Fishkin writes:
	  If you're trying to figure out what a company's values really are, look at the decisions management makes when lots of money, risk, or loss of face for executives is at odds with the stated values. Want to know the company's mission & vision? Look at what they've intentionally chosen not to do, even though it could be lucrative.
	- As Linkedin CEO, Jeff Weiner, said in an interview,
	  "A friend of mine once paraphrased David Gergen, saying on the subject of repetition, "If you want to get your point across, especially to a broader audience, you need to repeat yourself so often, you get sick of hearing yourself say it. And only then will people begin to internalize what you're saying."
	- the CEO of Grove, introduced the value of "Eat the Frog" at a Monday morning all-hands team standup.  He explained it to their team, which came from author Brain Tracy as follows:
	  Mark Twain once said that if the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that that is probably the worst thing that is going to happen to you all day long. Your "frog” is your biggest, most important task, the one you are most likely to procrastinate on if you don't do something about it.
