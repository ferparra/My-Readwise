	- The Future of Fusion Energy is the best introduction to fusion that I know. I can confirm that the information it contains is common knowledge among plasma physicists.
	- Fusion involves ‘burning' lighter elements to make heavier elements.
	- Multiply these three quantities, density, temperature, and confinement time [6], to get the plasma triple product. Lawson's criterion states that, if the triple product is high enough, then you will get fusion.

	- Fusion occurs at such high temperatures that everything is ionized: The electrons and nuclei cannot stick together as atoms and instead move independently. Matter in this state is called a ‘plasma' [8]. Plasma is by far the most common state of matter in the universe. Stars are made of plasma, as well as the low density matter in the space between stars. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkzwdcp1bqzse5kqpj98fwr9))
	- How do we bottle the core of the sun?
	  
	  With a magnetic field. The electrons and ions in a fusion plasma are charged. Charged particles spiral around magnetic field lines and will not move freely perpendicular to the magnetic field. This confines the plasma in two dimensions. To confine the plasma in the third dimension, loop the magnetic field around in the shape of a doughnut [9]. The particles can move around the doughnut, but stay confined within it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkzwehbq0x3fjg9pam060h69))

	- The magnetic field can be created by superconducting electromagnetic coils which go around and through the doughnut. Turning on the coils provides some initial heating and current, but to sustain it, you need to inject accelerated particles or waves from the side.
	  
	  This kind of fusion experiment is called a tokamak ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkzwg193aadcmq6gpt4x4ft5))

	- The larger the experiment, the farther the particles have to move (perpendicular to the magnetic field) to get from the core to the outer edge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkzwthak52k0y8ca3tf9faf4))
	- Small fusion experiments are sometimes called ‘tabletop' experiments. This doesn't always mean that they fit on a tabletop, but they can fit in the physics building of a research university without too much disruption. The doughnut has a radius of about 1 m. The support requirements (power supply, control systems, measuring equipment, etc.) aren't too different from other physics labs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkzwty71scmfxhysrpkr6t9g))
	- Medium fusion experiments have a radius of about 1.5 - 3 m. They require their own facility for all of their support systems, but they typically fit in a single building. One prominent medium experiment is JET [11]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkzwv960yfqdrnef5ynm670x))
	- Large fusion experiment means ITER [12], an experiment currently under construction in southern France. ITER has a diameter of over 6 meters. The experiment itself has a five story building. Supporting buildings cover about 100 acres or 0.5 km2. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkzwvc2fp0bwjjfzxx6vaqn4))
	- The reason why progress has stalled is because we did as much as we could do on medium experiments. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkzwvvq98csjmwff98mpebhf))

	- Recent advances in high temperature superconductors have been a game changer. They can produce a much stronger magnetic field which allows for better confinement in a smaller experiment. We should now be able to get Q=10 in a medium experiment, which costs ten times less than ITER [18] and is within the reach of private venture capital.

	- The main benefit of stellarators is that they don't have disruptions. Disruptions are caused by the current in the plasma. If the plasma is already moving coherently, when things become unstable, that motion can be redirected into the wall. The plasma in a stellarator doesn't have a current and isn't moving. When it becomes unstable, it leaks heat slightly faster than normal until it cools down again. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkzx1fwe5g4vm5jt5wb44f2j))

	- Start with a small pellet [20] which contains deuterium and tritium. Shine lots of lasers on it from all directions. For a moment, the pellet receives 1,000 times as much power as the entire US and implodes. The deuterium and tritium briefly become hot and dense enough to get fusion, before expanding again.
