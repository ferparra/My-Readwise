	- [[Pharmacology]] & [[Focus]]: I take 300mg of [[Alpha-GPC]] 3-5X a week (usually with an espresso) before doing [[deep work]]. I started a while ago b/c a (Nobel Prize winning) colleague told me he uses [[nicotine]] gum 3-4X/day (?!) to enhance his focus. Alpha-GPC is a milder nicotinic agent.

	- Some people don’t need any tools of this kind. I do favor behavioral tools for focus (e.g., 5-10min of meditation daily is known to increase focus). That said, there are good non Rx supplement based tools too. I’m not leaping to nicotine just yet. Don’t need it. Maybe someday.
