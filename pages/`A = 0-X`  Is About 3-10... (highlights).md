	- `a = 0-x`  is about 3-10x faster than `a = -x`  ðŸ¤¯
	  
	  Let's jump into JavaScript VM details to see why and how to guard against this VM de-opt:

	- The first thing to understand is that JavaScript has two representations for numbers:
	- Let's assume: `x` is an Integer and `x = 0`
	  `0-x` => `0-0 => 0`, Result is `0` (Integer) Perfect!
	  `-x` => negate `x`.
	- Why is this a de-opt:
	  
	  1) Array access requires an Integer. So VM has to guard for Floats and convert Float (-0) into Integer(0);
	  
	  2) VMs have special "fast" arrays for all integers but use a more generic (slower) array for an array of mixed types (such as Integers and Floats)

	- Different browsers have different perf penalties for this, but my tests show a 3-10x slow down on Apple M1:
