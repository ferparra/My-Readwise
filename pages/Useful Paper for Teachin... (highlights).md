	- Useful paper for teaching & learning. Tell students: “Your goal is to feel awkward and uncomfortable.”
	  
	  Giving an explicit goal of aiming to feel uncomfortable in order to grow makes folks persist in classes, write better, seek out more info & learn more from political opponents.

	- “Instead of avoiding the [[discomfort]] inherent to [[growth]], people should seek it as a sign of [[progress]]. Growing is often uncomfortable; we find that embracing discomfort can be motivating.” Paper is here: https://t.co/Y1kzaGkOHc
