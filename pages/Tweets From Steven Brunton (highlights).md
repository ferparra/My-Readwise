	- Just finished filming an entire 8 week series on Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems!!
	  
	  This is one of my favorite topics in all of math. And this finishes up all the videos for a two-quarter, 60 hour set of lectures on Engineering Mathematics!

	- My favorite topic in dynamical systems: Chaos!!! 
	  
	  This is what got me interested in applied math as an undergrad.  The three body problem in planetary dynamics, the double pendulum, turbulence, and more!
