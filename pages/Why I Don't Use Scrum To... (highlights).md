	- Why I don't use [[Scrum]] to manage my Remote Teams?
	  
	  TL;DR: It adds at least 8 hours of meetings per [[Sprint]]. That's 2 full days of lost productivity, per team member, per month!
	  
	  This is what I do instead ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1577644315924467712))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Earlier in my career, I did use [[Scrum]]. A lot, actually.
	  
	  At times because I was pushed to do it. Other times because I didn't know better.
	  
	  Everyone was doing it, so it felt like the natural way to manage tech projects to me. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1577644324573126659))
	- These were the normal "[[Scrum]] meetings" in my teams:
	- And those 8 hours of meetings got extended every Sprint.
	  
	  Because either:
	- I started seeing red flags in [[Scrum]] when I started implementing #asynchronous processes in my teams.
	  
	  I hired people in different time zones, and forcing them all to sit in so many meetings started feeling like a big bottleneck.
	  
	  [[Scrum]] isn't compatible with [[Async]], imo! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1577644333297188869))
	- Since then, I've stopped using [[Scrum]]. It was my first step to reduce [[meetings]] in my teams.
	  
	  Beyond the time actually spent in [[meetings]], they are also a big distraction for people who need to do deep work.
	  
	  Here I wrote more about 7 ways I replace meetings with [[async]] processes: https://t.co/PsW5WsDiut ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1577644336417832965))
	- Another thing I don't like in [[Scrum]] is how it forces all projects/features into a 2-week [[framework]].
	  
	  Some [[features]] are small and take just a few days. Others are enormous and take longer than 2 weeks.
	  
	  Not all types of effort fit well into such a fixed [[framework]]. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1577644338686853120))
	- For me, it makes more sense to develop software in a goal-oriented way.
	  
	  "Goal" meaning: A clear business case that supports *Why* such feature needs to be built.
	  
	  Eg: "We need HIPAA compliance to sell to clients in the Healthcare sector" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1577644341308362752))
	- Between idea and shipping, there are many activities, such as:
	- 1. Why -> The clear business case.
	  
	  2. What -> The feature that will address the business case.
	  
	  3. How -> The technical approach to implement that solution.
	  
	  4. Who -> The team and resources needed for that effort.
	  
	  5. When -> The delivery timeline, for expectation alignment. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1577644352880496643))
	- Now, I don't bring my whole team into a "brainstorm" meeting to address these questions.
	  
	  Each depends on different stakeholders, and they can be tackled sequentially for the most part.
	  
	  In my teams, all these 5 questions live in the same collaborative document. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1577644355116056576))
	- I have these 5 questions as sections of a Notion template.
	  
	  Some rules are:
	  
	  1. We can only define the "What" after we understand the "Why".
	  
	  2. We can only plan the "How" after the "What" is clear.
	  
	  3. Defining the "How" implies discussing tradeoffs that affect "Who" and "When".

	- Usually the document is started by a business stakeholder, or a Product Manager. They define the "Why".
	  
	  Eg of "Why": We need comply with regulations in the Healthcare sector, so we can expand our sales in that vertical. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1577644367573143554))
	- From this "Why", a Product Manager usually crafts the What. It needs to be clear enough so that Engineers understand it, but flexible enough to take input around feasibility and implementation tradeoffs.
	  
	  Eg of "What": Our data needs to be stored in HIPAA compliant servers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1577644370014208002))
	- The "How", "Who" and "When" are usually collaborative, and led by technical stakeholders, eg: an EM.
	  
	  Resources or time constraints, force to cut scope. Trade offs are to be discussed collaboratively.
	  
	  Eg of "How": Move database and file system to HIPAA compliant AWS services. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1577644372010622983))
	- The "How" discussion should clarify the tasks to be done and the assignee for each of them, the "Who".
	  
	  Trade offs regarding timeline should have been clarified, and shared expectations about "When" should have been aligned.
	  
	  It ends with ownership + accountability to deliver! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1577644374028161024))
	- In my teams, we can do this without meetings for most tasks.
	  
	  For tasks with denser trade off considerations, we jump on a meeting to discuss those live and commit to an approach.
	  
	  Long iterations over async comms can create very long lead times, so I opt for meeting on those. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1577644375965835266))
	- This is how I shifted from a heavy meeting [[culture]] (led by [[Scrum]]), to an [[Async]]-first workflow.
	  
	  I can tell it was one of the key contributions to this acute before & after effect in my career.
	  
	  I'm more productive, my teams are more efficient, and none of us is burned out. https://t.co/NXqlVejsz5 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1577644378117611521))
	- I'm launching the course "Mastering Remote Work" soon. It includes a deep dive into the processes I use to manage my remote teams around the globe.

	- Interestingly, I read recently in @GergelyOrosz's newsletter that most [[Big Tech]] companies don't use [[Scrum]] either.
	  
	  Instead, they use some variant of [[Plan]] > [[Build]] > [[Ship]]. I had never seen that coined as a process, but resonates a lot with my approach.
