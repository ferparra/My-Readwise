	  What's frame control and also not say frame control in general because that's part of human interaction Uh, yeah, frame control is like a way of manipulating somebody else that is non obvious So there's a negative connotation to that usually Yeah, I mean, I think maybe I chose the term kind of poorly because I think to some degree people are always a little bit Manipulating each other, but I think it's generally obvious like for example if I disagree with you I want you to believe what I believe. Yeah, but this is like an obvious thing that is like visible between it's like an object on the table It's like here's the box where I want you to believe what you want to disagree with box. Yeah, so digresser It's like right like we're under a shared context where we understand that like we're trying to move each other. Yeah, this is chill To me. I think this is cool. Yeah, we just all the time and it's important But frame control is the kind of thing where you are trying carefully to obscure the existence of that box. Yeah, you're like Oh, um, the thing that I'm doing I'm like using tactics to try to influence what your reality is without us being both aware that This is what I'm doing. Yeah, I've been assuming you're doing that the whole time No, oh my god I have to like figure out how to read your facial expressions. I'm still learning. There's none. There's none You don't have any I'm like a I'm not even like a chat gbt.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I'm like gbt one with my facial expressions like it's kind of off Like this doesn't seem to match emotions, but it's kind of intelligent seemingly, but definitely not conscious anyway, so like negative connotation Manipulating right not being honest about the actual intentions of the Yeah, of how you'd like to control the conversation I think there might be a naive version of interpreting this where you're just like oh, I'm trying to like subtly get you to You know believe like oh, do you really think that's bad though?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  But this is not quite what I mean. I mean there's like a couple like concrete things that are signs of frame control like one of them is pushing the painful update button, which is this thing where it's like uh, hey if you Uh learned this it's going to be really painful. The truth is painful And if you're Realizing this thing about yourself, it's going to hurt and this is a sign that you're heading in the right direction So if you frame all pain as a sign of virtue and this means that pain that's a resulting as as damage Is something you're going to ignore So it's like this is it's a common like cults, right? This is for your own good. Oh, uh, you know You've you've faced a brave truth about yourself that you're like not quite as wise as I am Um, when really your brain might be trying to tell you protected things or like another one is like finger trap beliefs Um where the belief is constructed in such a way that doubting it lens proof to the belief So a very common example is like Satan like the christians are like, uh, you know, Satan is going to try to make you doubt him The existence of he's gonna so doubt like maybe he's not actually real And so if you believe in Satan and then you're like, okay now i'm having doubts like maybe he isn't real This is like, oh, this is exactly what I was taught to expect like I am doubting this belief because I was told Because like this is what Satan does and it's taken his evidence for it. So like the attempt to move away from the belief like Re like rebounds on you and like causes you to be more embedded inside of the belief Yeah So it's like techniques like these like very subtle things where like being inside of the system sort of just self-reinforces the system Is what I consider to be frame control And Have you met people that are really good at this kind of frame control?
