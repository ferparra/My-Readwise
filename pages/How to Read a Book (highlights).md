document_note:: This document by Adler and Van Doren explains how to properly read any text, from newspapers to books and philosophy to plays. It outlines four different levels of reading - elementary, inspectional, analytical and syntopical - and offers suggestions on how to read different types of genres and topics. It also provides tips on how to be a demanding reader, such as asking questions while reading and taking notes. It provides details on how to X-ray a book and how to read science, math and philosophy. Finally, it explains the fourth level of reading: syntopical reading, which involves determining which books are worth reading and analyzing the discussion.

- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Feb 17th, 2023]]
	- Ask questions while reading - what is the book about, what is discussed in detail, is the book true, why is it important. Write the answers to these questions on the cover page and as you read through it, answer them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse7m6d9w55mded5bjwrgs0d))
	- **4 Different Levels of reading -** elementary, inspectional, analytical, syntopical ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse7mbyv18mjtgnajj0dxxgt))
	- The Activity and Art of Reading
	  
	  •   Reading correctly will improve your understanding
	  •   Today, there are way too many facts and much too little understanding
	  •   Active reading + skill = better understanding
	  •   Reading for information (newspaper, magazine, etc.) or understanding are very different things
	    •   To truly understand something new is often exhausting. Remembering facts versus enlightenment ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse7mhcvdd602tq10ca2ve84))
		- **Note**: This document explains the importance of actively engaging with a book in order to gain a better understanding of its contents. It emphasizes the difference between reading for information, such as in a newspaper or magazine, and reading for understanding. It also highlights that enlightenment is often more difficult than simply remembering facts.
	- The Levels of Reading
	  
	  •   **Goal of reading a certain book determines how you read it**
	  •   **There are 4 levels of reading - elementary, inspectional, analytical and syntopical**
	  
	  •   This is the very beginning stages of learning how to read and put sentences together
	  •   Our ability to read, when you think about it is incredible. We are able to turn symbols into meaning ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse7n5vjs7r672y0dgkqetc3))
		- **Note**: Reading a book requires determining the goal of the reading, and there are four levels of reading - elementary, inspectional, analytical and syntopical. Elementary reading requires understanding how to put sentences together, while inspectional and analytical reading involve interpreting the text and understanding its meaning. Syntopical reading involves comparing and contrasting different texts. All levels of reading involve understanding symbols and turning them into meaning.
	- The Second Level of Reading: Inspectional Reading
	  
	  •   Skim the book before reading it to see if it is actually worth reading - get the author's main arguments
	    •   Look at the title, preface, table of contents (very important), index (key words), dust jacket, chapter titles and then jump around and read random passages throughout the book
	  •   Superficial reading - with difficult books, read completely without stopping. This will help not "lose the forest for the trees"
	  •   Reading speed should vary based on the goal, nature and complexity of the book
	  •   In order to read faster and still comprehend, underline passages with your finger/pen and don't subvocalize ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse7njzhadeqbt42r1v27450))
		- **Note**: Inspectional reading is a second level of reading that involves skimming a book to determine if it is worth reading, looking at the title, preface, table of contents, and index, and then jumping around and reading random passages. Reading speed should be varied depending on the purpose and complexity of the book, and one should underline passages with their finger or pen in order to read faster and still comprehend.
	- How to Be a Demanding Reader
	  
	  •   **Ask questions while reading - what is the book about, what is discussed in detail, is the book true, why is it important. Write the answers to these questions on the cover page and as you read through it, answer them**
	    •   Best practices - Underline, vertical lines in margin, asterisks, numbers in margin to track arguments, circle key words, fold important pages, write questions/thoughts in margins
	  •   Use empty page to outline book once finished
	  •   3 Types of note taking - structural, conceptual and dialectical (shape of the discussion) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse7p6cq0be8j1t138tmfahr))
		- **Note**: The document explains how to become a demanding reader by asking questions while reading, and provides best practices for note taking such as underlining, circling, and folding. It also outlines three types of note taking - structural, conceptual and dialectical - to help shape the discussion. Finally, it suggests using an empty page to outline the book once it is finished.
	- Pigeonholing a Book
	  
	  •   **Must classify a book before reading it.** Is it expository (gain knowledge) psychology, math, history, etc.
	  •   Practical (how to) vs theoretical (arguing that something is a certain way)
	    •   Manuals, guides, etc. vs. scientific/philosophical books
	  •   Different topics taught differently and must read in appropriate manner ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse7pyp16q1237fvp66aytyj))
		- **Note**: Before reading a book, it is important to classify it into either expository (to gain knowledge) or practical (how to), as well as scientific/philosophical versus manuals, guides, etc. Different topics require different reading approaches, so it is important to understand the type of book before reading it.
	- X-Raying a Book
	  
	  •   Strip book to its skeleton - be able to summarize succinctly and relate how the parts feed into the whole, answer what questions the author is trying to answer
	  •   **First stage of analytical reading or finding out what a book is about**
	    •   **Classify the book according to kind and subject matter**
	    •   **State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity**
	    •   **Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole**
	    •   **Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse7qen32y57anwecjyfq2xj))
		- **Note**: The first stage of analytical reading is to classify the book according to kind and subject matter, state what the whole book is about in the utmost brevity, enumerate its major parts in order and relation and outline them, and define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve. This process helps to strip the book to its skeleton, enabling the reader to succinctly summarize the content and how its parts feed into the whole.
	- Coming to Terms With An Author
	  
	  •   Coming to terms means having clear, unambiguous communication between the author and the reader
	  •   Determine key words and what the author is trying to get across by using it
	    •   Focus on those that give you trouble ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse7r1tqy1w5yvm1md8khjap))
		- **Note**: Reading a book requires the reader to come to terms with the author by understanding the key words and concepts that the author is trying to communicate. It is important to focus on words or phrases that may be difficult to understand in order to fully comprehend the author's message.
	- Determining an Author's Message
	  
	  •   Must know both author's propositions and his reasons - why we are to believe him
	  •   Focus on difficult passages - "Wonder is the beginning of wisdom" - [Socrates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates)
	  •   "Translate" author's message using your own words and try to imagine it playing out. Greatly helps you realize if you truly understand the message and argument
	  •   **Second stage of analytical reading , finding out what the book says (interpreting)**
	    •   **Come to terms with the author interpreting his key words**
	    •   **Grasp the author's leading propositions by dealing with his most important sentences**
	    •   **Know the author's arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences**
	    •   **Determine which of the problems the author has solved and which they have not; and as to the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse7rmg860cxb3kwmjefyct9))
		- **Note**: The second stage of analytical reading is determining an author's message. This involves understanding the author's key words, grasping the author's leading propositions, knowing the author's arguments, and determining which problems the author has solved and which have not. It is important to use one's own words to interpret the author's message, and to imagine it playing out to ensure understanding. A quote from Socrates can be used as a prompt to help with this process.
	- Criticizing a Book Fairly
	  
	  •   Reading is a conversation between author and reader
	    •   Must completely understand their argument before can critique
	    •   Make sure learning, not arguing is the goal of disagreeing
	    •   Knowledge (evidence) vs. opinion (unsupported judgment) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse7s8yt966z9agxnc0mqp5t))
		- **Note**: In order to fairly criticize a book, it is important to understand the author's argument before forming an opinion. When disagreeing, it is important to focus on learning rather than arguing. It is also important to differentiate between knowledge (evidence) and opinion (unsupported judgment).
	- Agreeing or Disagreeing with the Author
	  
	  •   Must be aware of emotions, be impartial and know own assumptions
	  •   Can disagree in 4 ways - author is misinformed, uninformed, illogical or argument is incomplete
	  •   Need specific evidence to convincingly agree or disagree
	  •   **The Third Stage of Analytical Reading, criticizing a book**
	    •   **Don't criticize until have completed your outline and interpretation**
	    •   **Do not disagree contentiously**
	    •   **Demonstrate that you recognize the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good reasons**
	    •   **Show where the author is uniformed, misinformed, illogical or incomplete** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse7vj8ts4swjnjbmfw1k1nd))
		- **Note**: In the third stage of analytical reading, it is important to be aware of emotions and know one's own assumptions in order to agree or disagree with the author. There are four ways to disagree, such as when the author is misinformed, uninformed, illogical, or the argument is incomplete. To convincingly agree or disagree, specific evidence is needed. When criticizing a book, it is important to have completed the outline and interpretation first, and to not be contentious. It is also important to recognize the difference between knowledge and personal opinion, and to provide good reasons for any disagreements.
	- How to Read History
	  
	  •   Can never rely on only one author or POV for history
	  •   Read history to also learn about the present and the future
	  •   Must know precisely what the book is or is not about
	  •   Biographies are either definitive (scholarly), authorized (commissioned) or ordinary (some combination)
	    •   Take autobiographies with a grain of salt as they can never be totally free from bias
	  •   For current books, ask the following questions - know what the author wants to prove, who does he want to convince, what special knowledge does he assume, does he use any special language and does he really know what he is talking about?
	  •   Must be careful when reading digests (condensed or summarized info) as a lot of information is compressed into few words ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse7wgq35serw99kgda3ma8g))
		- **Note**: In order to read history effectively, it is important to read from multiple authors and points of view. Reading history should also be done to learn about the present and future. It is essential to know what a book is about in order to read it effectively. Biographies can come in three forms - definitive, authorized, and ordinary - and autobiographies should be taken with a grain of salt due to potential bias. When reading current books, one should ask questions such as what the author is trying to prove, who they are trying to convince, what special knowledge they assume, if they use any special language, and if they really know what they are talking about. When reading digests, one should be careful as a lot of information is condensed into few words.
	- How to Read Philosophy
	  
	  •   Adult's curiosity deteriorates in quality as they tend not to care "why," only "what"
	  •   **"A mind not agitated by good questions cannot appreciate the significance of even the best answers"**
	  •   Must be childishly simple in our questions and maturely wise in our answers
	  •   Theoretical/speculative - what is/happens in the world
	  •   Practical/normative - what ought to be sought
	  •   Know strengths and weaknesses of different philosophical styles
	  •   2 Types of theology - natural and dogmatic
	  •   Canonical - one and only one right way to read something (such as the Bible) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse7xc6p34zm75gk9x1pqhhm))
		- **Tags**: #[[philosophy]]
		- **Note**: The key to effectively reading philosophy is to ask good questions and seek wise answers, maintaining a balance between childish simplicity and mature wisdom. Additionally, two types of theology must be distinguished, natural and dogmatic, with the latter being a system in which there is only one correct way to read something.
	- The Fourth Level of Reading: Syntopical Reading
	  
	  •   Must determine which books are or are not worth devoting time to
	    •   Read different works at different speeds
	  •   5 Steps - determine which passages are important to *you,* must use your own language and not that of the authors (translate), formulate questions you want answered, define the issues and different POV, analyze the discussion - answers often lie in the opposing POV
	  •   **This type of reading you must aim for objectivity - must know own mind, opinion and biases**
	  •   **For Syntopical reading**
	    •   **Create a possible bibliography of books on your subject**
	    •   **Inspect all of the books to acquire a clear idea and identify the relevant works**
	    •   **Bring the author to terms**
	    •   **Establish a set of neutral propositions for all of the authors**
	    •   **Define the issues, both major and minor**
	    •   **Analyze the discussion by creating questions you want answered** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse7ymq47f39dz64mr5wy5x0))
		- **Note**: The fourth level of reading, Syntopical Reading, is the most advanced and requires an objective approach. The steps involve determining which passages are important to the reader, translating the authors' language into one's own, formulating questions to be answered, defining the issues and different points of view, and analyzing the discussion. To reach this level, one must create a possible bibliography of books on the subject, inspect all of the books to acquire a clear idea, bring the authors to terms, establish a set of neutral propositions, and define both major and minor issues.
