document_note:: The author states that vitamin B12 is very important for the nervous system and is involved in the production of neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, dopamine, GABA, and serotonin. Additionally, a study from 2000 found that at least two out of five people on a normal diet are somewhat deficient in vitamin B12. The author also mentions that the more B12 you consume, the less efficiently it is absorbed, and that products like Five Hour Energy contain a very high amount of B12.

The author states that l-theanine is a nootropic that helps one relax without making them drowsy, and that it is effective in raising GABA, dopamine, and serotonin levels. The author also states that l-theanine can help improve mood and focus, and that pairing it with caffeine can result in better memory and attention. Finally, the author suggests that l-theanine may make it easier to do creative work, possibly because it relaxes them and/or raises serotonin levels.

The author discusses various nootropics or "smart pills" that they have personally tried and found effective, including l-theanine for relaxation, exogenous ketones for mental energy, nicotine gum for improved focus, ginkgo biloba for motivation, and aniracetam for creativity. They also mention the importance of proper nutrition, particularly getting enough B vitamins, iodine, and selenium, for brain function. However, they caution against relying solely on nootropics and suggest considering diet as a first step.
