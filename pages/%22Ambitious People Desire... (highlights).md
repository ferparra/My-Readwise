	- "Ambitious people desire not only to be recognized but also to be deemed worthy of recognition. The concept of [[ambition]] is invariably tied to notions of honor and deference. Today, however, these terms have an obsolete sound."

	- "'Honor,' as the sociologist Peter L. Berger has written, 'occupies about the same place in contemporary usage as chastity,' that is, as 'ideological leftovers in the consciousness of obsolete classes, such as military officers or ethnic grandmothers.'"

	- "...fame, glory, renown...have traditionally been associated with aristocratic societies...Acts of [[bravery]], [[heroism]] and self-abnegation were often linked to a person’s role in a [[social hierarchy]]...There is certainly a zero-sum quality to terms like [[honor]] and [[ambition]]."

	- "Yet the study of heroes seems to have something old-fashioned, if not elitist, about it...Modern history and social science tend to be increasingly quantitative and data-driven, dealing more with the average than outsized individuals." And how's that working out?

	- "...the concept of self-interest is not a universal key for understanding all human behavior, as is so often claimed by economists and social scientists today. Rather, the idea of self-interest emerged as a strategy to counteract the dominance of certain passions..."

	- "The idea of a modern commercial order came to fruition in America...The advocates...regarded an ethic of self-interest rightly understood as a sane and sensible alternative to visions of moral perfection beyond the reach of all but a few, disdain for the common...employments..."

	- "[John] Adams... divided [the love of fame] into three parts. Credit is on the lowest rung supported by merchants and tradesmen; reputation was cherished by gentlemen; but glory was the highest species of fame and was reserved for the great actions of lawgivers..."

	- "The name Caesar and its later variants like 'Kaiser' and 'Czar' would become the title for a new kind of political leader for which classical political philosophy had no precise equivalent." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kerry62189/status/1422779331995213825))
	- "Caesarism is a form of postconstitutional rule combining elements of traditional kingship with populist demagoguery and charismatic leadership." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kerry62189/status/1422779333987475456))
	- "The most obvious reading of [Lincoln's address] is as a warning about the emergence of the romantic hero..his reference to those who would achieve greatness through emancipating slaves is an unmistakable reference to...an offshoot of New England transcendentalism." 
	  Eh.

	- "Yet a minority view has held that Lincoln carried more of this higher-law politics than he cared to admit..." 
	  Closer to the mark, but not that close.

	- "Lincoln’s reference to emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen suggests the morally neutral form of this kind of great [[ambition]]. It can be used to achieve [[freedom]] as well as new forms of domination. The description is frighteningly prescient of.. [[Nietzsche]]’s [[Ubermensch]]."
	  Yes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kerry62189/status/1422779349766397953))
	- "These readers...draw the wrong conclusion. Lincoln understood...that the great political founders were inspired not by wealth...or pleasure...but by honor...and recognition. It is these higher-order goals that testify to a certain breadth of soul and loftiness of outlook."

	- "Yet it was precisely because of his imaginative sympathy for this kind of grand ambition that made it possible for [[Lincoln]] to resist it...[[Lincoln]] believed that no one who had ever been tempted by grand [[ambition]] would have the capacity to resist it."
	  Exactly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kerry62189/status/1422779356569554946))
	- "Lincoln’s...towering genius is far from the prosaic usurper...Such a person prefers to rule in Hell than to serve in Heaven. His is a revolt not against an unjust order but against any order of which he is not the author..."

	- "[Lincoln] remains closer to the classical understanding that regarded politics as theater—not merely of power and interest (although these can certainly never be discounted)—but where the desire for fame, glory, honor and renown are given free expression."
