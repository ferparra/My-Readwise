	- Play it out in your mind. Have the full unabashed conversation like that person was standing right in front of you. Talk to them. Remember why you aren't together. If it was mutual, then this usually works. If it's one-sided, and your heart is broken, embrace it. Embrace the pain, remember, if there isn't anything you can do about the situation, the only thing you can change is the way you react to it. [[Amor Fati]]. Love your fate.
	- I'm 40 now, and it seems the older I get, the easier it becomes to walk away from people. I've met the "love of my life" 3 different times, I've loved women without ever telling them, I've been rejected, cheated on, dumped, ghosted, married and divorced. I've had one night stands, and 12 year relationships. The only thing I can tell you is that the people we chose to love, leave pieces of themselves within us.

	- There's nothing more I like to dothan drift to sleep and dream of you.I think of you,and how you smile,and what you do,and for a while,there's only you,and only me -and nowhere else I'd rather be.But mornings break,and nights move on.And then I wake.And then you're gone.
