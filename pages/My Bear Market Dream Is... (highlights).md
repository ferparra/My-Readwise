	- My bear market dream is buying at the Bitcoin Electrical value price. So currently around $23K.
	  
	  But during Bitcoin's life, we have never had a proper, lasting tradfi bear market.
	  
	  The S&P is only down -18% (nothing) so far. 
	  
	  This changes everything...

	- 2/ 
	  
	  While a lot of metric are oversold, suggesting we are due for a short-term bounce, a lot of tradfi charts are turning really sour.
	  
	  Equally weighted S&P500.
	  
	  Can a topping formation get much uglier than this?

	- 3/ Energy vs Tech.
	  
	  Decadal breakout happening right now.

	- 4/ Value Vs Growth.
	  
	  Buffett is laughing all the way to the bank as the market reprices his value stocks higher.

	- 5/ 10 Year Treasuries.
	  
	  Most promising looking of all so far (and its not that promising). The 10 year has taken a hit after today's higher than expected inflation. If this continues tracking down, it will provide a lot of relief to risk assets.

	- 6/ Mortgage purchasing.
	  
	  Concerningly weak.

	- 7/ Yield Curve.
	  
	  It inverted last month. Historically a recession has always followed within 3-9 months of this happening.

	- 8/ Unemployment Rates.
	  
	  Haven't bottomed yet, but when they do, bad things usually happen. Could be happening now, could be a long way out. But being so low now suggests late stage cycle.

	- 9/ Initial Unemployment Claims.
	  
	  Less than desirable increase recently, but still early.

	- 10/ Manufacturing.
	  
	  Still looks fine. But could be the start of a topping process. This chart is not as bearish as most suggest though.

	- 11/ Put Call ratio.
	  
	  When you get a lot of green like this, it usually happens on the way to a major bottom. Suggests market is heavily oversold.

	- 12/ VIX Near- to Far-Term
	  
	  No record of it ever being this oversold.  Suggests bottom formation, at least in last 10 years of data.

	- 13/ 
	  
	  All-in-all it looks like most major economic metrics are rolling over, but are perhaps locally oversold (like the prior two charts).  This could suggest a bounce is due in near term, but that we are quite possibly in a major bear market.
	  
	  Could it all reverse soon? Maybe... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/caprioleio/status/1524499697955708928))
	- 14/ But current Fed policy suggests this thing will not resolve quickly.
	  
	  Perhaps a change of policy later this year will set a turnaround point, but a lot can happen between now and then. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/caprioleio/status/1524499699847290880))
	- 15/ Wrapping up.
	  
	  Electrical cost has been a great buy zone in the last 10 years of relatively peaceful up-only markets.
	  
	  If tradfi stabilizes from here, it probably still will be.
	  
	  But if the tradfi floor falls out, expect much wider volatility deviations this time around. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/caprioleio/status/1524499701642543104))
