	- Meditation can show you that there's no self
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Meditation has many benefits, but the real promise is in the deeper claim that the self is an illusion., * The main purpose of meditation is not in the long list of benefits, but in the deeper claim.)

	  And it's from the point of view of being a locus of attention that is now aiming attention strategically at an object like the breath, that there's this dualism that is set up and ultimately the ultimate promise of meditation. I mean, there are really two levels at which you could be interested in meditation. One is, you know, very straightforward and remedial and non paradoxical and very well subscribed. And it's the usual set of claims about all the benefits you're going to get for meditation, right? So you're going to lower your stress and you're going to increase your focus and you're going to, you know, stave off cortical thinning and all kinds of good things that science is saying meditation will give you. And none of that entails really drilling down on this paradoxical claim that the self is an illusion or anything else of that sort. But from my point of view, the real purpose of meditation and its real promise is not in this long list of benefits. You know, I'm not discounting any of those, though, you know, the science for many of them is quite provisional. It's in this deeper claim that if you look for this thing, you're calling I if you look for the sense that there's a thinker in addition to the mirror rising of the next thought say, you won't find that thing. And, and you can, what's more, you cannot find it in a way that's conclusive and that matters, right? ([Time 0:16:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cfc6b7fe-3d34-4584-b6c9-3e212351f5e8))
	- [[Meditation]] helps you realize your thinking
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Meditation is a way to become aware of the lack of separation between oneself and one's experience, and eventually it becomes effortless.)

	  I mean, if it makes a point of contact to what I'm talking about, it's really just at one point, you know, and it's at the point where this sense of subject object division in consciousness is illusory and vulnerable to investigation. And if you investigate it as sort of the right plane of focus, you know, you pick the analogy you want from, you know, whether it's, you know, setting up the, the, the optic blind spot experiment in just the right way so that you can see that, you know, it's actually not the data is not there. Or, I mean, the bi-stable percept is great, because, you know, when you see one of these images, like the vase, face diagram or, you know, the Dalmatian, you know, that looks like just a mess of dots and then you see the image of a Dalmatian dog pop out. Once you see it, you really can't unsee it. I mean, like once you have the requisite conceptual, you know, anchor to it, then every time you look, you're going to find it again and eventually becomes effortless. And that's what ultimately meditation is. I mean, this kind of meditation, you ultimately learn to recognize that there's no separation from you between you and your experience, right? There's not the experience on the one hand and the self on the other. ([Time 0:53:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/587c60fb-120d-47ef-a4fa-d7f8a1a6d701))
