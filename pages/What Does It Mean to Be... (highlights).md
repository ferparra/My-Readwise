	- Over 1 billion people worldwide earn a living by thinking and writing. How do you stand out?
	  
	  Not by hoarding your knowledge.
	  
	  You only stand out when you share what you know.
	  
	  If you want to stand out in your company, be known for learning constantly and quickly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1376581433444204547))
	- Learning is essential to stay relevant in your job.

	- Knowledge workers are paid to provide answers.
	  
	  They take in information, make sense of it, and produce something that others take in as input.
	  
	  But what if they're stuck? Then they need to learn.
	  
	  As reality changes quickly, learning has become the work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1376581436745072645))
	- Much like knowledge workers, professional learners spend their days making sense of information.
	  
	  But, learners don't pretend they know; they're humble and open to new solutions. They force themselves to think creatively.
	  
	  Learners are therefore better problem solvers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1376581437705621510))
	- Professional learners are valuable assets for their company.
	  
	  Being able to make sense of information quickly is an important skill. When you have a higher resolution of reality, it becomes easier to make smart decisions.
	  
	  Learners uncover the insights needed for innovation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1376581438636752898))
	- Everyone can become a professional learner.
	  
	  As you do you job, see where you could improve. Systematize your improvements so it becomes easier to share your process.
	  
	  By sharing what they know, learners can become leaders without entering a management position. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1376581439622418433))
	- Being a professional learner also means being a teacher.
	  
	  The best learners realize that they will learn more quickly if they teach. So, they share their knowledge freely and adjust their explanations as needed.
	  
	  Where there's one prolific learner, there will soon be many. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1376581440616464384))
	- When you teach to learn, you learn more deeply.
	  
	  It's easy to fool yourself into thinking that you understand something. Only when you try to explain an idea, do you discover if you've understood it.
	  
	  Force yourself to explain ideas and be humble to change your understanding. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1376581441832771596))
	- Teaching others provides valuable feedback.
	  
	  When you keep your ideas for yourself, you won't know if they make sense and are applicable. When you teach other experts, you will soon discover if your ideas are viable.
	  
	  When teaching, look for the practical application. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1376581443061682178))
	- Teaching is essential if you want to leverage your knowledge.
	  
	  Learning the solution to a problem enables you to solve it. When you teach your process to others, they're able to solve this and similar problems.
	  
	  Remove yourself as a bottleneck by teaching others. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1376581444047343620))
	- ⛔️ When you believe you should have answers ready, you won't move out of your comfort zone.
	  
	  ⛔️ When you think it's bad to not know the answer, you will try to protect your ego.
	  
	  ✅ When you believe it's okay to not know, you'll be humble enough to learn. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1376581445238542343))
