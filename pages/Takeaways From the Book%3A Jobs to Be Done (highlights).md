document_note:: Jobs to be Done (JTBD) is a methodology that has been around for some time. It is part of the Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI) methodology which uses qualitative and quantitative research to uncover the reasons why customers use an offering, and also to discover the core jobs customers are trying to get done. ODI allows companies to increase their chances for success at innovation by knowing the metrics customers use to measure success and value when getting a job done. A value proposition will fail to connect with customers if it does not align with unmet customer needs. Customers know the metrics they use to measure success when executing a job and are capable of communicating them. Segmenting customers based on unmet needs is the key to an effective market and product strategy. A job is a stable concept that doesn't change over time, has no geographical boundaries, and is defined as a verb plus an object of the verb plus a contextual clarifier. Desired outcome statements include a direction of improvement, a performance metric, an object of control, and a contextual clarifier. ODI is conducted by sending out surveys to customers to have them rank jobs and outcomes by importance and satisfaction and plotting the results on a chart. There are four strategic directions of innovation when dealing with a job. Three customer types must be involved in research: the end user, the product life cycle support team, and the purchase decision maker. Lastly, all jobs consist of some or all of the eight fundamental process steps.

	  •   A job is stable; it doesn’t change over time. It’s the delivery vehicle or the technology that changes.
	  •   A job has no geographical boundaries. People who live in the USA, France, UK, Germany, South Korea, China, Russia, Brazil, and Australia, have many jobs in common
	  •   A job is solution-agnostic. The Job-Done does not care if your company provides product, software, or service offerings.
