	- Why is the laplacian so ubiquitous? Well, locally any reasonable PDE is well approximated by a linear one. And linear PDEs are of the form Lu = f for a linear differentiable operator L. But why does the particular case of L = laplacian show up so often in physics? Galilean invariance says that the laws of physics should be invariant under translation and rotation. Checking this against Lu = f, you can verify that one requires that L commute with translations and rotations. That is L(u_h) = (Lu)_h, where u_h(x) = u(x+h), and similarly for rotations. What you can show (pretty easily on the Fourier side) is that every linear differential operator with these properties is a polynomial in the Laplacian.
