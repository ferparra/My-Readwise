	- Can you ever be "aware of your own substrate"? Dancing Qualia & Yudkowsky say: no.

	- So, if binding is computationally useful, then an information processing system that uses binding as part of its pipeline would benefit from modeling the fact that binding has special pros and cons. I.e. intelligent systems might be implicitly aware of having phenomenal binding! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1609467022559133696))
