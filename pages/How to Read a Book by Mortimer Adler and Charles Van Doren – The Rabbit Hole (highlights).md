	- Ask questions while reading – what is the book about, what is discussed in detail, is the book true, why is it important. Write the answers to these questions on the cover page and as you read through it, answer them.
	- Must classify a book before reading it.
	- 4 Different Levels of reading – elementary, inspectional, analytical, syntopical
	- Know the author’s arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences
	- Point is not to be competent in the specific field but to understand the problem being presented
