	- If you're struggling to stay consistent with literally any goal, try applying the Atomic Habits mindset. 
	  
	  It helped me on my journey to almost 4 million YouTube subscribers, and I still use it today with things like fitness and daily journalling. 
	  
	  Here's how ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1629089515460562945))

	- Let's use YouTube as an example: 
	  
	  1. Whatâ€™s your goal and why? 
	  I'd suggest 1 video a week. It's important to decide what content you want to make and why, to motivate yourself. 
	  
	  2. What tasks will help you get there?  
	  i.e. research, scripting, filming, editing ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1629089518593757184))
	- 3. When will you get started? 
	  Set a date and calendar block those individual tasks. Be realistic but firm with yourself 
	  
	  4. Start habit stacking - film multiple videos in one day, or scripting in your lunch break, for example 
	  
	  5. Stay consistent + results will follow :) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1629089521781428224))
	- All it takes to form a habit is a quick calendar shuffle and commitment to do the things. 
	  
	  Like @JamesClear says: â€œYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1629089524952498177))
