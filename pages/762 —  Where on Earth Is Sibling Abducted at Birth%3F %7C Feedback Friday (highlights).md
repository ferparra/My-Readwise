	  This episode is sponsored in part by HV.M.N. You probably heard the buzz about ketone supplements. They can boost your workouts. They help your body use fatty acids for fuel. I take a shot of HV.M.N.'s ketone IQ supplement before my morning workouts. It's focused energy. The feeling is like being in the zone, but no anxiety, no jitters from too much caffeine, too much coffee, you know, the feeling. Ketone IQ come in portable, convenient shots, which are perfect for on-the-go cycling, a long run, running from meeting to meeting pre-workout. One fair warning. I've said it before. It tastes like it works, right? They're not trying to mask the flavor with sugar and sweeteners. I guess it's pure and unadulterated. So don't be scared to try it out. It really does work. And look, it's quick, right? It's a shot. If you can drink whiskey, you can drink this. I feel much more focused and less hungry during workouts. There's better endurance. I don't get that slow down or crash at the end nearly as quick. So if you're working out hard or you're training for something, definitely give ketone IQ a try. I'm quite curious. Tell me what you think of it. If you try it, I know a lot of you are going after it and a lot of my athlete friends use this stuff as well.
