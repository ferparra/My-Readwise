	- **Inertial confinement fusion** (**ICF**) is a [fusion energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_energy) research program that initiates [nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion) reactions by compressing and heating targets filled with thermonuclear fuel. In modern machines, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm48hyf3fbvxk4nsbnjyknay))
	- To compress and heat the fuel, energy is deposited in the outer layer of the target using high-energy beams of [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photons), [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron) or [ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion), although almost all ICF devices as of 2020[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inertial_confinement_fusion&action=edit) used lasers. The beams heat the outer layer, which explodes outward. This produces a reaction force against the remainder of the target, which accelerates it inwards and compresses the fuel. This process also creates [shock waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave) that travel inward through the target. Sufficiently powerful shock waves can compress and heat the fuel at the center such that fusion occurs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm48jmdvbc7ya4r3k3tt1mxx))
	- ICF is one of two major branches of fusion energy research, the other is [magnetic confinement fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_confinement_fusion). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm48jtr8hnd1s50ecca8zztt))
