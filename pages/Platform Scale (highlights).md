document_note:: Platform Scale is a book that explores how to create successful platform companies. It discusses the importance of efficient interactions, creating excess value, and scaling rapidly. It outlines five drivers of platform scale, including minimal marginal costs of production and distribution, network effects powered by positive feedback, behavior design and community culture, learning filters, and virality. It emphasizes the importance of curation and reputation as quality control, user journeys as sales funnels, and data science for business process optimization. It also discusses the power of plug-and-play business design and algorithms as decision makers, as well as behavior design and social feedback as loyalty programs. Finally, it suggests that the goal of a platform is to enable interactions between producers and consumers repeatedly and efficiently.

	- Plug-and-play is the new business development
	  
	  1.  Platform as an enabler of interactions - plug-and-play business design, balancing value creation for both producers and consumers, strategic choice of what is "free", pull/facilitate/match, layering on new interactions, enabling end-to-end interactions, creation of persistent value beyond the interaction
	  2.  At their core, platforms enable a plug-and-play business model. Other businesses can easily connect their business with the platform, build products and services on top of it, and co-create value. Platforms primarily benefit not from internal production but from a wider source of open co-creation and open market interactions. This ability to drive interactions through a plug-and-play infrastructure is a defining characteristic of platform scale ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsk4tzs73gfj9fnkxt5wrvk4))
		- **Note**: Platforms are a special type of business that helps people interact with each other and create value. A plug-and-play business model means that other businesses can easily connect to the platform and build things on top of it. This makes it possible for lots of people to work together and create even more value. This is a very important part of how platforms work and why they can be so successful.
	- The Core Value Unit
	  
	  1.  The core value unit is the minimum stand alone unit of value that is created on top of the platform. It represents supply or inventory created on top of the platform and without this, the platform has very little value in and of itself
	    1.  For network/marketplace/community-dominated - goods, standardized services, non-standardized services
	    2.  Infrastructure dominated - apps
	    3.  Data dominated - data helps the platform become more efficient overtime, data itself is the source of value
	    4.  To increase platform scale, focus on increasing the quality and quantity of core value units on the platform. However, platforms are unique in that they don't control this inventory as this is produced outside the platform
	    5.  All actions in the core interaction fall into one of the following buckets - creation, curation, customization, consumption. The keys to platform scale lie in simplifying each constituent action in the core interaction
	    6.  Information exchange has 3 components - The producer creates a core value unit, the consumer sets up a filter of some combination of overlap and data, the value unit that best passes through the filter is served to the consumer (based on good data and filters). Filter can be point in time (search) or cumulative (taking account of past history or behavior) or some combination ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsk4vx0ckhkzv5kxjw91hdrk))
		- **Note**: The core value unit is the smallest, individual unit of value that is created on the platform. This value or inventory is what makes the platform valuable and without it, the platform would not have much value. The core value unit can be different things depending on what type of platform it is. For example, a network/marketplace/community-dominated platform might have goods, standardized services, or non-standardized services as the core value unit. An infrastructure-dominated platform might have apps as the core value unit, and a data-dominated platform might have data as the core value unit. To make the platform bigger and better, the platform should focus on increasing both the quality and the quantity of the core value units. The platform does not actually control the core value units, because they are created outside the platform. Interactions on the platform can be divided into 4 categories: creation, curation, customization, and consumption. To make the platform bigger and better, all of these actions must be simplified. When someone wants to get a core value unit from the platform, they set up a filter of data. The filter can be based on a one-time search or take into account a person's past behavior. Then the best value unit that passes through the filter is served to the consumer.
	- The Chicken and the Egg Problem
	  
	  1.  All platforms must overcome the chicken and egg problem until they reach critical mass, the minimum network size at which there are enough producers and consumers of value on the platform to ensure that interactions spark off reliably ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsk4wzdty4z1vgf4zj34spzs))
		- **Note**: Platforms need to grow until they have enough people using them. This is known as reaching "critical mass," which is the minimum number of people who need to be using the platform to make sure that everyone can connect and interact with each other.
	- Scaling & Virality
	  
	  1.  Scaling strategies
	    1.  Bump - non-sustainable exposure such as PR, advertising and events; important for initial traction
	    2.  Engines - an internal engine of growth and designed to grow as a consequence of usage
	    3.  Also needs to create the hooks and motivations that will enable and incentive users to expose the offering to others, every time they use it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsk4xfx0m5kxrzw64ntrdhpp))
	- Virality and word of mouth are two names for the same phenomenon - virality a consequence of users using the platform, not loving the offering. Virality does not need fans, it merely needs users who are encouraged to bring in other users ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsk4z3bas24pw0ak48s1y635))
	- Virality is a design problem, not an optimization problem. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsk4yt32qh7z4ky8h0xhkhvp))
	- 4 key optimization priorities for achieving sustainable viral growth
	  
	  1.  Send: maximize outflow of units from the platform
	  2.  Spread: ensure that units spread on the external network
	  3.  Click: maximize clicks on an external network
	  4.  Convert: minimize cycle time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsk4ycsg48t90emtdfe1fxyv))
	- The platform canvas is a framework for makers to build interaction-first platform businesses and includes the value-creating interaction, the platform that enables the interaction, a mechanism for value capture, enablement of a plug-and-play business model through channels (websites and apps) and access control for producers and filter creation for consumers. The platform must provide tools and services of creation, curation, customization and consumption.
	  
	  1.  Value is derived from charging one side to access the other, charging a third party for advertising, charging producers and consumers for premium tools and services, charging consumers for access to high quality, curated producers and charging producers for an ability to signal high quality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsk4y48r4tfyz13ksxhxyrs8))
