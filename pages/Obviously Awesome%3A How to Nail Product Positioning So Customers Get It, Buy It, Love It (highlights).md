	- “Strategy is about making choices, trade-offs; it’s about deliberately choosing to be different.” MICHAEL PORTER ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrgg2n61a2v8497rgf8jmvv))

	- **Customers need to be able to easily understand what your product is, why it’s special and why it matters to them.** Context enables people to figure out what’s important. Positioning products is a lot like context setting in the opening of a movie. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrggdgj5nj00m4v05qk4bhf))
	- When customers encounter a product they have never seen before, they will look for contextual clues to help them figure out what it is, who it’s for and why they should care. Taken together, the messaging, pricing, features, branding, partners and customers create context and set the scene for the product. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrggk81c5hbgkwkf23n2av0))
		- **Note**: Product positioning should provide customers with context to help them understand what a product is, who it is for, and why they should care about it. This is done through messaging, pricing, features, branding, partners, and customers, which all contribute to the overall positioning of the product.
	- **Great positioning takes into account all of the following:**
	  
	  1.  **The customer’s point of view on the problem you solve and the alternative ways of solving that problem.**
	  2.  **The ways you are uniquely different from those alternatives and why that’s meaningful for customers.**
	  3.  **The characteristics of a potential customer that really values what you can uniquely deliver.**
	  4.  **The best market context for your product that makes your unique value obvious to those customers who are best suited to your product.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrggxdghyv4yrchens1ffg6))
		- **Note**: Product positioning involves understanding the customer's perspective on the issue being solved, the differences between the product and alternative solutions, the customers that will most benefit from the product, and the best market context for the product in order to make its value clear to its ideal customers.
	- •   Target market characteristics.
	    1.  The characteristics of a group of buyers that lead them to really care a lot about the value you deliver.
	    2.  Your sales and marketing efforts have to be focused on the customers who are most likely to buy from you. Your positioning needs to clearly identify who those folks are. And simply put, they are the customers who care the most about the value your product delivers. You need to identify what sets these folks apart. What is it about these customers that makes them love your product more than others? How can we identify them? Your target market is the customers who buy quickly, rarely ask for discounts and tell their friends about your offerings.
	  •   Market category.
	    1.  The market you describe yourself as being part of, to help customers understand your value.
	    2.  Declaring that your product exists in a certain market category will set off a powerful set of assumptions in customers’ minds about who your competitors are, what the functionality of the product should be and what the pricing is like.
	    3.  Your market category can work for you or against you. If you choose your category wisely, all the assumptions are working for you. You don’t have to tell customers who your competitors are. It’s assumed! You don’t have to list every feature, because it’s assumed that all products in the category have basic category functions. However, a poor category choice can turn that power against a product. If the market category we select triggers assumptions that do not apply to our product, then a good portion of our marketing and sales efforts are going to be spent battling those assumptions.
	  •   (Bonus) Relevant trends.
	    1.  Trends that your target customers understand and/or are interested in that can help make your product more relevant right now.
	    2.  Used carefully, trends can help customers understand why your offering is something they need to pay attention to right now. It’s easy to confuse market categories and trends, but they are not the same thing. Market categories are a collection of products with similar characteristics. Trends are more like a characteristic itself, but one that happens to be very new and noteworthy at a given point in time. Market categories help customers understand what your offering is all about and why they should care. Trends help buyers understand why this product is important to them right now.

		- **Note**: The document discusses how to nail product positioning so customers get it, buy it, and love it. It explains that the target market needs to be identified by their characteristics, and the market category needs to be declared in order to set assumptions in customers' minds about the product's functionality, competitors and pricing. Additionally, relevant trends can be used to make the product more relevant to the customers.
	- Your best-fit customers hold the key to understanding what your product is. The first step in the positioning exercise is to make a short list of your best customers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrgjn6c540km7ese6qmen4q))
	- List Your True Competitive Alternatives
	  
	  1.  The features of our product and the value they provide are only unique, interesting and valuable when a customer perceives them in relation to alternatives.
	  2.  Understanding the customer’s problem wasn’t enough—to really understand how they perceived our strengths and weaknesses, we needed to understand the alternatives to which they compared us. Customers always group solutions in categories, but talking to them about problems doesn’t necessarily reveal those categories.
	  3.  Focus on your best customers and what they would identify as alternative solutions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrgtmtdtwk9271a68q02bat))
		- **Note**: This section discusses the importance of understanding the customer's problem and alternative solutions when positioning a product. It emphasizes the need to focus on the customer's best solutions and what they would identify as an alternative.
	- Isolate Your Unique Attributes or Features
	  
	  1.  Strong positioning is centered on what a product does best. Once you have a list of competitive alternatives, the next step is to isolate what makes you different and better than those alternatives.
	  2.  In this step, list all of the capabilities you have that the alternatives do not.
	  3.  Ease of use is another “feature” that I believe is really a value. What is it about your product that makes it easier to use and how do you prove it? Do your competitors’ products require training and your product doesn’t? Can you quantify how long it takes to become proficient with your product versus alternative products?
	  4.  Concentrate on “consideration” rather than “retention” attributes. Consideration attributes are things that customers care about when they are evaluating whether or not to make a purchase. Every product has features that you can connect directly to a goal the customer would like to accomplish right now. Retention attributes are features that aren’t as important when a customer is making an initial purchase decision, but are very important when it comes time to renew. These include how easy it is to do business with a company and the quality of customer support. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrgsf5nskawg8pvg2g689me))
		- **Note**: This section of the document explains how to identify a product's unique attributes or features in order to create strong positioning. It suggests listing all capabilities that the competitive alternatives do not have and emphasizing consideration attributes (things that customers care about when evaluating a purchase) rather than retention attributes (features that are less important when making an initial purchase decision, but more important when it comes time to renew). Ease of use is also recommended to be emphasized, with possible quantifying of how long it takes to become proficient with the product.
	- Map the Attributes to Value “Themes”
	  
	  1.  Articulating value takes the benefits one step further: putting benefits into the context of a goal the customer is trying to achieve. Value could be “photos that are sharp even when printed or zoomed in,” “a frame that saves you money on replacements,”
	  2.  Features enable benefits, which can be translated into value in unique customer terms.
	  3.  Feature: Something your product does or has Benefit: What the feature enables for customers Value: How this feature maps to a goal the customer is trying to achieve 15-megapixel camera Sharp photo images Images can be zoomed in or printed in large format and still look sharp. All-metal construction A stronger frame that resists damage The frame lasts five times longer, allowing savings of $50,000 per year on frame replacements.

	  4.  In positioning a product, we’re taking the most critical things that make us special and worth considering, and bringing the resulting unique value to the front and center. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrgqvmgh4jtjxn93b7dqwck))
		- **Note**: This document outlines how to effectively position a product for customers. It explains that features enable benefits and that those benefits should be articulated in terms of the customer's goal. It then provides an example of how a feature can be translated into a benefit and value for a customer. Finally, the document states that positioning involves taking the most important elements that make a product unique and bringing them to the forefront.
	- Determine Who Cares a Lot
	  
	  1.  Target as narrowly as you can to meet your near-term sales objectives. You can broaden the targets later.
	  2.  I’ve found that this step tends to be either the easiest or the most difficult to work through. You are mapping the value that your product’s features deliver to a group of customers who have the highest affinity for your product. You need to focus on the value points that you listed in the previous step and repeat the question, Who cares and why? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrgrrh30rtsrchj2r2jegd8))
		- **Note**: This document outlines the importance of narrowing down the target audience for a product in order to meet near-term sales objectives. It emphasizes the importance of focusing on the value points of the product and asking "Who cares and why?" in order to identify the group of customers with the highest affinity for the product.
	- In the context of this exercise, a “market” needs to be something that already exists in the minds of customers (except in the very rare case where you make a conscious decision to create a new market—which we’ll discuss later in this step). We position our offering in a market to trigger a set of assumptions—about competitors, features and pricing—that work to our advantage. By choosing to position within a specific market, you’re giving your prospects clues about what products they should compare you with, your key features, your price and your benefits. Those comparisons help customers quickly figure out what your product is all about and whether or not they should consider purchasing it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrgk198kced4rrchp7snsk1))
		- **Note**: Product positioning is essential in order to make customers aware of a product and to give them an idea of what they should expect from it. By positioning a product within a specific market, prospects are given clues about the product's competitors, features, price, and benefits. This helps customers decide whether the product is something they might want to purchase.
	- Use abductive reasoning. The adage “if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck” also applies to new products. With abductive reasoning, you choose a market category by isolating your key features and their value, and asking yourself, What types of products typically have those features? What category of products typically deliver that value? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrgm026pmt04nxbqzq46f68))
		- **Note**: "When you are trying to decide which market category your product belongs to, you can use something called 'abductive reasoning'. This means that you look at the features of your product and ask yourself: 'What do other products have that are similar to my product?'. That way you can figure out which market category your product belongs to."
	- Pay particular attention to adjacent markets that are growing quickly. Positioning yourself in a growing market has obvious benefits: a rising tide of customer interest, media focus and buzz, and the appearance of being new and cool—who doesn’t want that? But be careful—simply wanting to belong in a market doesn’t make it the right one for you. Only choose a market if it makes your strengths obvious. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrgke11dgr63718yvf4em7p))
	- The goal of the Big Fish, Small Pond style of positioning is to carve off a piece of the market where the rules are a little bit different—just enough to give your product an edge over the category leader. Like the Head to Head style of positioning, here you are leveraging what buyers already know about the broader market category, but you are calling attention to the fact that some of the requirements for your chosen subsegments are different and not being met by the overall category leader.
