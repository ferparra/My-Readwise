	- The American Cancer Society and American Lung Association in 1981 devoted just under $300,000 to research; that same year, the tobacco industry gave $6.3 million. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcf8j6x2jh6wd034yf3ezqr))
	- Jealousy does not always cause quarrels, but it very often does. Smoking does not kill everyone who smokes, but it does kill about half of them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcf98qd2mb1tjnhwrdgftye))
	- Doubt is crucial to science—in the version we call curiosity or healthy skepticism, it drives science forward—but it also makes science vulnerable to misrepresentation, because it is easy to take uncertainties out of context and create the impression that everything is unresolved.

	- One Jason recalls being asked by colleagues, “When you go to Washington and tell them that the CO2 will double in 50 years and will have major impacts on the planet, what do they say?” His reply? “They … ask me to come back in forty-nine years.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcg2jvhxj1pfczat4wjzj00))
	- Climate change wouldn’t produce new kinds of climate, Schelling argued, but would simply change the distribution of climatic zones on Earth.

Those who find this hard to accept attack the messenger, which is science. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcg47a7d9s9j5wg74akw7g2))
