document_note:: This text from "Free to Choose: A Personal Statement" argues that consumer freedoms have been eroded by government regulations and economic controls, and that restoring these freedoms is essential for the US to remain competitive and continue to move forward. It discusses the importance of laissez faire, the invisible hand, and competition, as well as the fallacy of equal outcome and the importance of free trade. It also suggests that the Great Depression was caused by the government mishandling money, and that public ambition should not take away from private ambition. Finally, it argues against tariffs, nationalization and central planning, and welfare, in favor of voluntary exchange and philanthropy.
