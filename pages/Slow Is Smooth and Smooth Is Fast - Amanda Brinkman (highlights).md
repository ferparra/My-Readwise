	- Slow Is Smooth and Smooth Is Fast
	- I love this phrase. It’s from the U.S. Navy Seals. It’s a reminder that the best way to move fast in a professional setting is to take your time, slow down, and do the job right. Start with a deep breath.Take another. Consider your options. And then move. Slow, smooth, fast.
