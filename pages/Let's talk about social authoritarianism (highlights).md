document_note:: Social authoritarianism is a form of low-rung thinking where one's own ideas are imposed on others. It consists of non-authoritarians, social bullies, and idea supremacists. Non-authoritarians don't enforce their way of thinking, while social bullies get angry or offended with those who disagree, and idea supremacists believe disagreeing ideas are so dangerous they must be silenced. Criticism attacks ideas, while cancel culture attacks people, which silences discussion. To be a liberal means to push back against idea supremacy. Extreme cases where everyone rejects an idea are not idea supremacy, but when a powerful group imposes their rules on everyone else, this is idea supremacy.
