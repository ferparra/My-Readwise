	- üßµOn solutions.
	  
	  If your ‚Äúsolution‚Äù generates a situation objectively worse than existed before it was implemented: it is no solution. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ToKTeacher/status/1628149344036859916))

	- All solutions reveal new problems. But to *be* solutions they must be better problems: more interesting, lead to less suffering, greater wealth, more happiness, more powerful technology, more rapid progress and so on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ToKTeacher/status/1628149369559199747))
	- Rapid progress causes problems but these are far better problems than caused by slow progress, or no progress or regression. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ToKTeacher/status/1628149371924787205))
	- If your ‚Äúsolution‚Äù calls for slowing progress: *it is no solution*. While there is no guarantee of success, slowing progress is a guarantee (eventually) of failure. How to maintain stable but rapid progress is the master problem: https://t.co/caxDLd17OC ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ToKTeacher/status/1628149373350850579))
	- Malthusians, those calling for smaller human populations, those seeking restrictions on industry, rapid wealth creators and risk takers, those who cast people as consumers not producers and the past as idyllic and the present polluted: they are calling for problem exacerbation.

	- Naysayers and pessimists may use ‚Äúsolution‚Äù sounding language but their prescriptions are anything but. Anytime someone calls for a halt to progress or regression to a time before industrial solutions that brought us modern society hear them calling for worse problem situations.

	- Anytime someone highlights all their fears and claimed-dangers of new and emerging tech while utterly ignoring upsides both potential and real: see through all the grand claims to the dark kernel at the core: pessimism, anti-humanism, stasis and death.

	- The prophets and pessimists have always been with us. They used to be easier to spot in their bright religious garb: now too often they are cloaked in lab coats (or the academic equivalent). But it‚Äôs the same old story: humans are bringing ruin upon themselves: the end is nigh! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ToKTeacher/status/1628149385745018886))
	- Happily Optimism overcomes Pessimism. No sophisticated philosophical arguments need to be made because: science works. Technology works. Progress works. *Things are getting better*. The past was awful in comparison. Life is an opportunity and we can and do make the world better. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ToKTeacher/status/1628149388282572804))
	- Genuine solutions that have generated rapid progress abound. Cheap, bountiful energy & resources, technology, vast cities, bigger, healthier, wealthier populations: all monuments to genuine solutions and refutations of false ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù that call for us to slow down and regulate.
