	  Compressing a 6-year career into the best 8 ideas: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1391824470977941516))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1. Contrast Is A Drug
	  
	  â€¢ Rolls Royce stopped exhibiting at car shows
	  
	  â€¢ They started exhibiting at private aircraft shows
	  
	  â€¢ "If you've been looking at jets all afternoon, a Â£300,000 car is an impulse buy. It's like putting the sweets next to the counter" - @rorysutherland ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1391824473779752964))
	- 2. The Best Content Involves A Red Pill 
	  
	  â€¢ "If you want to build a good podcast, following, or blog - you've gotta create your red pill"
	  
	  â€¢ Hand society something they're not hearing anywhere
	  
	  â€¢ Society says blue pill. Your content says red pill.

	- â€¢ The irony is that the red pill metaphor is itself a red pill - once you see it, you can never unsee it. 
	  
	  â€¢ The best content creators on the internet all have their own red pill, which makes their content so enticing. 
	  
	  E.g. @jockowillink's red pill:

	- â€¢ Society's Blue Pill: Writing is a boring activity from school
	  
	  â€¢ @david_perell's Red Pill: Writing online is the fastest way to accelerate your career

	- â€¢ Society's Blue Pill = Trust the traditional finance system
	  
	  â€¢ @APompliano's Red Pill = Blockchain is the future

	- 3. The Law Of Shitty Clickthroughs
	  
	  â€¢ The first banner ad ever had a clickthrough rate of 78%. 
	  
	  â€¢ In 2021, the average varies between 0.05%-0.16%.  
	  
	  â€¢ "Over time, all marketing strategies result in shitty clickthrough rates." - @andrewchen ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1391824564578099204))
	- â€¢ Most of the rewards of marketing channels go to early adopters
	  
	  GymShark = Used influencer marketing before the term existed
	  
	  PayPal = Used "Earn $ for signing up" before the term existed
	  
	  Go fast. Entropy will occur - and only the wealthy can afford to keep playing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1391824567627309060))
	- 4. The Most Underrated Marketing Channel
	  
	  â€¢ "Your unboxing experience is the only marketing channel with a 100% open rate." - @TaylorHoliday 
	  
	  â€¢ When I first read this, I felt like such a moron. 
	  
	  â€¢ I'd spent years neglecting the most important marketing channel. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1391824573683863553))
	- @TaylorHoliday has a fantastic "3 M framework" for unboxing: 
	  
	  1. Mission - Help customers understand why you exist 
	  
	  2. Magic - Unexpected moment that delights the customer
	  
	  3. Money - How do we turn them into a repeat purchase or referral ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1391824576217292808))
	- 5. Weird > Average 
	  
	  â€¢ If you optimize for the mean, you optimize for nobody. 
	  
	  â€¢ The average person doesn't exist - it's just a blended mean of 7 billion people. 
	  
	  â€¢ If you design an idea for them, you design an idea for nobody. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1391824578721329155))
	- â€¢ In contrast, if you design for the extremes - it can then cross over to the mainstream. 
	  
	  E.g. 
	  
	  TikTok 2016 = Lip Syncing for teenagers 
	  TikTok 2021 = Global short form video platform
	  
	  GymShark 2012 = Vests for gym bro's 
	  GymShark 2021 = Fitness attire for everyone ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1391824580986261512))
	- 6. Costly Signalling Theory 
	  
	  â€¢ "The most efficient way to send a wedding invitation would be by email." - @rorysutherland 
	  
	  â€¢ A beautiful handwritten invitation by post contains the same message as an email - but the cost and effort signals how serious you are
	  
	  Contrast below:

	- 7. Linear Commerce - The Merging Of Media and Commerce
	  
	  â€¢ "Brands will develop publishing as a core competency, and publishers will develop retail operations as a core competency". - @web 
	  
	  â€¢  This foresight from @web will be looked back upon like "software is eating the world" 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1DBHNUXoAcTUzo.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1391824621993922564))
	- You can already see this playing out... 
	  
	  â€¢ Nelk Boys + Logan Paul launching 8 figure clothing brands organically.
	  
	  â€¢ @balajis idea of a "founding influencer" to enhance distribution. 
	  
	  â€¢ Hubspot acquiring The Hustle. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1391824628620926989))
	- â€¢ Paid advertising is just acquiring attention
	  
	  â€¢ If there's an organic media machine that acquires attention for free, they rely less on paid advertising
	  
	  â€¢ And if the organic media machine ever uses paid advertising, it's miles cheaper (I've seen this on so many ad accounts) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1391824631976402945))
	- 8. Simplify 
	  
	  â€¢ "The more you simplify, the better people will perform. People cannot understand and keep a track of a long complicated set of initiatives...
	  
	  Use a framework people can repeat without thinking about." - @rabois 
	  
	  You can change the world through a sentence...
