	- The 101 track will be relatively basic.
	  
	  I’m a strong believer in both understanding fundamentals and in helping onboard beginners!
	  
	  But I plan on doing 201, 301, and 401 next to build a series of stepping stones to become a pro AI developer. 
	  
	  Part 2 (prompts) drops tomorrow. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1656462705086312448))
	- I’ll also be trying to leverage my Twitter Subscriptions page for office hours.
