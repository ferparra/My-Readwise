	- Performance reviews are coming up. A *lot* of these reviews will be biased, esp from managers who are not aware of biases existing, and not actively countering them.

	- One more: the contrasting/comparing bias. I have to stop myself so many times from doing this.
	  
	  This bias is a key trigger in putting career ladders together, like the ones listed on https://t.co/qHiANRp3Y7 E.g. the one from Brandwatch by @jstanier: https://t.co/PYdvos3owj
