- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Apr 7th, 2023]]
	- The philosophy of history is rarely studied, which is why plenty of academic history is a waste of time
	  
	  •   According to Niall, you can’t be a historian without a philosophy of history and an understanding of the nature of causation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22p50nrsahy6hf3exzrgbb))
	- **“History’s not a science. It can’t be a science because we can’t rerun events in a laboratory and see if, consistently, war breaks out in 1939 with or without Hitler.”** – *Niall Ferguson* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22ph70z72zv36sa6f1v3rb))
	- Writing the history of the Rothschild family back in the 1990s
	  
	  •   Reading through dusty old letters that the Rothschild brothers wrote to one another
	  •   They cast an entirely new light on the 19th Century, and they were altogether absorbing
	  •   The eldest of the Rothschild brothers, Amschel, described what it was like for the first time to own land – he bought a garden and slept in it
	  •   Before the upheavals caused by the French revolution, Jews had not been allowed to own real estate
	  •   He’d slept outdoors for the first time in a garden he owned
	  •   Niall was moved to tears when he found out about it
	  •   He remembered the moment in Beethoven’s “Fidelio,” when the prisoners sing how it feels to be in the open air. It indeed was appropriate music for that moment
	  •   Listening to Beethoven and thinking about the letter, he realized that the letter was an enormously important document (meaning of emancipation) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22r0v0fc5tscwefeytnp45))
	- The best historians can make you empathize with the dead despite the difference in time, space, and experience ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22rcyqe8fb28bqr5hpm5v6))
	- **Historical contingency – a relatively small event or decision can have significant consequences**
	  
	  •   Historical causations can have tremendous ramifications, no matter how small they are ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22rnzwhezkgbsv11rz8ez1))
	- **According to Niall, one of the most exciting things about studying history is reminding ourselves that what happened might have gone the other way**
	  
	  •   The Cuban Missile Crisis could have easily resulted in World War III
	  •   Historians need to be aware of these alternate worlds and avoid the mistake of writing like all these events were already predetermined
	  •   A deterministic view of the historical process quickly leads to fatalism
	  •   Nobody knew that Zelenskyy would stand his ground ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22s5qrpws6sqsemh9bvesy))
	- **“It’s the notes you don’t play.”** – *Thelonious Monk* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22sdvqx36s83tfz9c2gq83))
		- **Tags**: #[[quotes]]
	- **“If you zoom too far out and just view history as these inevitable tectonic plates, then there’s a fatalism that can set in, and you throw up your hands and move on to just staring at TikTok all day or whatever you might do. And at the same time, if you bleed into the conspiracy theory side of things, same outcome.”** – *Tim Ferriss* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22szpcdc0em0pk3z2bgbvr))
	- **Taiwan seems to be worth more than its territorial size would suggest. Taiwan’s more important than Cuba ever was because Taiwan is where TSMC manufactures 92% of the most sophisticated semiconductors in the world**
	  
	  •   According to Niall, the potential for a crisis over Taiwan is higher than the potential ever was for a crisis over Cuba
	  •   “So I think what happens next is that we end up with a showdown over Taiwan at some point in the next few years. Could be in 2024 when there’s an election scheduled in Taiwan.” – *Niall Ferguson* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22tz309pd81811rr943t0r))
	- A crucial aspect was encouraging his team to disagree when they thought he was wrong ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22wwe0gaq8t6f90jqhdbw3))
	- Parents need to make a concentrated effort to make sure their kids get into the habit of reading books ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22vndj9cs7n9vtsv4nj4z8))
	- **“The relationship you have with your children is more important than anything else. And on your tombstone, it doesn’t say “wrote 150 emails a day, or closed X deals,” or it doesn’t say “published 16 books.” That’s not what the gravestones say. They talk about whether you were a good son, whether you were a good husband and whether you were a good father.”** – *Niall Ferguson* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22vwazehc0k4crnwyj90n3))
	- [*Dominion*](https://www.amazon.com/Dominion-Christian-Revolution-Remade-World/dp/0465093507) by Tom Holland
	  
	  •   Although we think we are secular, we are still a Christian society
	  •   Everything gets embellished by Christian beliefs – issues like climate change, fears of the apocalypse-the millenarian mindset is deeply rooted in Christianity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22w9904ema81r89m48bp3y))
	- **“If you can use the Bible as a way of helping your children find their way to being good, then I think that’s to be encouraged, even if you were as skeptical as I am about the existence of God, the possibility of an afterlife, all the rest of it.”** – *Niall Ferguson* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx22wm1vjfdsk2zssykyg8jx))
