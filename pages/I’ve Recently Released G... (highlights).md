- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Dec 1st, 2022]]
	- Iâ€™ve recently released gpu-io â€“â€“ a WebGL computing library for real-time physics simulations, particle/agent-based systems, cellular automata, image processing, and general purpose GPU computations.
	  
	  Examples: https://t.co/ricQ98ci8K
	  Code: https://t.co/Q97eyb1xKT

	- gpu-io makes it easy to build GPU-accelerated applications without worrying about low-level WebGL details and browser inconsistencies.
	  
	  Iâ€™m using this as the basis for all of my shader experiments, including the fluid/marbling work Iâ€™ve been up to lately:

	- gpu-io has built-in helper functions for composing real-time physics simulations â€“â€“ e.g. for applying boundary conditions, flip-flopping prev/next state buffers, rendering particles, and adding touch interactivity.
	  
	  interactive Physarum (slime mold) sim:

	- gpu-io plays nicely with @threejs â€“â€“ data can be passed between the two libraries via WebGL textures without ever leaving the GPU.

	- gpu-io is designed for WebGL 2 with fallbacks to convert your shader code to run in WebGL 1 if needed â€“â€“ so it should run on practically any mobile or older browser.  You can try all of the examples with WebGL 1 to test:

	  WebGPU support is planned!

	- Had fun putting together the example docs for this repo. Hereâ€™s a zoomable Julia set fractal demo:

	  You can zoom until you run out of float precision to calculate the image. Would be cool to make this infinitely zoom via self-similarity tricks... https://t.co/6NvzuChWF6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandaghassaei/status/1597962090492239877))
	- More examples from the slime mold (Physarum) simulation:

	  This one is a mix of grid + particle methods â€“â€“ lots of little agents interacting with an underlying field of chemo-attractants.
	  
	  Inspired by the incredible work of @mxsage:

	- Reaction-diffusion system whose behavior depends on two parameters that vary across x and y. Zoom around parameter space to find regions of interest:

	  Most of the dynamic behavior occurs in a small sliver of parameter space, but it's fun to look around! https://t.co/NMy69HyzD7 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandaghassaei/status/1597964712196853760))
