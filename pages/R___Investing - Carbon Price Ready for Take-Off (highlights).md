	- The EU carbon market works on a 'cap and trade' principle. A 'cap' is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases, and companies receive buy or sell allowances. Heavy polluters buy allowances from cleaner companies.

	- Carbon prices rose in 2020 despite a 14% fall in emissions because the carbon market is in a deficit. They fell around the same time as the March sell-off, but recovered once vaccines were announced, and rose further in December when EU leaders agreed to more ambitious emissions reduction targets
	- Every year, the EU reduces the total number of allowances by 1.47%.
	- In 2015, the EU established a mechanism known as the Market Stability Reserve (MRS) to remove surplus allowances.
	- Andurand Capital Management, which successfully bet on oil prices after the 2020 crash, expects that carbon will "hit 100 Euros ($121) per metric ton of carbon emissions, possibly as soon as later this year". If their forecasts are accurate, we'd see prices rise 160% above current levels.
	- "Do not give up in disgust or impatience if you do not find action on the right principles consolidated into action in all that you do. No: if you have taken a fall come back again, and be glad if most of your actions are on the right side of humanity." Book 5, Verse 9
