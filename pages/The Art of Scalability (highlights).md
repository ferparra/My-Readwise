document_note:: 1. What key strategies can be used to prevent scalability issues? 
2. What are the tradeoffs between scalability and high availability? 
3. How can I effectively organize my personnel to ensure scalability?

A good vision statement should have a vivid description of an ideal future, be important to value creation, be measurable, be inspirational, incorporate elements of your beliefs, be mostly static but modifiable as the need presents itself, and be easily remembered.

The factors that determine the size of a team include the experience level of the managers, the tenure of team members in the company and in the engineering field, the managerial duties that must be handled, and the needs of the business. Additionally, the output of the organization can be affected by both individual output and team size, so efficiency should also be taken into consideration.

The Art of Scalability outlines the importance of scalability processes in organizations, and how to balance scalability and high availability with the right processes. It discusses the roles and responsibilities of the people involved, the need to create reports that show availability over time, the business case for scalability initiatives, and the use of multiple axes of scalability. Additionally, it goes into the details of implementing processes to ensure higher levels of repeatability between teams, and the need to factor in cost-effectively scaling systems and guaranteeing high availability.

	- In general, we like to think of management activities as “pushing” activities and
	  leadership as “pulling” activities. Leadership sets a destination and “waypoints”
	  toward that destination. Management then gets you to that destination. Leadership
	  would be stating, “We will never have a scalability-related downtime in our systems”;
	  management would be ensuring that this scenario never happens. Every company
	  absolutely needs both management and leadership, and needs to do both well. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvc3z0azrm7bqk7g4d5hd0bz))

	- • People are the most important piece of the scale puzzle.
	  • The right person in the right job at the right time and with the right behaviors
	  is essential to scale organizations, processes, and systems.
	  • Organizational structures are rarely “right or wrong.” Any structure is likely to
	  have pros and cons relative to your needs.
	  • When designing your organization, consider the following points:
	  ○
	  The ease with which additional units of work can be added to the organiza-
	  tion. How easily can you add or remove people to/from this organization?
	  Do you need to add them in groups, or can you add individual people?
	  ○
	  The ease with which you can measure organizational success and individual
	  contributions over time.
	  ○
	  How easily goals can be assigned and owned by groups, and whether the
	  groups will feel empowered to deliver these goals.
	  ○
	  How conflict will emerge within and between groups, and whether it will
	  help or hinder the company mission.
	  ○ How the structure will help or hinder both innovation and time to market.
	  ○
	  How the organizational structure will increase or decrease the cost per unit
	  of value created.
	  ○ How easily work flows through the organization.
	  • Adding people to organizations may increase the organizational throughput,
	  but the average production per individual tends to decline.
	  • Management is about achieving goals. A lack of management is nearly certain
	  to doom your scalability initiatives.
	  • Leadership is about goal definition, vision creation, and mission articulation.
	  An absence of leadership as it relates to scale is detrimental to your objectives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcv6y43973ta0pwdfnynr4m))
	- • Organizational structure can either hinder or help a team’s ability to produce
	  and support scalable applications.
	  • Team size and team structure are the two key attributes with regard to
	  organizations.
	  • Teams that are too small do not provide enough capacity to accomplish the
	  priorities of the business.
	  • Teams that are too large can cause a loss of productivity and degrade morale.
	  • The two traditional organizational structures are functional and matrix.
	  • Functional organizational structures provide benefits such as commonality of
	  management and peers, simplicity of responsibilities, ease of task assignment,
	  and greater adherence to standards.
	  • Matrix organizational structures provide benefits such as project ownership
	  and improved cross-team communication.
	  • Agile Organization structures, especially those aligned to services and archi-
	  tecture, provide increased innovation as measured by faster time to market,
	  higher-quality functionality, and higher availability of services. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcv6mej3sh54y5t01jkre36))
	- There is simply no place for a big ego in any position within any company. Certainly,
	  there is a high degree of correlation between passionate inspirational leaders and
	  people who have a need to talk about how great, intelligent, or successful they are.
	  We would argue, however, that those people would be even more successful if they kept
	  their need for publicity or public recognition to themselves. The concept isn’t new; in
	  fact, it is embodied in Jim Collins’s concept of Level 5 Leadership in his wonderful
	  book Good to Great. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvc49870zqwq57rnhm3jk1jy))
	- The best leaders give of themselves selflessly in an ethical pursuit of creating
	  shareholder value. The right way to approach your job as a leader and a manager is
	  to figure out how to get the most out of your team so as to maximize shareholder
	  wealth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvc49qyvs8gwyx61bbg049nn))
	- Take some time to evaluate yourself and your statements through the course of
	  a week. Identify how many times you reference yourself or your accomplishments
	  during your daily discussions. If you find that you are doing it often, step back and
	  redirect your thoughts and your statements to things that are more team oriented
	  than self-oriented. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvc4a1pb6a9q63rh73e5agza))
	- Transformational leadership simply scales better. Rather than focusing on trans-
	  actions with individuals, it focuses on the team. Rather than emphasizing oneself,
	  it discusses the greater good. What might otherwise become a discussion with a
	  single individual now becomes a discussion about what the team should aspire to be
	  and accomplish. Whereas transactional leaders focus on the completion of individ-
	  ual tasks and goals, transformational leaders concentrate on presenting a compelling
	  vision that pulls individuals to the right results even when the leader isn’t present.
	  In addition, transformational leadership has been shown to reduce affective con-
	  flict (the bad role-based conflict described earlier in this book) and increase value-
	  creating cognitive conflict.5 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvctmvstjfnc4nmpeg6fg4rb))
	- Your vision is your destination; it’s
	  something that should inspire people within your company, attract outside talent,
	  help retain the best of your current talent, and help people understand what they
	  should be doing in the absence of a manager standing over their shoulders. Y ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvctnqs0p2dx993khpqkcg8n))
	- We suggest that you research other statements of vision and use the rules we have
	  identified before creating your own. Apply these rules or tests and figure out which
	  ones work for you. As a reminder, a vision statement should meet the following
	  criteria:
	  • Vivid description of an ideal future
	  • Important to value creation
	  • Measurable
	  • Inspirational
	  • Incorporate elements of your beliefs
	  • Mostly static, but modifiable as the need presents itself
	  • Easily remembered ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvctr1dx9e0axy1n6tzttq55))
	- Like a vision statement, the mission
	  statement should also be testable. The test for the mission statement should include
	  the determination of whether, if properly executed, the mission statement will help
	  drive the initiative, organization, or company toward the vision of the company. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcttsjd8as20g0sw8f4xc6c))
	- As a review, a mission statement should meet the following criteria:
	  • Be descriptive of the present state and actions.
	  • Incorporate a sense of purpose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcts85zecexz4nxdjdydhry))
	- • Be measurable.
	  • Include a general direction or path toward the vision. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcts9qmqs6b320pnmp2b6rp))
	- SMART goals are
	  • Specific
	  • Measurable
	  • Attainable (but aggressive)
	  • Realistic
	  • Timely (or contain a component of time) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvctv1andwk5a550ekj3cghv))
	- One of the best and easiest things you can do as a leader to help ensure success
	  within an organization is help people understand how what they do every day con-
	  tributes to the vision of the organization and, as a result, to the creation of share-
	  holder value. We call this creation of understanding the causal roadmap to success.
	  The causal roadmap is relatively easy to create for people, and if it isn’t, there is a
	  good reason to question whether the job should exist. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvctwcr504pasa95nt6ctf54))
	- Leadership is the influencing of an organization or person to accomplish a specific
	  objective. Our mental model for thinking about leadership is a function consisting
	  of personal characteristics, skills, experiences, and actions. Becoming a better leader
	  starts with knowing where you are weak and where you are strong within the leader-
	  ship function.
	  Leadership can impact the scalability of your team and your company in many
	  ways. Poor leadership puts limits on the growth and output of your company and
	  your team. Great leadership, in contrast, serves as an accelerator for growth, allow-
	  ing organizations to grow in total size and in output per individual. By becoming a
	  better leader, you can increase the capabilities and capacity of your organization and
	  your company.
	  Successful leaders are characterized by certain behaviors, including leading by
	  example, leaving your ego at the door, leading selflessly, and accomplishing the mis-
	  sion while taking care of your team. Leaders who focus on the greater good (trans-
	  formational leadership), rather than engaging in transactions with their employees,
	  generally get better results. For all these reasons, you should always be thinking of
	  how to lead ethically and recognize that everything you do should be aligned with
	  shareholder value.

	- • Leadership is influencing the behavior of an organization or a person to accom-
	  plish a specific objective.
	  • Leaders, whether born or made, can get better; in fact, the pursuit of getting
	  better should be a lifelong goal.
	  • Leadership can be viewed as a function consisting of personal characteristics,
	  skills, experiences, actions, and approaches. Increasing any aspect increases
	  your leadership “quotient.”
	  • The first step in getting better as a leader is to know where you stand. To do so,
	  get a 360-degree review from your employees, your peers, and your manager.
	  • Lead as you would have people follow—abide by the culture you wish to create.
	  • There is no place for ego when leading teams—so check your ego at the door.
	  • Leadership should be a selfless endeavor.
	  • Mission First, People Always. Get the job done on time, but ensure you are
	  doing it while taking care of your people.
	  • Always be morally straight. What you allow, you teach, and what you teach
	  becomes your standard.
	  • Align everything you do with shareholder value. Don’t do things that don’t cre-
	  ate shareholder value.
	  • Transformational leaders focus on the team overall, not on individuals. Don’t
	  engage in leadership transactions with individuals (quid pro quo), but rather
	  focus the team on collaboration and team outcomes.
	  • Vision is a vivid description of an ideal future. It includes the following
	  components:
	  ○
	  Vivid description of an ideal future
	  ○ Important to shareholder value creation
	  ○ Measurable
	  ○ Inspirational
	  ○ Incorporate elements of your beliefs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcty1hc7vqn6msw2ms1e3kp))
	- ○ Mostly static, but modifiable as the need presents itself
	  ○ Easily remembered
	  • Mission is the general path or actions that will get you to your vision. It includes
	  the following components:
	  ○
	  Descriptive of the present state and actions
	  ○ A sense of purpose
	  ○ Measurable
	  ○ General direction or path toward the vision
	  • Goals are the guideposts to your vision and are consistent with the path of your
	  mission. SMART goals are
	  ○
	  Specific
	  ○ Measurable
	  ○ Attainable (but aggressive)
	  ○ Realistic
	  ○ Timely (or contain a component of time)
	  • The causal roadmap to success will help you frame your vision, mission, and
	  goals, and will help employees understand how they contribute to those goals
	  and aid in the creation of shareholder value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvctxy7tgcqckff38rrryzq6))
	- • Incidents are issues in the production environment. Incident management is the
	  process focused on timely and cost-effective restoration of service in the pro-
	  duction environment.
	  • Problems are the cause of incidents. Problem management is the process focused
	  on determining root cause of and correcting problems.
	  • Incidents can be managed using the acronym DRIER, which stands for detect,
	  report, investigate, escalate, and resolve.
	  • There is a natural tension between incident and problem management. Rapid
	  restoration of service may cause some forensic information to be lost that would
	  otherwise be useful in problem management. Thinking through how much time
	  should be allowed to collect data and which data should be collected will help
	  ease this tension for any given incident.
	  • Incidents and problems should have defined life cycles. For example, an inci-
	  dent may be opened, resolved, and closed, whereas a problem may be open,
	  identified, and closed.
	  • A daily incident meeting should be organized to review incidents and problem
	  status, assign owners, and assign meaningful business categorizations.
	  • A quarterly incident review is an opportunity to look back at past incidents and
	  problems so as to validate proper first-time closure of problems and themati-
	  cally analyze both problems and incidents to help prioritize scalability-related
	  architecture, process, and organization work.
	  • The postmortem process is a brainstorming process used for large incidents
	  and problems to help drive their closure and identify supporting tasks.
	  • Postmortems should always focus on the identification of multiple causes (prob-
	  lems) for any incident. These causes may address all dimensions of the product
	  development process: people, process, and technology. Ideally, the output of the
	  postmortem will identify how to avoid such an incident in the future, how to
	  detect the incident more quickly, and how to drive to incident resolution faster. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcv7ca19yar0hgfyrne1zr5))
	- Crises are incidents on steroids that can either make your company stronger or
	  kill your business. Crises, if not managed aggressively, will destroy your com-
	  pany’s ability to scale its customers, its organizational structure, and its tech-
	  nology platform and services.
	  • To resolve crises as quickly and cost-effectively as possible, you must contain
	  the chaos with some measure of order.
	  • The leaders who are most effective in crises are calm on the inside but capable
	  of forcing and maintaining order throughout the crisis management process.
	  They must have business acumen and technical experience and be calm leaders
	  under pressure.
	  • The crisis resolution team consists of the crisis manager, engineering managers,
	  and senior engineers. In addition, teams of engineers reporting to the engineer-
	  ing managers are employed.
	  • The role of the crisis manager is to maintain order and follow the crisis resolu-
	  tion, escalation, and communication processes.
	  • The role of the engineering manager is to manage her team and provide status
	  to the crisis resolution team.
	  • The role of the senior engineer from each engineering team is to help the crisis
	  resolution team create and vet hypotheses regarding cause and to help deter-
	  mine the most appropriate rapid resolution approaches.
	  • The role of the individual contributor engineer is to participate in his team and
	  identify rapid resolution approaches, create and evaluate hypotheses about the
	  cause of the crisis, and provide status information to his manager on the crisis
	  resolution team. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcv687830rgqytc43v8awf9))
	- • Communication between crisis resolution team members should happen face
	  to face in a crisis resolution or war room; when face-to-face communication
	  isn’t possible, the team should use a conference bridge on a phone. A chat room
	  should also be employed.
	  • War rooms, which are ideally sited adjacent to operations centers, should be
	  developed to help resolve crisis situations.
	  • Escalations and status communications should be defined during a crisis. After
	  a crisis, the crisis process should provide status updates at periodic intervals
	  until all root causes are identified and fixed.
	  • Crisis postmortems should be vigorous examinations that identify and manage
	  a series of follow-ups in the form of subordinate postmortems that thematically
	  attack all issues identified in the master postmortem. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcv6a92zzcpzvjq4vjag3hb))
	- Agile Organizations, in
	  contrast, break down the organizational boundaries that functional organizations
	  struggle with and empower the teams, eliminating the problem that matrix organi-
	  zations face. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcv480ada25e7g5vt3cag67))
	- Agile Organizations are 5- to 12-person teams made up of personnel with the
	  skill sets necessary to design, develop, deliver, and support a product or service for
	  customers. These teams are cross-functional (multidisciplinary) and self-contained.
	  They are empowered to make their own decisions without seeking approval from
	  people outside their teams. They are capable of handling the full life cycle of their
	  products or services. When teams are aligned by services, are autonomous, and are
	  cross-functionally composed, there is a significant decrease in affective conflict.
	  When team members are aligned by shared goals and no longer need to argue about
	  who is responsible or who should perform certain tasks, the team wins or loses
	  together. Everyone on the team is responsible for ensuring the service provided meets
	  the business goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcv4gepqjkme7m3spx0z21p))
	- We know that experiential, network, and skill set diversity allows individuals to
	  develop better solutions to problems—and architecting a feature, story, solution,
	  bug fix, or product offering is no different. The best solutions come from teams that
	  include representatives from multiple disciplines who can draw on their different
	  viewpoints and experiences to attack the problem. Ask a software engineer to design
	  a door, and he or she immediately begins thinking about how a door works—how
	  do the hinges work, how does the handle turn, and so on? Ask a product manager to
	  design a door, and he or she might begin thinking about the benefits the door should
	  achieve, how other competing doors function, and what the last round of user test-
	  ing revealed, Ask a system administrator to design a door, and he or she will prob-
	  ably start thinking about how to secure it or how to recover from common failures
	  within latches or locks. When these different viewpoints are collected together, they
	  make a stronger, more scalable, and more available product.
	  Network diversity is a measure of how individuals on a team have different per-
	  sonal or professional networks. This becomes important with regard to innovation
	  because almost all projects run into roadblocks. Teams with diverse networks are
	  better able to identify potential roadblocks or likely problems early in the project
	  because they can seek advice from a wide variety of people outside of the team.
	  When the team actually does encounter roadblocks, those teams with the most
	  diverse networks are better suited to finding resources outside of their teams to get
	  around the obstacle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcv4z50pbcf7ccrhz3tv1z5))
	- When faced with limited personnel and resources, teams often try to make do
	  with what the organization has at the time. This approach can result in considerable
	  risk for the company. Consider the situation where there are not enough product
	  owners. The outcome may be hastily written user stories and poor prioritization,
	  which can in turn result in costly mistakes made by the Agile teams. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcv5f2ejfgc0k85qy7x7m0g))
	- The first step for the Agile teams is to ensure they have the necessary resources
	  to perform their function well. Anytime a key resource is missing, the team is in
	  jeopardy. One way to make the business case for necessary resources is to use the
	  Kanban board to visually display bottlenecks in the development process. Another
	  approach is for the team to share resources across teams. The limited resource,
	  such as DevOps engineers, can be shared across teams. These individuals should be
	  assigned to multiple teams but not all teams. Think multitenant but not all-tenant.
	  For example, if you have two DevOps engineers and six Agile teams, assign DevOps
	  engineer 1 to Agile teams A, B, and C. Assign DevOps engineer 2 to Agile teams
	  D, E, and F. This way the teams feel some sense of connectedness with the DevOps
	  engineers assigned to them. They start to think, “DevOps engineer 1 is my go-to
	  person” rather than “We have a pool of two DevOps engineers to whom I make
	  requests by submitting a ticket to a queue.” See the difference? In once scenario
	  we’re breaking down walls; in the other we’re ensuring that they remain up between
	  the teams. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcv5k922qhgv1zzvsfj6ab9))
	- Agile teams should act autonomously, which means they should own the design
	  and architecture of their services and products.
	  • The ARB and JAD processes ensure a cross-functional design of services. The
	  Agile team, by its constitution or makeup, ensures this outcome as well.
	  • When resources such as DevOps engineers or architects are limited, assign
	  them to multiple teams as named individuals. Do not revert back to tickets and
	  queues fronting a pool of nameless DevOps resources.
	  247 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcv5vafvv1zv87yg1fgneky))
	- Sharing standards and knowledge across teams to achieve economies of scale
	  can still be accomplished with Agile teams. There are various approaches that
	  can be used in such cases. Choosing the right approach for your organization
	  depends on multiple factors, including your teams’ maturity, your products’
	  complexity, and your comfort with distributed command and control. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcv5y9n59gnncw0geteqpdg))
	- • Business is inherently risky; the changes that we make to improve scalability of
	  our systems can be risky as well.
	  • Managing the amount of risk in a system is key to availability and ensuring the
	  system can scale.
	  • Risk is cumulative, albeit with some degree of degradation occurring over time.
	  • For best results, you should use a method of risk assessment that is repeatable
	  and measureable.
	  • Risk assessments, like other processes, can be improved over time.
	  • There are both advantages and disadvantages to all of various risk assessment
	  approaches.
	  • There is a great deal of difference in the accuracy of various risk assessment
	  approaches.
	  • Risk management can be viewed as addressing both acute risk and overall risk.
	  • Acute risk management deals with single instances of change, such as a release
	  or a maintenance procedure.
	  • Overall risk management focuses on watching and administering the total level
	  of risk in the system at any point in time.
	  • For the risk management process to be effective, it must be used and followed.
	  • The best way to ensure a process is adhered to is to make sure it is a good fit
	  with the organization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvctz0cedtn5xggct6c0qv65))
	- • There is a classic balance among cost, quality, and speed in almost all business
	  decisions.
	  • Technology decisions, especially in the product development life cycle, must
	  balance these three constraints daily.
	  • Agile methods tend to have a bias toward speed for the purposes of developing
	  market insights (discovery). They do so by reducing scope/quality (quality is
	  defined as market fit here) to gain insights at an earlier stage in the product
	  development life cycle.
	  • Each project or feature can make different allocations across cost, quality, and
	  speed.
	  • Cost, quality, and speed are known as the project triangle because a triangle
	  represents the equal importance of all three constraints.
	  • There are short- and long-term ramifications of the decisions and tradeoffs
	  made during feature development.
	  • Tradeoffs made on individual features can affect the overall scalability of the
	  entire system.
	  • Technologists and managers must understand and be able to make the right
	  decisions in the classic tradeoff among speed, quality, and cost.
	  • There are at least three methods of performing a tradeoff analysis: gut feel,
	  pros-and-cons comparison, and decision matrix.
	  • The risk of the project should influence which method of tradeoff analysis is
	  performed.
	  • A set of rules to govern which analysis method should be used in which circum-
	  stances would be extremely useful for your organization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvcv7rrr6ajfj2yg6pwf3g6w))
