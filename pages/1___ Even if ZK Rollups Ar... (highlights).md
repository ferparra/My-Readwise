	- 1/ Even if ZK rollups are the holy grail for L2s on ethereum, ive yet to find a compelling reason for users to move from ORUs once they launch
	  
	  What do users love about ORUs? Low fees, high throughput, evm equivalence (explorer, wallets, dev tools, solidity etc..) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trading_vapor/status/1624002289844252678))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 2/ What do ZK rollups have to offer? Math purity, trustlessness, decentralisation
	  
	  Do users care about these features? Nope. Not directly at least
	  
	  What do ZK rollups compromise on to offer this? Evm equivalence and fees. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trading_vapor/status/1624002292276944909))
	- 3/ I know that ZK teams are working hard on the EVM equivalence item. But using a default wallet other than MM and needing a ZK optimised language to code complex smart contracts are important obstacles ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trading_vapor/status/1624002294743179264))
	- 4/ On the fee/throughput side, proto-danksharding will basically be the end game for ORUs and they won’t ever be threatened by ZK rollups on the fee side once deployed ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trading_vapor/status/1624002298195197953))
	- 5/ What’s left for ZK rollups to take L2 marketshare? 
	  
	  Of course there will be the classic ecosystem fund + retro-airdrop play to attract activity. But ORUs have been live for months, with major dapps already deployed, genuine activity and innovation (GMX, nftperp etc..) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trading_vapor/status/1624002300485181440))
	- 6/ That’s a lot of inertia and idk if those short term incentives will be enough for the activity to stick to ZK rollups if they cannot compete with ORUs with tx cost ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trading_vapor/status/1624002302875955200))
	- 7/ The one reason to gain L2 marketshare for ZK rollups imo is if the ZK tech allow usecases impossible on ORUs (privacy? True randomness? Other stuff my lil brain can’t fathom?)
	  
	  In other word, if your L2 is more expensive you better have a killer app that leverage your new tech ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trading_vapor/status/1624002305828724736))
	- 8/ In that regard, native account abstraction for Starknet might be a good start and i know that somehow contradict my third twit ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trading_vapor/status/1624002308790013953))
	- 9/ On a side note, those arguments won’t prevent ZK coins to absolutely print on the narrative shift so play accordingly
