	- [[Leadership]] is what you are here to learn—the qualities of character and mind that will make you fit to command a platoon, and beyond that, perhaps, a company, a battalion, or, if you leave the military, a corporation, a foundation, a department of government. [[Solitude]] is what you have the least of here, especially as plebes. You don’t even have privacy, the opportunity simply to be physically alone, never mind solitude, the ability to be alone with your thoughts
	- Why is it so often that the best people are stuck in the middle and the people who are running things—the leaders—are the mediocrities? Because excellence isn’t usually what gets you up the greasy pole. What gets you up is a talent for maneuvering.
	- We have a crisis of [[leadership]] in America because our overwhelming [[power]] and [[wealth]], earned under earlier generations of leaders, made us complacent, and for too long we have been training leaders who only know how to keep the routine going.
	- Marlow believes in the need to find yourself just as much as anyone does, and the way to do it, he says, is work, solitary work. Concentration. Climbing on that steamboat and spending a few uninterrupted hours hammering it into shape. Or building a house, or cooking a meal, or even writing a college paper, if you really put yourself into it.

	- “Your own reality—for yourself, not for others.” Thinking for yourself means finding yourself, finding your own reality.
	- Introspection means talking to yourself, and one of the best ways of talking to yourself is by talking to another person
	- The time to start preparing yourself for them is now. And the way to do it is by thinking through these issues for yourself—morality, mortality, honor—so you will have the strength to deal with them when they arise. Waiting until you have to confront them in practice would be like waiting for your first firefight to learn how to shoot your weapon.
