	- We are survival machines – robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes.
	- There are two types of randomness. The first type is predictable randomness such as when you roll a die. You don’t know for sure if a number will come up but you won’t be surprised if it does. The second type is unpredictable randomness such as the 9/11 attack. If we expected something like that to happen, we would have prevented it. Those events are known as black swans. Their existence invalidates what we consider normal, similar to how the existence of one single black swan invalidates the belief that all swans are white.
	- We can’t predict black swan events, but we make ourselves resistant to them by making ourselves antifragile. Antifragile is different from robust. Robust is not become weaker in the face of adversity. Antifragile is become stronger in the face of adversity. Curiosity and love are naturally antifragile. The more we try to stop them, the stronger they become.
	- by his Moral Foundations Theory. According to this theory, there are six foundations to morality:
	  
	  
	  Care/harm
	  Fairness/cheating
	  Liberty/oppression
	  Loyalty/betrayal
	  Authority/subversion
	  Sanctity/degradation
	- “One-sixth of the world’s population speaks Chinese. Why are we studying English?” he asked. He turned and gestured to a row of foreign teachers seated glumly behind him. “Because we pity them for not being able to speak Chinese!” The crowd roared.
	- “You know,” said Arthur, “it’s at times like this, when I’m trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I’d listened to what my mother told me when I was young.”
	  “Why, what did she tell you?”
	  “I don’t know, I didn’t listen.”
	- “All that is gold does not glitter,
	  Not all those who wander are lost”
	- On the Road by Jack Kerouac
	  … the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes “Awww!”
	- One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez
	  The secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude.
	- Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl
	  Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.
	- The White Tiger by Aravind Adiga
	  Iqbal, that great poet, was so right. The moment you recognize what is beautiful in this world, you stop being a slave. To hell with the Naxals and their guns shipped from China. If you taught every poor boy how to paint, that would be the end of the rich in India.
	- The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien
	  But in a story, which is a kind of dreaming, the dead sometimes smile and sit up and return to the world.

	- Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers by Mary Roach
	  The way I see it, being dead is not terribly far off from being on a cruise ship. Most of your time is spent lying on your back. The brain has shut down. The flesh begins to soften. Nothing much new happens, and nothing is expected of you.
	- Calypso by David Sedaris
	  …for we were middle-class and I’d been raised to believe that our social status inoculated us against severe misfortune. A person might be broke from time to time—who wasn’t?—but you could never be poor the way that actual poor people were: poor with lice and missing teeth … At what point had I realized that class couldn’t save you, that addiction or mental illness didn’t care whether you’d taken piano lessons or spent a summer in Europe?
