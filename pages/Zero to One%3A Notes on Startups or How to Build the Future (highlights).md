document_note:: This document provides an in-depth view on how to build successful startups and the importance of doing so. It highlights the importance of thinking from first principles, focusing on creating and capturing value, understanding that competition is not healthy, and building a team that is willing to work together towards a common goal. It also emphasizes the importance of focusing on the qualitative characteristics of a business and not just the numbers, as well as the need to plan for the long-term rather than just short-term growth. Lastly, it stresses the importance of getting the foundation right and finding the right people to work with.

	- When we think about the future, we hope for a future of progress. That progress can take one of two forms. Horizontal or extensive progress means copying things that work - going from 1 to n. Horizontal progress is easy to imagine because we already know what it looks like. Vertical or intensive progress means doing new things - going from 0 to 1. Vertical progress is harder to imagine because it requires doing something nobody else has ever done. The single word for vertical, 0 to 1 progress is *technology* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gskbkv0nh1nzt1dqk5tt4vht))
		- **Note**: This text discusses the two different forms of progress, horizontal and vertical. Horizontal progress is copying existing things that work, while vertical progress is doing something new and innovative, also known as technology. Vertical progress is harder to imagine and requires doing something that nobody else has ever done before.

	- 4 lessons learned from the dot-com crash which still guide business thinking today
	  
	  1.  Make incremental advances - grand visions inflated the bubble, so they should not be indulged. Anyone who claims to be able to do something great is suspect, and anyone who wants to change the world should be more humble. Small, incremental steps are the only safe path forward
	  2.  Stay lean and flexible - all companies must be "lean," which is code for "unplanned." You should not know what your business will do; planning is arrogant and inflexible. Instead you should try things out, "iterate," and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation
	  3.  Improve on the competition - don't try to create a new market prematurely. The only way to know you have a real business is to start with an already existing customer, so you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful competitors
	  4.  Focus on product, not sales - if your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it's not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution. Bubble-era advertising was obviously wasteful, so the only sustainable growth is viral growth
	  5.  These lessons have become dogma in the startup world and yet the opposite principles are probably more correct: it is better to risk boldness than triviality, a bad plan is better than no plan, competitive markets destroy profits, sales matters just as much as product. The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gskbn818hcq8ba0sshm4hahf))
		- **Note**: The dot-com crash of the early 2000s left behind four key lessons that still guide business thinking today: making incremental advances, staying lean and flexible, improving on the competition, and focusing on product rather than sales. These lessons have become the accepted dogma in the startup world, but the opposite principles may be more accurate. Boldness is preferable to triviality, a bad plan is better than no plan, competitive markets can create profits, and sales is just as important as product. The most contrarian action is to think for oneself.
	- Competition is not healthy but it is the ideology that pervades society and distorts thinking
	  
	  1.  Marx and Shakespeare provide two models for understanding almost every kind of conflict. People fight because they are different vs. fight but everyone is more or less alike. People lose sight of what really matters and become obsessed with their rivals. Rivalry causes us to overemphasize old opportunities and slavishly copy what worked in the past ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gskbrp7dpea9xj1y0ygad8jk))
	- Sales and distribution tend to be undervalued by entrepreneurs who believe good product sells itself. It is best when one's sales skill or the persuasion to buy is hidden as nobody likes being reminded they are being sold
	  
	  1.  Two metrics set the limits for effective distribution. The total net profit that you earn on average over the course of your relationship with a customer (Customer Lifetime Value) must exceed the amount you spend on average to acquire a new customer (Customer Acquisition Cost). In general, the higher the price of your product, the more you have to spend to make a sale - and the more it makes sense to spend it
	  2.  Poor sales rather than bad product is the most common cause of failure ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gskbqhx96pjrgrq7jj8he5b7))
		- **Note**: The main message of this text is that sales and distribution should not be overlooked when creating a successful business. It is important to calculate the Customer Lifetime Value and Customer Acquisition Cost in order to ensure that the product can be effectively distributed. Additionally, it is suggested that poor sales are more likely to lead to failure than a bad product.
