- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- 1/n I'm beyond thrilled to announce that @RaygunIcecream has asked me to lead one of the books for #RoamBookClub3 along with @beauhaan;
	  
	  Your team is currently hard at work designing what we believe will be an extraordinary 6 week learning experience for our beloved #roamcult --> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1354432469655719936))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 2/n There will be 2 groups working side by side - Beau will lead a discussion of Ahrens' "How to Take Smart Notes" and I'll lead, for returning members, "The Culture Code" by Dan Coyle. 
	  
	  My group will have a limited number of spots. Beau's group will not be size-limited. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1354432471002013702))
	- 3/n if you are unable to join the Coyle group (enrollment has to be capped, sorry) don't worry; you can still follow along; my plan is to live tweet + carry our discussion out to Twitter
	  
	  Furthermore, the plan is to bring you more "episodes".
	  
	  This is just the beginning! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1354432472390361093))
	- 4/n as a "teaser", I want to share what I've been working on - the 1st principles I plan to keep in mind as we develop the project further.
	  
	  Expect more updates soon! 
	  
	  Follow @RoamBookClub, @RaygunIcecream, and @beauhaan to stay part of this discussion, if you haven't already!

	- 8/n A quick behind-the-scenes moment as @beauhaan and I talk, on the Slack, about how the two groups that we are leading, can (and will) complement each other.
	  
	  I'll write more about this later, I am sure, 
	  
	  (it's too long to unpack right now...but you'll hear more about this!) https://t.co/siLidG0bCf ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1354494030768263169))
	- 9/n Alexandrian Design, in a nutshell:
	  
	  1. Iterate
	  2. When things work, strengthen them 
	  3. When they don't,  reflect on how to strengthen them
	  4. Always invite more life and vibrancy into the room
	  
	  This is at the heart of all my thinking about our next 6 weeks of @RoamBookClub ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1354808565236604931))
	- 10/n pure truth right here.
	  
	  As @DocAyomide says, 
	  
	  "Connection over collection"
	  
	  https://t.co/tSaFqAVgZS ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1355154587594887179))
	- 11/n Definitely feeling this energy, as we get everything ready for kickoff tomorrow.
	  
	  Guys,  I think #RoamBookClub3 is going to be 🔥🔥🔥
	  
	  I can FEEL it.
	  
	  @RaygunIcecream, @beauhaan, and a crew working behind the scenes. 
	  
	  https://t.co/U1zF72OlL9
	  
	  Teamwork makes the dream work! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1355505393485529088))
	- 12/n what's most exciting to me is that we (RBC team) are literally building a LIQUID NETWORK (shoutout to RBC 1, where we read one of @Conaw's favorite books "Where Good Ideas Come From")
	  
	  First we read about it
	  
	  Now we're putting it into practice
	  
	  Cc: @beauhaan @RaygunIcecream ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1355518072224800779))
	- 13/n in the behind-the scenes conversations with folks including @roamhacker , @brandontoner , @DharamKapila , @CharlesSimsFarr , @CatoMinor3 , @beauhaan , @RaygunIcecream and others ...
	  
	  We are unfolding a live process of bringing diverse perspectives and expertise into the room ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1355518946074533889))
	- 14/n the synergy of thoughts and talents, as we tackle the challenge of "how do we build the best book club experience possible" for #RoamBookClub3, is nothing short of inspiring
	  
	  Cc @RaygunIcecream @beauhaan ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1355519416834773000))
	- 15/ going to add this great tweet and thread from @rjnestor, because he articulates so well, one of the principles I want to infuse in RBC 3.0 :
	  
	  "Follow the OOMPH"
	  
	  That gut feeling you have as a writer, when you're onto something

	- 16/n I AM SO EXCITED GUYS - just wrote the first Zettelquestion into our graph!
	  
	  This is at the absolute heart of my vision for RBC 3.0
	  
	  I want to elevate Zettelquestions to 1st class status of @RoamResearch use
	  
	  Thrilled to be planning this wi @beauhaan and @RaygunIcecream ...

	- 17/n been working on the outline of #RoamBookClub3 most of the day today; troubleshooting little things with @beauhaan ;
	  
	  Thinking a lot, in these final stages of preparation, about
	  
	  "Perfection happens not when nothing more can be added, it's when nothing more can be taken away" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1355694170518634497))
	- 18/n there's a beautiful moment in preparing for any kind of group session whether it's a meeting or a lesson plan
	  
	  You plan and plan and write and write,  it gets bigger and more complicated, 
	  
	  Until suddenly it starts to get simpler and simpler 
	  
	  I love that moment! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1355860880060084227))
	- 19/n one of the fun things about working with @beauhaan is hearing him say "I AM GLAD YOU ASKED"
	  
	  this official Beau quote, which is also a tribute to his thougthfulness and dedication as a teacher, is now a part of the Roam Book Club 3 instructions page (for the Coyle Cohort): 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtEnRM2U0AQwsZs.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1355908379546329089))
	- 20/n And we're off! The adventure has started ...
	  
	  Despite some technical "bumps" which we are faithfully + dutifully committed to resolving, we've laid out our road map and we're ready to start working together!
	  
	  This first week, we will have writing prompts in the graph --> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356014555785125890))
	- 21/n ... each day, as we establish our relationships with some of the main themes of the book. We're going to reconvene next week and my group will be discussing chapters 1-4 of Dan Coyle's book. 
	  
	  I'm excited by people's energy and eager to see what we can create together! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356014557416673284))
	- 22/n Haha I just realized we have TWO "leading edges" of graph activity because of the international date line! (@beauhaan you're going to see this, too ...)
	  
	  We're GLOBAL, friends!
	  
	  Committing to writing TWO daily updates each day, for both sides of the international date line. https://t.co/3apraYPHbg ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356217929990250496))
	- 23/n by the way a huge THANK YOU to all for bearing with us through some technical + set up difficulties 
	  
	  It is the nature of ambitious projects to encounter unforeseen obstacles
	  
	  We're committed to making things work for everybody, and improving along the way. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356224111106637832))
	- 24/ I AM SO EXCITED GUYS PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO THE WRITING PROMPT IN THE GRAPH - WOO HOO !!!
	  
	  Check out that magic number "10", it means 10 people have already written in - and it is like 5.40AM here in California - but did I mention we have participants from around the globe? 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtJR6noUwAMnVnR.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356236673495957512))
	- 25/n but wait there's more! What a joy it is to read these thoughtful, carefully considered responses!
	  
	  DAMN I feel like Aladdin walking --> treasure cave
	  
	  To get this kind of collective willingness to consider, to engage, to write - EXACTLY what I was hoping for
	  
	  Thanks guys! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356237630850035714))
	- 26/ an (admittedly slightly niche) use-case for "∆" :
	  
	  Keep a message that "surfs" along, 1 day ahead of me, as a message for the folks on the other side of the international date line: (need to set the "increment", 2nd variable, to "+0" instead of "+2", for a constant interval)

	- 27/ PROGRESS OVER PERFECTION
	  
	  this wonderful quote comes from book club participant @markmcelroy 
	  
	  I love these words so much, I am seriously considering getting a tattoo (elegant,  cursive script)
	  
	  Whether or not that happens, might be unofficial motto #2 of my RBC cohort... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356287834869571584))
	- 28/ IT'S HAPPENING!
	  
	  https://t.co/JJnjOm4yFl ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356359947047456768))

	  https://t.co/olXICMpz5J ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356372459197370368))
	- 30/n Surfing the wave! I LOVE it
	  
	  Folks are engaging with the shared graph of #RoamBookClub3 in beautiful, authentic, and meaningful ways, + their writing "seeds" each day's discussion prompt! My subconscious mind is listening for themes, and finding resonance with participants. https://t.co/xjVUuLDnFT ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356648375962071040))
	- 31/n It works because people are taking RISKS -
	  
	  They are daring to be authentic in a semi-public setting.
	  
	  I think this is multiplayer @RoamResearch, at its potential BEST.
	  
	  It's not a thing apart form community, it's a catalyst for community if used "right". 
	  
	  Stay tuned!!! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356648378076073987))
	- 32/n THIS (see below) - a living, breathing "graph"- 
	  
	  Why? b/c of [[Christopher Alexander]] (cc: @francis_miller and @Conaw ... )
	  
	  We are aiming for nothing short of the "Quality Without A Name" ... aka QWAN.
	  
	  This is the ❤️️of what we are aiming for.

	- 33/n Thanks so much, Tali! 
	  
	  This means so much to me, to @beauhaan , to @RaygunIcecream  + the whole team of organizers at @RoamBookClub -
	  
	  We are all so grateful and excited, to see the early levels of engagement that we're seeing!!!  ❤️️#RoamBookClub3

	- 34/n   I just wrote a [[Zettel]] - ENTIRELY INSPIRED by the activity of our GROUP.
	  
	  "Being a part of a group is a *healing* process, b/c, in the process of aligning with the group's "Dreams, Needs + Ambitions" we are liberated from the potential prison of internal pre-occupation" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356738198857113600))
	- 35/ It's weird to say the "group" wrote this - but it's also entirely true. 
	  
	  I feel as if the clarity of this only emerged 4 me from reading what a number of ppl wrote into the graph.
	  
	  It's an astonishing feeling to allow the group to push you to clarify, to amend, personalize. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356738199935045635))
	- 36/ This AM, diving into writing up tips + tricks for using the word + char count features in @RoamResearch + I REALLY appreciate how writing this up solidifies my own understanding of how they work.
	  
	  To attempt to teach something is, first and foremost, to commit to learn it.

	- 37/ OK I have to show this to you guys because I think it's really exciting. 
	  
	  @iamvincenttam wrote a great obs'vn into our multiplayer roam, about how he learned from karaoke that being willing to "icebreak" - by being the 1st person to sing - helped *others* with their anxiety ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356966651766312961))
	- 38/ + then he connected it what makes WRITING feel more easeful, which is: it's easier to write when you KNOW that you'!re helping someone wi your writing.
	  
	  I, in turn, realized - this feels like a "Zettel" to me - so I made it one! ... building on what HE wrote. multiplayer FTW! 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtTptkoVEAAQrXS.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356966655851520003))
	- 39/ And the NEXT step was to create a QUESTION - an umbrella question if you will, or "Zettel Question" - in other words WHY was Vincent's observation important? What was the underlying vital question that made it feel significant?
	  
	  This is the part that I am excited about! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356966657965527040))
	- 40/ My feeling about that is, it "felt" important because it provided one clear answer to the bigger question of "What are the conditions under which creative flow in writing, anyway?" -  might be only ONE PART - but it sure feels important.
	  
	  So now we are on a bigger "quest"! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356966659240513536))
	- 41/ So in essence, we "pivoted" from a statement, to a question - thereby expanding our scope
	  
	  We've generated a new "focal point for thought", which, really, is what #Zettelquestions are intended to be.
	  
	  PROOF. OF. CONCEPT. 
	  
	  So excited! Thx @iamvincenttam for the inspiration! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1356966660826144768))
	- Man! 
	  
	  Just the sheer level of INSIGHT from our multiplayer graph!
	  
	  So many people are surfacing layers to our book  and questions, that I just did not see when I read it on my own!

	- 43/ I was so excited/happy I forgot to number that, then I saw it was # FORTY TWO
	  
	  "Roaman Lore":
	  
	  This is a special number to #roamcult for *at least* 3 reasons
	  
	  1. Douglas Adams
	  2. The school where co-founders @Conaw and @hashbrown490 met
	  3. The amazing work of @Roamhacker ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1357024281536811010))
	- 44/n If you don't know the story behind #2 - read this, because it's fascinating
	  
	  https://t.co/4tUzLE54Xw
	  
	  ... and furthermore, you might even sense some resonances with the "perform under stress" tests Coyle describes later in our book (in the part about Navy SEALS training.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1357024284284133378))
	- 45/ Julie Freyburg (@ahh_morning) said something, in response to one of our group-writing prompts, that really resonated with me:
	  
	  "Perfectionism is a particular kind of distortion, of the field of possibility" 
	  
	  Thanks, Julie! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1357178335147692041))
	- 46/n hey guys pls correct if I'm wrong
	  
	  but I believe that's an early simple #astrolabe in the Flammarion engraving, top left

	- 48/ an analogy for how I think @RoamBookClub might continue to grow:
	  
	  A cell, differentiating through mitosis in a pluripotent way, giving rise to specialized cells

	- 50/n really appreciate the detailed, thoughtful feedback I got from both @brandontoner and @ahh_morning this week in zoom calls talking about "meeting structure" ideas
	  
	  Great wisdom in our community
	  
	  Thanks, Julie and Brandon, for your insights! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1357402156354048000))

	- 52/n Might try this (see 53) in book club - thx for the idea Brandon! 
	  
	  What if it was in a place that was block referenced so that all user ID's could be seen together?
	  
	  What if it was an attribute and then you could have an {{attr}} table, maybe? Everyone's status in real time? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1357456274091216897))
	- 53/n idea from @brandontoner  (relevant discussion, see 52/n above)

	- 54/n Well, well, well
	  
	  It turns out you can pipe one entire Roam graph *inside* another using {{iframe: }} - embedded one works @ full speed once loaded (slight loading delay, startup only)
	  
	  Here's an iframe of our book club page WITHIN my personal graph. (CSS for border, size.). 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Etgr1trVEAICaBP.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1357883692685824001))
	- 55/n To clarify - the previous tweet just shows one graph, in the purple rectangle, displayed from within ANOTHER graph. 
	  
	  There's a slight delay when I land on the page as it loads, but once loaded, it appears to be fully functional.
	  
	  Interestingly, this allows you to --> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1357885215067099136))
	- 56/ --> use the sidebar, especially if you move it to the midpoint, to have functionally two graphs open, at the same time on your screen. 
	  
	  (Though of course,  their links remain separated - it's more like a "portal" than anything else) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1357885216036057090))
	- 57/n
	  
	  SESSION 2 in 8 hours + I'm already excited!
	  
	  Introducing a really big "Zettelquestion" today!
	  
	  I feel like an early hunter who located a woolly mammoth, + is bringing it to a dance party wi my tribe
	  
	  Also,  excited to see what we can do wi/ @beauhaan 's zettel architecture https://t.co/1Zg7A6njVx ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1358394683152424963))
	- 58/n Ryan, we could not agree more!
	  
	  100% yes.
	  
	  This is the underlying "deep project" of @RoamBookClub

	- 61/n love this idea from @billpetro 
	  
	  Future @RoamBookClub (s) could function as the seeds of "interest communities"/guilds

	- 62/n One of the reasons I'm really excited this week, is - I think we've got our conventions and processes now into pretty coherent form 
	  
	  Which means I can shift gears from planning,  layout,  structure
	  
	  To the purer joy of simply writing + exploring in our group @RoamResearch ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1358773255989989384))

	- 71/n one of my guiding thoughts for @RoamBookClub is what I'll just call "activating the personal layer"
	  
	  That is: there is an algorithmic layer to thought which is very powerful;
	  
	  But inspiration + creativity also occur in a deeper way, and guided by emotion;
	  
	  This, too matters. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1359142693771780099))
	- 72/n let me rephrase a little 
	  
	  There are places within us, that are more powerful than thought or language
	  
	  Those places sometimes move us to build, create + do
	  
	  Thought or language is not the prime mover of this process, but nonetheless can guide us to where the process begins. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1359145462746411014))

	  If you're moved by a book, there's a good chance you're ready -
	  
	  Zettels (a.k.a. "enduring thoughts") are often arrived at, through the gateway of an emotion.

	- 145/n just a quick memo here (I'm sure @beauhaan can corroborate)
	  
	  Working in the multliplayer graph has been an individual accelerator course in @RoamResearch technique.

	- 156/n This is just to observe that BEFORE @RoamBookClub , I thought that the 2nd reading of a book I already read, via book club, would mean, maybe, I'd then understand it 150% as well, i.e. "half again" as well -
	  
	  This is wrong.

	- 157/n ... once again, for the folks in the back:
	  
	  The act of reading a book again, but in the company of others, MAGNIFIES your understanding of that book by many factors.
	  
	  This is why @RoamBookClub is so powerful.

	- 160/n Why all the emphasis on "Zetteling"? 
	  
	  The answer is pretty simple - you HAVE to learn some form of Zetteling in order to solve the convergence <--> divergence problem in @RoamResearch. 
	  
	  "Zettels" are just "convergences".
