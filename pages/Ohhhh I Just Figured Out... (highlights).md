	- Ohhhh I just figured out a cool trick in [[@logseq]] for naming the Journals pages (Daily Notes Page).
	  
	  If you use the yyyy/MM/dd format, it sets up a set of hierarchies from the namespacing!! (Giving you month pages, and year pages) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/brandontoner/status/1490785393045909512))

	- So today would be 2022/02/07 
	  
	  Which would automatically create [[2022]] and [[2022/02]] as parent pages. 
	  
	  This is super useful as a place to reference blocks relevant to a given month, or year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/brandontoner/status/1490786109244297227))
	- Here’s how it looks.

	- I’ve been sorta doing this manually in Roam on a [[Date Planner]] page I would populate by template.
	  
	  This is much better since it’s automatic.

	- Ideally, this would work for ANY naming structure, just based on the fact that these are dates and the dates pages should behave like dates.
	  
	  AND there should be options for additional levels of granularity (i.e. Quarters, Weeks) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/brandontoner/status/1490787021442457601))
	- I’m sure this trick is known to folks in the @logseq community already — but damn, I’m pleased to discover it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/brandontoner/status/1490787585488261130))
