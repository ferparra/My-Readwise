	- 1/ One of the MOST important concepts anyone can understand—
	  
	  ENTROPY.
	  
	  The concept applies not just to physics + life, but startups, relationships, geopolitics.
	  
	  My eldest child, 10yo daugther, asked excellent Q last night that may seem foolish...

	- 2/ Why do we go from WET to DRY 
	  (say getting out of shower/bath) 
	  but never from DRY to WET?
	  
	  We talked about:
	  -solid ice > blob of liquid > dissipated vapor
	  -how eggs break but don’t go back 
	  -how glasses break but don’t reform
	  
	  How systems trend to disorder without more energy
	- 3/ 
	  I am re-reading the incredible 
	  
	  “ORDER out of CHAOS”—Ilya Prigogine  
	  
	  who articulated beautifully how we get 
	  structured macro state (~whirlpool)
	  EMERGING from non-equilibrium state (~water down a drain)
	  
	  Here’s a copy (and a few of my highlights)...

	- 5/“For 4yrs now Trump brought improbable people together.
	  
	  Those who treasure the armed alliance were as 1 with peace-sign daubers against Trump. So too cosmopolitan rich + socialists who would tax them; strict liberals + critics of liberalism as a cover for unconscious racism”
	- 6/ “Even before his formal departure, his adhesive effect on the US left is weakening. Moderate Democrats blame the party’s mixed Congressional results on its off-putting radicals....Each one has the potential to turn Democrat against Democrat.”
	  
	  ENTROPY.
	- 7/ Commenter: “Things Fall Apart”
	  YES it’s as if brilliant @questlove took album title “Things Falls Apart” (aka Entropy) 
	  
	  and then took the drum tempo from structured hiphop beat to syncopated percussive chaos 
	  
	  at end of @theroots x @fatbellybella Erykah Badu “You Got Me”🤯 https://t.co/LnOKUITvDj
