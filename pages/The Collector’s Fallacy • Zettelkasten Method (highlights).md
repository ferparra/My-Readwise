	- As knowledge workers, we’re inclined to look for the next groundbreaking thought, for intellectual stimulation:  we pile up promising books and articles, and we store half the internet as bookmarks, just so we get the feeling of being on the cutting edge.

	- Until we merge the contents, the information, ideas, and thoughts of other people into our own knowledge, we haven’t really learned a thing.
	- If we read without taking notes, our knowledge increases for a short time only.  Once we forget what we knew, having read the text becomes worthless.

	- Shorter cycles of research, reading, and knowledge assimilation are better than long ones.
	- To get started,  do research for one hour and no second more.  Process the collected material until the stack is empty.
	  Then do a quick review of the cycle:  how well did it go?  Did you learn something new?  Was it too much or too little you found in the amount of time?
	  Afterwards, change the time limit a bit if you think it wasn’t appropriate.
