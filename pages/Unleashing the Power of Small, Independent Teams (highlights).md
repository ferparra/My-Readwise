	- Define outcomes, then let teams chart their own path toward them
	  
	  Corporate leaders at agile companies put teams in charge of product features or components of their customer’s journey and give them the freedom to decide the specific improvements that should be made. An effective manager in this context will determine what the business outcomes should be, based on the company’s overall priorities, and will spell it out for the team using real-world measures of business performance such as conversion rates or audience engagement.

	- Outside the IT function, managers who understand agile ways of working can be hard to find at traditional companies. To fit in with highly independent teams, most managers will need some help to learn how to organize their thinking around products rather than processes; to direct teams with performance goals instead of work plans; and to position themselves as stewards, not superiors. Executives can, and should, make sure that their managers have opportunities to develop these behaviors and habits of mind. They can see that managers are taught to use new tools, from collaboration software to analytics engines. They can encourage managers to rotate through assignments with various independent teams, which promotes constant learning. They should pair them with fellow managers who have more experience working with independent teams and let them see how these peers behave. And they can change the way they evaluate managers’ performance, placing more emphasis on measurable outcomes and gauging their impact through 360-degree reviews.
