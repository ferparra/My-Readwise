	- The way you think about the exponential function is (probably) wrong.
	  
	  Don't think so? I'll convince you. Did you realize that multiplying ùëí by itself œÄ times doesn't make sense?
	  
	  Here is what's really behind the most important function of all time:

	  If the sidewalk is wet, is it raining? Not necessarily. Yet, we are inclined to think so. This is a preposterously common logical fallacy called "affirming the consequent".

	- This is not a trick: the cosine of the imaginary number ùëñ is (e‚Åª¬π + e)/2.
	  
	  How on Earth does this follow from the definition of the cosine? No matter how hard you try, you cannot construct a right triangle with an angle ùëñ. What kind of sorcery is this?
	  
	  Read on to find out.
