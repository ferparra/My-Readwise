	- •   It expresses **value**. We can see why it matters to customers.
	  •   It represents **vision and strategy**. Our company’s product and business strategy are reflected in it.
	  •   It’s a **leading indicator** of success. It predicts future results, rather than reflecting past results.
	  •   It’s **actionable**. We can take action to influence it.
	  •   It’s **understandable**. It’s framed in plain language that non-technical partners can understand.
	  •   It’s **measurable**. We can instrument our products to track it.
	  •   It’s **not a vanity metric**. When it changes we can be confident that the change is meaningful and valuable, rather than being something that doesn’t actually predict long-term success—even if it makes the team feel good about itself.

	- Some metrics tell us what has already happened to our business; these are **lagging** indicators. Other metrics predict what will happen to our business; these are **leading** indicators. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbwezeaj26j9xxy0v40nbj0))
	- Your North Star should be something you believe you can **influence** or do something about. This means it shouldn’t be a measure of a broader market trend or reflect real-world realities that would be true whether your product existed or not.

	- The North Star shouldn’t be so arcane or abstract that you can’t easily explain it to non-technical people or express it in plain language. A simple test: As you develop your North Star, describe it to someone who knows your business but lacks deep technical knowledge. If it’s a good metric, they’ll be able to quickly understand it without much trouble. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbwhhqpz8svsw8844hefvw6))
	- Some metrics might make you feel good about your team’s performance or your market in the short term, but don’t actually tell you about your product’s long-term success. Be wary of choosing these vanity metrics for your North Star Metric. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbwhvcnph88cj7fk0aj3cnh))
	- **The North Star Framework is not:**
	  
	  •   Your roadmap
	  •   Your software development process
	  •   A prioritization framework
	  •   A goal-setting framework, like OKRs or Focus Cards, though the North Star can be a strong foundation upon which to base goals
	  •   Management by Objectives (MBOs)
	  •   Perfection (no framework is!). Many successful product teams have used other methods with much success. We think that’s great, and we encourage those teams to keep doing what they’re doing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbwkk884vy41zp5mrxhhya3))
