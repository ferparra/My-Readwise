document_note:: Dan Harris’s book, 10% Happier, offers practical advice on how to incorporate meditation into one’s life in a non-guru-like way. It teaches how to recognize, allow, investigate and non-identify with one's feelings, to detach from them and be mindful of what one is feeling. Harris delves into his own experiences of depression and addiction, and his journey to understanding Buddhism and meditation. He interviewed Deepak Chopra and other experts, and shares the scientific evidence of the benefits of meditation. Through meditation, one learns to become present, to focus on one thing at a time and to be non-attached to the outcome. He also encourages being nice to others, as it will make one happier. Ultimately, meditation can help one manage their ego and become more tolerant of others.
