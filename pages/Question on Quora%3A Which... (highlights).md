	- Question on Quora: Which commonly-discussed growth metrics in consumer tech businesses are the most meaningless and/or misleading? Here's my thread üëá ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632839473618944))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1. Cumulative charts for anything. These can only go up and to the right ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632840220209153))
	- 2. Registered users. Totally useless, although sometimes I like to ask about this as a ratio to active users to get a sense for how efficiently the user acquisition is happening ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632840895467521))
	- 3. Any retention metrics that aren‚Äôt standardized into cohort curves. Sometimes people will give a single snapshot number, like a ‚Äú3 months later, X% still use the app!‚Äù and that‚Äôs not that helpful ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632841969225729))
	- 4. Install numbers, without signups or activated signups or something more meaningful ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632843311403008))
	- 5. For marketplace companies, ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù that‚Äôs actually ‚Äúgross bookings‚Äù or GMV. Or GMV that counts in weird things, like security deposits or one-time setup charges ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632844255117312))
	- 6. ARR meaning, ‚Äúannual revenue run rate‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äúannual recurring revenue.‚Äù Please, let‚Äôs just stick to ARR for recurring, not run rate. Thanks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632845295308800))
	- 7. Taking the peak revenue of any single day and annualizing it as the headline number ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632846297759744))
	- 8. Unlabeled X and Y axes in charts ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632846989783040))
	- 9. Cohort curves that are some complex subset of users that make the retention look better ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632847711203328))
	- 10. Showing ‚ÄúCAC‚Äù that‚Äôs actually blended CAC, and when you just look at the Paid CAC, it‚Äôs way below LTV ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632848441106432))
	- 11. LTV. Because who really cares about the lifetime of a user ‚Äî startups should just manage to margin earned by a customer you acquire over the first 6‚Äì12 months, not the lifetime. That‚Äôs how you will make your ad spend decisions ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632849221246976))
	- 12. Any misleading ratios where the denominator and numerator are totally non-obvious. Stick to actives, please. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632850273951745))
	- 13. Active user definitions that are complicated (must have visited 3 sessions in the last week, and done one action out of a list of 5). It makes all the downstream calcs on retention, engagement, etc misleading since you‚Äôre throwing away all the data for the less active users ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632850995343360))
	- 14. If you have a desktop app, and web, and mobile, break down the metrics for all three. Don‚Äôt combine, please ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632851762921472))
	- There are many, many more‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs a quick start. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1105632852501159936))
