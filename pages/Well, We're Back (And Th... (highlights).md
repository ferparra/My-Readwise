	- Well, we're back (and then some, as of writing). What happened?
	  
	  A thread about where we've been, where we are, and what's different about them.

	- As usual, not investment advice. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1450955918389260288))
	- The last time BTC was this high, a few factors were (apparently) motivating it:
	- Despite a persistent narrative that the inflows were "organic this time, we swear!" and spot-driven, the data always told a different story.

	- And so when the COIN listing didn't go as well as everyone was expecting, a small reversion turned into a HUGE one when a ton of the new levered longs got liquidated -- my old mantra! 
	  
	  Much of the rally got wiped out.

	- Flirting back down around $30k, it became unclear whether the (futures-driven, the first time) rally would ever happen again -- but given crypto's propensity for over-reacting to news, it seemed pretty reasonable to expect some of the news-driven downturn to undo itself, too. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1450955924085121029))
	- And undo itself it did! Granted, plenty of new good news has happened, too:
	- A Bitcoin ETF has been discussed FOREVER, and rumors have been swirling, of late, about one (or more) finally getting U.S. approval. I think these rumors (-turned-confirmed-news) + people deciding they over-reacted to the 40th version of China banning BTC fueled most of this:

	- And the ETF has been going great! By all rights it's out-performing most anyone's expectations, and it's continued to fuel inflows (CME futures premia have been HIGH, and that's what makes up the BTC exposure from BITO).

	- And so, today, BTC achieved a new ATH (if you didn't hear) -- and that makes a lot of sense! The rumors pointed this direction, and, for once, the event kinda went as well as the rumors said -- so of course it kept out-performing expectations.

	- (Note that it happened right around Eastern open -- this is a reasonable expectation, that there'd be momentum around that time, since it was quite likely a priori that the market was all watching BITO activity and planning to make the same basic directional bets around it.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1450955940560351239))
	- So that's where we are. The natural question, of course: where are we going?
	  
	  There's a real extent to which I think it's hard to say because this feels sorta unprecedented. https://t.co/GrlEr2ssnK ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1450955951641616385))
	- We *could* return to something like this pretty quickly: 
	  
	  https://t.co/qYQpkxB6bA
	  
	  I'd definitely believe that at least a muted version of that could happen if there's bad news soon.
	  
	  But I'd also believe we won't! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1450955953424289800))
	- Check this graph out -- it's showing BTC futures open interest on the major platforms. Compared to April (when BTC was at the same price!), OIs are ca. 20% lower -- that means the potential for a huge liquidation-driven draw-down is WAY lower.

	- And, in fact, a lot less of the inflows were driven by the types of perps super prone to liquidations. So, while I have no idea whether the market will go up or down from here, I think there is less (but still not zero) chance that a downside move is really outsized. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1450955957878632452))
	- And the same is true for an upside move, roughly. Near a local max, there's always some chance for really old shorts to get wiped out since we're at prices they've never had to fend off -- but SO many of those have been liquidated on the way up already. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1450955959258554369))
	- So ... I really do feel like I don't know which direction things will go (I could believe more good news, I could believe some bad news, I could believe the market decides this was too much of a rally, etc.). But I do think liquidations are FINALLY starting to be less important. https://t.co/XDuhlGvX6N ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1450955965726081037))
	- Not *un*important, mind you -- but less. And that's exactly what you expect of a more mature market where exchanges have been cracking down on super high leverage and more volume is driven by conservative institutions.

	- Learning how to trade these markets as they've evolved has been a lot of fun (being long during it has been pretty good too :P), and I'm excited to keep at it. The world is, increasingly, watching and trading with all of us, and it's a thrill to be a part of. https://t.co/EFWlGyQKe3 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1450955973561040901))
