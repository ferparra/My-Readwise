	- altruism is defined as the doing a selfless action to benefit another that potentially has a cost to the individual associated with it and which the giver receives no benefit. Pure or true altruism has been addressed by Dan Batson via his empathy-altruism hypothesis and he would postulate there is no true or pure altruism because the giver receives the warm glow of his action.
	- Empathy is simply the taking on of the emotional state of another and is not related specifically to suffering although often used in this context. Altruism is a selfless act toward another who typically is suffering, in need or in danger and which puts the giver at potential risk.
	- transcendence in my mind is an outward journey of connection which one recognizes that each of us is connected to the other and that our family is not our mother, father, sister or brother but is the entire human family and that our home is not where we live but the earth. When one recognizes this fact then they are truly transcendent.
