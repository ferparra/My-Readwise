	- I’ll note that working in a growing startup will give you many, many ideas for companies to start. Basically every internal tool at a company capable of putting good engineers on a “boring” problem should be used across the economy at companies that can’t get that caliber of engineer on that sort of problem.

	- The returns to pushing your cadence to faster are everywhere and they compound continuously, for years. Don’t send the email tomorrow. Don’t default to scheduling the meeting for next week. Don’t delay a worthy sprint until after the next quarterly planning exercise. Design control and decisionmaking structures to bias heavily in favor of preserving operating cadence.

	- I don’t think Stripe is uniformly fast. I think teams at Stripe are just faster than most companies, blocked a bit less by peer teams, constrained a tiny bit less by internal tools, etc etc. There are particular projects which have been agonizingly long to ship; literally years after I would have hoped them done. But across the portfolio, with now hundreds of teams working, we just get more done than we “should” be able to.
	- IC is short for “individual contributor”, which is corporate America speak for “directly does the work rather than managing the people who do the work.” At the same time, senior ICs are also supposed to exercise a form of [[leadership]]. Capacity to do that and also “get my hands dirty” in the same day is part of the job
