document_note:: The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement is a book in which Alex Rogo learns how to increase profits in companies by reducing inventory, eliminating bottlenecks, and applying the theory of constraints. The main message is that progress and better understanding requires challenging basic assumptions about the world and pursuing knowledge to make the world a better place. Alex also learns that whatever is the slowest process or bottleneck is the limiting factor, and must be improved in order to increase productivity. Furthermore, financial metrics can be hurtful if taken out of context, and the focus should be on improving flow and preventing overproduction. Finally, Alex learns to create a database of disruptions to address availability.

	- The goal is making money but this can be expressed in many different ways (cash flow, ROI, net profit) and some measurements to help you track this include *throughput, inventory and operational expense*.
	  
	  1.  Throughput is the rate by which money is generated through sales (finished product which isn’t sold is not throughput)
	  2.  Inventory is all the money the company has bought which it intends to sell
	  3.  Operational expense is all the money spent turning inventory into throughput.
	  4.  You must express the goal in terms of these measurements. Increasing throughput while simultaneously decreasing inventory and operational expense ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjxbf6zqmn99mhnmd81pq5))
	- Dependent events and statistical fluctuations are incredibly important to understand and keep track of. Whatever is the slowest process or bottleneck of any sort is your limiting factor. You can sprint in every other area but if you don’t increase the throughput of the bottleneck, productivity won’t increase at all. The capacity of the plant is the capacity of the bottleneck. The actual cost of a bottleneck is the total operating cost / the number of hours the bottleneck produces. Make sure the bottleneck’s time is never wasted (idle, working on defective parts, working on parts you don’t need immediately) and, if you can, shift work from bottleneck to non-bottlenecks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjxhkv90gb8rdym0cgxx8p))
		- **Note**: When you are trying to be productive, it is important to pay attention to the things that take the longest time to do. These are called bottlenecks. The plant's productivity will not increase unless the bottleneck is increased. The cost of having a bottleneck is the amount of money spent to keep it running divided by the time it takes to do it. That means it's important to never waste the time of a bottleneck by stopping it from working on things that are not necessary. If possible, try to move the work from the bottleneck to other places that can do it faster.
	- The amount of time material spends in a plant can be broken down into 4 parts
	  
	  1.  Set up while the resource is being set up
	  2.  Process time
	  3.  Queue time for resources
	  4.  Wait time for another part.
	  5.  By reducing batch sizes you can decrease the amount of time parts spend in queue and wait time since you are no longer turning non-bottlenecks into bottlenecks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjy8zdrq72nbfdcdwe2z19))
	- You have to shift from a cost-centered world to a throughput-centered one. You have to find the weakest link or the bottleneck first in order to increase throughput - not solely focused on cutting costs.
	  
	  1.  Identify the bottlenecks
	  2.  Identify how to exploit the bottlenecks
	  3.  Subordinate everything to the above decision
	  4.  Increase the bottleneck
	  5.  If the bottleneck is still broken go back to step one, and don't let company inertia stop you ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjyhqksmvxtjz1bh8rh05t))
	- Three fundamental questions
	  
	  1.  What to change
	  2.  What to change to
	  3.  How to go about making this change ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjynvwrqtg3n7sbzfrgac9))
	- Better production flow or shorter lead times creates incredible cost savings and efficiency savings for many reasons ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjyveq9e6kjk7ay4p3rnrf))
		- **Note**: This text discusses the advantages of improving production flow and reducing lead times, which can result in significant cost savings and increased efficiency.
	- Production's biggest focus has to be improving flow. There are many other things that can be done but that ultimately lies with other departments. They must prevent overproduction (don’t produce unneeded product), condemn local efficiencies and focus on the global. Lastly, you must balance the flow after all these disruptions are mitigated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmjzp3km17hs91nqpv280re))
