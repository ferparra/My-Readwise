document_note:: In Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, Robert Cialdini discusses 6 weapons of influence (Reciprocation, Commitment and Consistency, Liking, Authority, Social Proof, and Scarcity) which can be used to get people to say 'yes' without thinking. These influences can be used for good or malicious purposes and attack our automatic responses. Cialdini also explains how people are more likely to comply if surprised, how we desire consistency with previous commitments, how social proof and liking play a role in decision making, how authority can be misused, and how scarcity can lead to higher appreciation.

	- Mother turkey and nature – proven that mother turkeys respond to the “click” sound of their chicks even if comes from an animal who is usually a predator. 6 Cialdini refers to this blind, mechanical pattern of action as *click, whirr* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscwg2exdb1fef37ax293r8t))
		- **Note**: Mother turkeys have been studied and it has been proven that they will respond to the sound their chicks make, even if it comes from an animal that is usually a predator. This shows that mother turkeys will react automatically, without thinking, to their chicks' sounds.
	- Automatic behavior patterns make us very vulnerable as they can be taken advantage of, often without our noticing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscwgx1t4q3jq1r124zpvctf))
	- Contrast Effect – same thing can seem different depending on what preceded it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscwh4darmvzd8atfjxj4170))
		- **Note**: The Contrast Effect means that the same thing can look different depending on what came before it.
	- •   **Rule of reciprocity – people will repay any favor ever done to them. Universal and even the smallest favor elicits a repayment attitude**
	  •   Don’t accept anything for free, or at least realize you will feel like you owe them something
	  •   Can use to get asymmetric favors done for you as it is uncomfortable for people to feel like they are in “debt”
	  •   Mutual concession automatic too – move from big to small favor and usually other person will acquiesce
	  •   Rejection then retreat technique – start asking for something big and then tone down. It can still be big request, just smaller than first
	  •   Return favors with favors, tricks deserve no favors
	  •   People who are surprised are more likely to comply
	  •   **People like you less if you don’t allow them to reciprocate** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscwhknwa4rb5gzajm2wn5qq))
		- **Tags**: #[[reciprocity]]
		- **Note**: The rule of reciprocity states that people will repay any favor that is done for them, even if it is small. This can be used to get asymmetric favors done, by using the rejection-then-retreat technique of starting with a large request and then toning it down. It is important to return favors with favors, however, as tricks deserve no favors. People who are surprised by a request are more likely to comply, but people also do not like those who do not allow them to reciprocate.
	- Commitment and Consistency
	  
	  •   **People have a deep desire to remain consistent to their previous commitments. It is a central motivator of behavior**
	  •   Start small and build in order to get the most out of people
	  •   **Be careful about agreeing to trivial requests** as this can lead you down a dark road
	  •   A man judges himself and others by his deeds, more so than words
	  •   **Any goal you have, make sure to write it down and even share it – the more public the better** (pair with [Stickk](http://www.stickk.com/))
	  •   The more effort a commitment takes, the more it influences the attitude of that person
	  •   Active, public, effortful behavior causes the highest commitment
	  •   For long-term behavior change, can’t bribe, must convince
	  •   Lowball technique – start with a low initial price but renege at the very end
	  •   Listen to stomach to know when you are in an uncomfortable situation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscwjpk28t4df9ehz5ftsxk1))
		- **Note**: This chapter from Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert Cialdini discusses the concept of commitment and consistency. It explains that people have a strong desire to remain consistent to their previous commitments, and therefore, to be successful in persuasion, it is best to start small and build up. Additionally, it is important to be careful when agreeing to trivial requests, as this can lead to negative consequences. The text also suggests that writing down and sharing goals publicly is a helpful way to increase commitment and long-term behavior change. Additionally, techniques such as the lowball technique can be used to start with a low initial price and renege at the end. Finally, it is suggested to listen to one's gut in order to know when they are in an uncomfortable situation.
	- Social Proof
	  
	  •   **People tend to determine what is correct by seeing what others think is correct. The more people you see react in a certain way, the more powerful**
	    •   Canned laughter used because it increases the audience’s humorous appreciation
	  •   What we prefer to be true will seem true
	  •   When uncertain, we rely more on what others do
	  •   Suicide social proof – there are typically more suicides after a very public suicide
	  •   Impossible to single-handedly lead – need accomplice of a lower rank
	  •   **Must recognize when automatic thought processes are being taken advantage of**
	  •   Believe if crowd is acting a certain way, it has better info than we do but that is rarely the case ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscwm0mcn399sax065bvb2tc))
		- **Note**: In "Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion" by Robert Cialdini, the concept of "Social Proof" is discussed, which states that people tend to determine what is correct by seeing what others think is correct. It is also noted that canned laughter is used to increase the audience's humorous appreciation, and that when people are uncertain, they rely more on what others do. It is also pointed out that there must be recognition when automatic thought processes are being taken advantage of, and that believing that a crowd has better information than an individual is rarely the case.

	- Liking
	  
	  •   **People prefer to say yes to requests as it leads to others liking them**
	    •   Tupperware parties are a prime compliance setting
	  •   Liking can’t be stressed enough.
	  •   Factors which effect liking:
	    •   Being good looking ([halo effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect))
	    •   Similarity (dress, background, education, etc.)
	    •   Compliments – one of most successful car salesman ever sent hundreds of thousands of cards simply saying “I like you.”
	    •   Contact and cooperation
	    •   Conditioning and association (dislike those with bad news)
	  •   More likely to like those who feed us
	  •   **Big mistakes often occur when we are fond of person making the requests**
	  •   Flattery, even if false, works very often
	  •   Deliver good news as often as possible and be wary the company you keep
	  •   Sports fans so passionate about their teams because their identity is linked to the team, their “self” is at stake
	  •   When one’s pride is low, want to associate more with success – these people insecure as their worth comes extrinsically
	  •   If like someone too much, be wary as they may be using some of these tactics against you
	    •   Separate the person from what they are selling ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse6yaknzada2k9vc0xq3xag))
		- **Note**: The principle of liking states that people are more likely to comply with requests if they like the person making them. Factors such as physical attractiveness, similarity, compliments and contact can increase likability. Flattery, even when false, is often successful in increasing compliance. Good news should also be delivered often to increase likability. Sports fandom can be linked to one's identity, and people may seek out successful people to increase their own worth when their pride is low. It is important to be aware of the tactics used to increase likability, as they may be used against the individual.
	- Authority
	  
	  •   **Obedience to authority rarely takes conscious deliberation**
	  •   Milgram [shock experiment](https://www.google.com/search?q=milgram+shock+experiment&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS556US556&oq=milgram+shock&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.1934j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8) – people can do terrible things because they are simply obeying authority and not thinking
	  •   **Often react only to part of a situation, not seeing the whole picture**
	  •   Size and status are closely linked
	  •   To protect yourself, remove the element of surprise as much as possible
	  •   Factors of authority
	    •   Appearance of authority often enough (titles, clothes…). Symbol is often more powerful than substance
	    •   Larger signature linked with more important status
	  •   Ask yourself is the authority is truly an expert before obeying and how likely it is that they’re being untruthful for their advantage. Think of commercials with actors who are not experts in whatever it is they are trying to sell
	  •   Use this in your favor by showing that you have other people’s best intentions in mind. Honest and knowledgeable people have more credibility and that leads to people trusting you ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse6z8xennv093jyg1br77rc))
		- **Tags**: #[[authority]]
		- **Note**: In the book "Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion" by Robert Cialdini, the concept of authority is discussed, with examples such as the Milgram shock experiment demonstrating how people can do terrible things due to obedience to authority without taking conscious deliberation. It is also noted that people often react only to part of a situation without seeing the whole picture and that size and status are closely linked. To protect yourself, it is important to remove the element of surprise as much as possible. Authority can be shown through appearance of authority such as titles, clothes, and larger signatures. It is important to consider if the authority is truly an expert before obeying, and to use this concept in your favor by showing that you have other people's best interests in mind.
	- Scarcity
	  
	  1.  **Potential loss plays a huge role in our decisions**
	  2.  Rarity leads to people valuing whatever it is higher than they otherwise would
	  3.  Deadline tactic – get people to act quickly by creating an artificial deadline
	  4.  **People hate to lose freedoms they already have**
	    •   **Freedoms, once guaranteed, won’t be given up without a fight**
	    •   **Revolutions more common after good times followed quickly by bad times**
	  5.  People assign (overly) positive qualities to justify their desires
	  6.  When information is censored, we not only want it more but believe it more before we even get it
	    •   Value banned information and more favorable to it
	  7.  **Going from abundance to scarcity leads to higher appreciation than constant scarcity**
	  8.  Scarce things due to social demand are more highly valued
	  9.  Beware situations with scarcity and rivalry
	  10.  In these emotional situations, reason goes out the door
	  11.  **Joy lies not in experiencing the scarce commodity, but possessing it**
	  12.  Be aware of arousal from scarcity and stop to think – do I really want to use it or want to have it?
	  
	  1.  Understand these deeply embedded parts of human nature and you will be better protected to people hijacking your psychology. Understand how you take shortcuts and when there is an attack on them, we must retaliate in order to save our world and keep our shortcuts reliable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gse70bcqd1mfxb5evyzecchq))
		- **Tags**: #[[scarcity]]
		- **Note**: Robert Cialdini's book "Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion" explores how potential loss plays a huge role in our decisions and how rarity leads to people valuing things more than they otherwise would. Tactics such as creating artificial deadlines and censorship can also be used to manipulate people, who tend to assign overly positive qualities to justify their desires. Cialdini also highlights how going from abundance to scarcity leads to higher appreciation and how social demand can also cause things to become scarce and highly valued. Finally, Cialdini warns to be aware of the arousal from scarcity and to think carefully before making decisions in emotionally charged situations. Joy lies not in experiencing the commodity but in possessing it. He suggests understanding these deeply embedded parts of human nature to protect oneself from being psychologically hijacked.
