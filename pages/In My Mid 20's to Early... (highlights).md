	- In my mid 20's to early 30's I dealt with chronic low back pain.
	  
	  I went to a Chiropractor & he told me I'd have to live with the pain & get adjustments for the rest of my life.
	  
	  I said screw that, searched for a different solution & fixed my back.
	  
	  Here's how I did it:

		- **Note**: Thread
	- I started by assessing the problem & finding the root of the issue.
	  
	  My pain had nothing to do with my spine but from having a weak core, inactive glutes, lack of movement & ego lifting.
	  
	  Pain is multifactorial. To fix it you need to find the issues & fix it at the root. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1634555367509114880))
	- To strengthen my core I incorporated a series of exercises called The McGill Big 3 that consisted of:
	  
	  1. The McGill Crunch
	  2. Bird Dogs
	  3. Side Planks
	  
	  I did this every day and before I worked out. https://t.co/fsKRNJVnrX ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1634555369702715392))
	- To strengthen my glutes I activated them using glute bridges & made them stronger with hip thrusts.
	  
	  I did 12-15 reps of glute bridges as a warm up & every week I did 3-4 sets of heavy hip thrusts as part of my workouts. https://t.co/5RgLjPYRNQ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1634555372194152451))
	- I committed to more walking & less sitting.
	  
	  Long periods of inactivity causes the body to stiffen.
	  
	  So I aimed to get 8-10k steps a day.
	  
	  I invested in an adjustable desk to alternate between sitting & standing.
	  
	  Getting more movement throughout the day saved my low back.

	- Lastly, I had to get real with the way I was lifting weights.
	  
	  I found myself chasing big weights instead of focusing on lifting with good form.
	  
	  I went back to the gym, reduced all my weights down & focused on lifting the right way while stopping 1-2 reps away from failure. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1634555387717230592))
	- One thing I must mention is that this will not help everybody.
	  
	  This was specific to my root causes, which may or may not be yours.
	  
	  If my situation is similar to yours, then try out these solutions for 1-3 weeks and see if they work for you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1634555391345303555))
	- My solution to solving my back pain:
	  
	  1. Cat cows
	  2. The McGill Big 3
	  3. Strengthening my glutes
	  4. Getting 8-10k steps a day
	  5. An adjustable standing desk
	  6. Fixing my form & not lifting with my ego. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1634555393450942465))
