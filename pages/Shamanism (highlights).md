	- **Shamanism** is a religious practice that involves a practitioner (**shaman**) interacting with the [spirit world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_world_(Spiritualism)) through [altered states of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_state_of_consciousness), such as [trance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trance).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism#cite_note-:0-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism#cite_note-2) The goal of this is usually to direct [spirits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-physical_entity) or [spiritual energies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_(esotericism)) into the physical world for the purpose of healing, [divination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination), or to aid human beings in some other way.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism#cite_note-:0-1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfbtsd897a9c0bbr86rf4d0))
	- Despite structural implications of colonialism and imperialism that have limited the ability of Indigenous peoples to practice traditional spiritualities, many communities are undergoing resurgence through self-determination[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism#cite_note-38) and the reclamation of dynamic traditions.[[39](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism#cite_note-39) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfc4ycj2mq7629fw1m7tcf4))

	- [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato) wrote in his *[Phaedrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedrus_(dialogue))* that the "first prophecies were the words of an oak", and that those who lived at that time found it rewarding enough to "listen to an oak or a stone, so long as it was telling the truth".

	- **Drums** – The [drum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum) is used by shamans of several peoples in Siberia.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism#cite_note-77)[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism#cite_note-78) The beating of the drum allows the shaman to achieve an altered state of consciousness or to travel on a journey between the physical and spiritual worlds. Much fascination surrounds the role that the acoustics of the drum play to the shaman. Shaman drums are generally constructed of an animal-skin stretched over a bent wooden hoop, with a handle across the hoop. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfc8e08zm0ysn26ngxs579m))

	- According to Winkelman, shamanism develops reliably in human societies because it provides valuable benefits to the practitioner, their group, and individual clients. In particular, the trance states induced by dancing, hallucinogens, and other triggers are hypothesized to have an "integrative" effect on cognition, allowing communication among mental systems that specialize in [theory of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind), social intelligence, and natural history.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism#cite_note-107) With this cognitive integration, the shaman can better predict the movement of animals, resolve group conflicts, plan migrations, and provide other useful services.

	- A debated etymology of the word "shaman" is "one who knows",[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism#cite_note-Diószegi_1962:13-11)[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism#cite_note-Hoppál_2005:14-121) implying, among other things, that the shaman is an expert in keeping together the multiple [codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code) of the society, and that to be effective, shamans must maintain a comprehensive view in their mind which gives them certainty of [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism#cite_note-cogmap-10) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfcgm4ntqvt2tcyv9xqmjwt))
