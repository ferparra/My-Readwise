	- People think the US and China are fighting because they are too DIFFERENT.
	  
	  The philosopher René Girard thinks they are fighting because they are too SIMILAR.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- People conceive of China and the US as opposites:
	  
	  Confucius vs. Plato
	  East vs. West
	  Communism vs. Capitalism
	  Collective vs. Individual
	  Harmony vs. Liberty
	  
	  Girard thinks that these are "False Differences" – political slogans erected by both sides to justify their aggression.

	- Instead, Girard believes that the PRIMARY causes of conflict are the two nation's similarities:
	  
	  • Technological
	  • Achievement-focused
	  • Education-obsessed
	  • Hard-working
	  • Ambitious
	  • Competitive
	  • Militaristic
	  • This-worldly
	  • Strong sense of historical mission

	- Girard thinks that China and the US are "Warring Twins."
	  
	  Not that there is no meaningful difference between the nations but that this difference is not the real cause of conflict and is overblown when compared to the vast similarities. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608221350501707776))
	- "Warring Twins" are sworn enemies who conceive of themselves as radically different, but appear indistinguishable to a neutral third-party:
	  
	  The Greeks and the Trojans
	  Caesar and Pompey
	  Venice And Genoa
	  Montague and Capulet
	  Romulus and Remus
	  The Dutch and the English ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608221353123143680))
	- With historical distance we now see these sworn enemies ^ as very similar.
	  
	  The Dutch and the English saw themselves as radically different, but we see them as almost identical colonial powers with similar economic systems, values, desires, ambitions, and biases.

	- Warring twins fight each other, believing themselves to be champions of some unique characteristic but are blinded to the fact that the main reason they are fighting is because they desire the same things.
	  
	  Sameness rather than difference is the cause of conflict for Girard. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608221362598084608))
	- And so, in 2007, Girard predicted that the economic liberalization of China would lead to conflict and not harmony.
	  
	  The very mechanism which others thought would strengthen relations would be, for Girard, the very channel of aggression: trade. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608221365240487936))
	- We must remember how contrarian such an anticipation of conflict was.
	  
	  20-30 years ago, most believed that economic liberalization would westernize China and assimilate it into the Western global order.
	  
	  This headline captures the spirit of the times:

	- This belief of greater harmony was based on two flawed premises grounded on an unrealistic, homo-economicus view of human nature that so pervades our culture. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608221374593785856))
	- FIRST
	  
	  People believed that China's rise would lift the boats of the world economy, that Americans would be happy with cheaper goods, and the Chinese would be satisfied with more absolute wealth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608221377169092608))
	- SECOND
	  
	  The convergence of values would lead to political harmony.
	  
	  As the Chinese start watching western movies, idolizing American sports, sending their kids to the Ivy League, purchasing western luxury brands, our desires will be closer aligned and, thus, lead to peace. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608221379819892739))
	- Girard's mimetic understanding of human nature allowed him to see the flaw in both premises.
	  
	  We aren't homo-economicus: rationals agents maximizing an objective utility function.
	  
	  We are social, spirited animals prone to comparison and resentment, motivated by pride and envy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608221382491648000))
	- TO THE FIRST POINT
	  
	  Girard believed that Americans would be more insecure even if everyone became absolutely more wealthy but the relative gap between US and China diminished.
	  
	  And the Chinese would be more competitive and envious as they approached US standards of living.

	- What we care about most isn't the absolute quantity of goods but our relative social standing.
	  
	  And we much more readily compete with those close to us than those far out of our league.
	  
	  Envy is a sentiment reserved for equals. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608221393212313602))
	- TO THE SECOND POINT
	  
	  It is similarity in values and desires rather than difference which leads individuals and groups into conflict.
	  
	  This convergence of desires opens a large surface area of competition: luxury brands, real estate, college admissions, technology ... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608221395825352704))
	- Girard's surprising conclusion is that China HAS successfully westernized.
	  
	  And it is BECAUSE of this westernization – that it now desires what the west desires – that we are headed towards conflict.
	  
	  It's not that economic liberalization didn't work, it worked too well! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608221398383853568))
	- Girard, in his own words:
	  
	  "A conflict between the United States and China will follow: everything is in place, though it will not necessarily occur on the military level at first … Trade can transform very quickly into war ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608221401013702658))
	- … From this point of view, we can reasonably fear a major clash between China and the United States in coming decades … [this] looming conflict between the United States and China has nothing to do with a 'clash of civilizations,' ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1608221403605794816))
	- … In fact, the dispute is between two forms of capitalism that are becoming MORE AND MORE SIMILAR."
