	  Good PMs are detail-obsessed, making sure that the product meets the desired quality bar for launch. Great PMs pay this degree of attention to the entire customer experience: they know that the docs, the API, blog post, website, support emails, etc. are also “the product”. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249039984071344128))

	- 11/
	  Good PMs write detailed and lucid product requirements documents (PRDs). Their teams become highly reliant on these PRDs to make forward progress on engineering & design tasks. Great PMs iteratively write their PRDs so engineering & design tasks are rarely blocked on them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249039986386583553))
	- 12/
	  Good PMs work hard, are always extremely busy, and are often overwhelmed. Great PMs work hard but are rarely overwhelmed.

	- 14/
	  Good PMs over time converge on a set of tools & processes that they trust—sprints, OKRs, RICE,... Good PMs introduce these to all their teams for better execution. Great PMs are more adaptive—they have a wider repertoire that they expertly tweak for each specific team's needs ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249040877290270721))
	- 15/
	  Good PMs understand the value of infra-work, but they advocate for more eng time to be spent on features that meet customer needs. Great PMs advocate for infra & tech debt work because they care as much about uptime, latency, dev productivity as they do about new feature-work ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249040878108205057))
	- 16/
	  At product reviews, Good PMs provide thoughtful answers to executives’ questions. Great PMs see their role as being greater than just answering execs’ questions.

	- 19/
	  Good PMs try their best to deliver optimal results for a given product strategy. Great PMs first ensure that the product strategy itself is optimal. Great PMs know that their team’s time is too precious to be squandered away on impeccable execution of a flawed strategy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249040882776432640))
	- 20/

	- 21/
	  When their products do well, Good PMs use the spotlight to give credit to the builders i.e. team members who worked to build the product (eng, design, research, analytics). Great PMs remember to also give credit to the enablers (mktg, legal, sales, support, operations, ...) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249042412464295937))
	- 22/

	- 23/
	  Good PMs weave stakeholder concerns (legal, security, ...) into their plan & get their approval well before launch. Great PMs know that these groups aren’t approvers, they’re advisors. With due consideration, great PMs ultimately decide what’s best for users & the business. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249042414154571776))
	- 24/
	  Good PMs follow & espouse the company’s product principles to build better products & to eliminate decision deadlocks. Great PMs edit the company’s product ethos—they identify the unintended flaws in the principles, fix the flawed parts—and only then follow & espouse it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249042415060582401))
	- 25/
	  Good PMs move heaven and earth to meet their team’s quarterly goals & targets. Great PMs always think a few levels higher than their current place in the org: they will happily sacrifice their team’s goals & targets when it's in favor of the greater good for the company ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249042416297889792))
	- 26/
	  Good PMs are keen students of the company’s PM career ladder; they often evaluate their ladder progression w/ their manager. Great PMs know that career ladders are imperfect proxies: they’re more fixated on tangible competence & impact than on checking off boxes on the ladder ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249042417220632576))
	- 27/
	  Good PMs find a way to motivate themselves to deliver value despite being at odds with the company’s values. Even within rapidly deteriorating cultures, they pledge to go down with the ship. Great PMs know when it’s time to disembark amicably & muster up the courage to do it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249042418336280576))
	- 28/
	  Good PMs seek “PM-driven” companies as a way to make an impact in their role as PMs. Great PMs know that “PM-driven” companies are rarely able to create superb products. Great PMs seek “product-obsessed” companies where Eng-Design-PM-DataScience operate as equals. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249042419158364160))
	- 29/
	  Good PMs constantly learn about the craft of product mgmt through the projects that they take on at work. Great PMs also learn through work projects, but they learn a lot more about their craft in their personal time because of their curiosity & passion for self-improvement. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249042989583720448))
	- 30/
	  Good PMs attain conventional career success at pretty high rates. Great PMs also attain conventional career success. In addition, Great PMs attain a higher form of success: which is to have helped others around them find flow and fulfillment. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249042990393221120))
	- Naturally, very few PMs are Great. 
	  
	  And I don’t know any Great PM who does all of the above, all of the time.
	  
	  That’s because Great PMs know that these ideas should be viewed as signposts, not as commandments. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249042991236304896))
	- If you are a Good PM, you already have the intellectual capacity to become a Great PM.
	  
	  You don’t have to do everything that Great PMs do at once—start with what resonates above, see how that feels, see how that makes others feel, and iterate. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1249042992268070914))
	- If you put in the hard work necessary to become a Great PM, you'll create tremendous career optionality & time optionality for yourself. And you'll leave a long-term imprint on the companies & industries you work in. All on your own terms
	  
	  And for that I wish you all the best!
