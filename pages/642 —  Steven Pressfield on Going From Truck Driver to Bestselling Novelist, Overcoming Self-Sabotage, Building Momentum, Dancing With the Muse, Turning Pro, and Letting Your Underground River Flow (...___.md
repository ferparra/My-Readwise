	  Speaker 1
	  When I finally, finally finished my first novel manuscript, and then there's a word I always have trouble saying after failing, ignominously. Am I getting that right? Oh, I always screw that up. In numerous attempts over the previous 10 years, I was living in a little town in Northern California. Then I tried it down the street to my friend and mentor Paul Rink and told him the triumphant news. Good for you. He said without looking up, start the next one tomorrow. So why did he say that?

	  I'm absolutely a believer in this. You know, sometimes people will ask me, what do you do between books? Yeah. You know, and my answer to that is there should never be a between books. You know, Seth Godin calls it the dip, right? If I understand it right, like the worst thing a writer or a filmmaker or anybody can do. I'm sure you know this, Tim. It's like, finish something, put it out there, and then sort of wait for the world to respond, right? Because they're either not going to respond at all, or they're going to hate it. Right? And meanwhile, you're sitting there driving yourself insane. So I'm definitely a believer that by the time I finish one book, well, let's simply put it differently. As I'm coming towards, say, the last six months on a book, I want to be starting the next book simultaneously. Even if it's only notes so that when I do, like Paul Rink said to me, start the next one tomorrow, you know, or today. Because it's so hard to do that and resistance is so hard, you got to just keep going. ([Time 0:23:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9c22d46b-cc76-4e3a-a99b-7c17dd09b9c0))
