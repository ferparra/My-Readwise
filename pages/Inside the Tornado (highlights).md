document_note:: This document discusses the strategy for success within the technology sector, focusing on how to capitalize on opportunity during a tornado market, which is defined as a period of mass-market adoption when the general marketplace switches over to a new infrastructure paradigm. It is important to note that the winning strategy changes from stage to stage and that it is counterintuitive, as what made one successful at an earlier stage can lead to failure at later stages. The document also outlines the four stages of the technology adoption life cycle: early market, bowling alley, tornado, and main street, and offers insights for each stage. Finally, the document stresses the importance of trust and relinquishing power in order to gain it back in the long run.

	- The winning strategy does not just change as we move from stage to stage, it actually reverses the prior strategy. This is why this is so difficult and counterintuitive - what made you successful at an earlier stage causes failure at later stages. Early stages you must not segment, in the chasm and bowling alley you must segment, in the tornado you must not segment, on main street you must segment ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrgz3aa8g3c2e99kfb5k5g9))
		- **Note**: The strategies for succeeding in the technology adoption lifecycle must be adapted as the business moves from early stages to later ones. At the early stages, it is important to not segment the market, but for the chasm and bowling alley stages, segmentation is necessary. However, when the business reaches the tornado stage, segmentation must be abandoned, and segmentation must be re-instated for the main street stage.
	- **The only way to cross the chasm is to put all your eggs in one basket. That is, key to a winning strategy is to identify a single beachhead of pragmatist customers in a mainstream market segment and to accelerate the formation of 100% of their whole product. The goal is to win a niche foothold in the mainstream as quickly as possible - that is what is meant by crossing the chasm. Then, once in the tornado, you need to quickly switch strategies and gain mass market share at any cost, positioning your products horizontally as global infrastructure**
	  
	  1.  Many leaders are not cut out to lead the company through each of these phases. That's fine and to be expected, but know what stage you're in, what type of CEO you have, and when they might need to be replaced ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrgzdvd85734n6sprve5rqc))

		- **Note**: This text argues that the key to success in the technology industry is to first identify a pragmatic customer base, and then focus on gaining a foothold in the mainstream market. Once in the 'tornado', the goal is to switch strategies and gain a large market share quickly. It is important to recognize the stage the company is in and when the CEO may need to be replaced.
	- For every stage of the technology adoption life cycle, there is an optimal business model
	  
	  1.  early market - professional services.
	  2.  bowling alley - application products
	  3.  tornado - infrastructure products - a period of mass-market adoption when the general marketplace switches over to the new infrastructure paradigm
	  4.  main street - transaction services ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrh0p3nn7hyv6n1cfn54z9n))
	- Overview of the tech adoption lifecyle
	  
	  1.  The forces that operate in the bowling alley argue for a niche-based strategy that is highly customer-centric
	  2.  Those in the tornado push in the opposite direction toward a mass-market strategy for deploying a common standard infrastructure
	  3.  Then on Main St., market forces push back again toward a customer-centric approach, focusing on specific adaptations of this infrastructure for added value through mass customization
	  4.  Given these dramatic reversals in strategy, it is imperative that organizations be able to agree on where their markets are in the life cycle
	  5.  In the meantime, the economic cataclysm of the tornado deconstructs and reconstructs the power structure in the market so rapidly that simply understanding who is friend and who is foe becomes a challenge
	  6.  Within the newly emerging market structure, companies must compete for advantage based on their status within it
	  7.  Positioning in this context consists of a company taking its rightful place in the hierarchy of power and defending it against challengers
	  8.  And finally, moving fluidly from strategy to strategy is the ultimate challenge of any organization, demanding an extraordinarily flexible response from its management team ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrh0y5wb9ebcb5g8jaw73yz))
		- **Note**: The tech adoption lifecycle is a dynamic process that involves shifting customer-centric strategies for deploying common standard infrastructure. This process involves understanding where markets are in the life cycle, deconstructing and reconstructing the power structure in the market, competing for advantage based on status within it, and fluidly moving from strategy to strategy. This requires an agile, flexible response from management teams.
