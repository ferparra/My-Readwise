	- When building systems in general, we are facing the challenge between building the right thing and building the thing right.
	- A subdomain, in the ideal case, can contain one or in some cases also more than one bounded context. A bounded context defines where a single domain model can be applied and forms a unit of purpose, mastering, and autonomy, and a domain model itself that represents the domain logic and business rules that are relevant to that area of the system.
	- To optimize cognitive load, we have to limit the number and size and complexities of software system a single team has to work with.
	- The more unclear the path to action is, the higher the level of cognitive load is.
	- For clear responsibility boundaries, we need to assign each bounded context to a single team and not sharing bounded context across teams, because that would then diffuse the ownership of teams.
	- In order to be able to focus on a fast flow of change, the stream-aligned teams are relying on a platform team providing an easily consumable platform as a service.
	- the combination of Wardley Mapping, domain-driven design, and team topologies that helps to understand the environment an organization is operating and competing in.
