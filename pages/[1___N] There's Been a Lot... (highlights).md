	- [1/n] There's been a lot of hubbub lately about the best known packing of 17 unit squares into a larger square, owing to this post: https://t.co/almLPZtOCj
	  
	  I realized this can be coded up in < 5 minutes in the browser via @UsePenrose, and gave it a try.  Pretty darn close! ðŸ§µ

	- [2/n] To be clear, this ðŸ§µ isn't about finding a better packingâ€”or even finding it faster. Wizards like @KangarooPhysics surely have better tricks up their sleeves ðŸª„
	  
	  Instead, it's about an awesome *tool* for quickly whipping up constraint-based graphics: https://t.co/K2tEkX7EUu ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/keenanisalive/status/1626707734342033411))
	- [3/n] The "17 squares" problem provides a great demonstration of how Penrose works.
	  
	  In fact, if you want to use this thread as a mini-tutorial, you can try it out at https://t.co/6F0GuA0gtQ

	- [4/n] The first step is to just say what type of objects we have in our domain of interest.
	  
	  In this case, there's just one type of object: squares!
	  
	  So, we write "type Square" in the domain tab:

	- [5/n] Next, we need to say how squares should get "styled," i.e., how they should get arranged and drawn.  So, let's open up the style tab:

	- [6/n] The first thing is to just say how large our drawing canvas should be.
	  
	  Since the drawing will be forced to stay on the canvas, we can use the canvas itself as the outer bounding square!
	  
	  The smaller we make the width/height, the harder packing our 17 squares will becomeâ€¦
