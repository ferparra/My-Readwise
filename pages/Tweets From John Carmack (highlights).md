	- The amount of C++ warning diarrhea you get from a wrong parameter on a std::thread is breathtaking.  I also just learned that there is a maximum parameter count for std::thread, and the warnings were... not helpful. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1162062164171075598))
	- I still feel pretty good about the commencement speech I gave a few years ago: https://t.co/Oy0W7K1Bqt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1296180686215417856))
	- wanted to grab him by the shoulders and yell "Focus, damnit!"  Edison isn't as highly regarded today as he used to be, but he Shipped.

	- Much is made of the serendipity of proximity in Silicon Valley. A while back there was a loose collection of companies sometimes referred to as the "Dallas Gaming Mafia". In hindsight, I could have been a more positive force if I got out of hermit mode and socialized some. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1402496694940536834))
	- Remarkable how, twenty minutes after a run, you can think “I should have just kept going” or “I should have just picked up the pace”, completely forgetting how you were dying at the time. We just don’t commit the misery to memory well.  Reportedly pregnancy is also like that. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1416214350172405763))
