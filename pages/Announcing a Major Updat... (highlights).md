	- Announcing a major update to Perplexity Ask: the world’s first conversational search engine! Now, you can read answers with up-to-date sources and ask follow-up questions to dig deeper. In other words, you can chat with your search engine!

		- **Note**: Thread
	- For each follow-up question, Ask seamlessly converts your question into a new search query. No need to rephrase your question or think of keywords - simply ask a new question.

	- There’s a lot of discussion around the right interface to search in the age of LLMs: whether it’s a single Google-style search box or a new experience. We’re working towards a conversational answer engine: i.e. ChatGPT + latest references pulled from a search engine. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai/status/1616121484552081409))
