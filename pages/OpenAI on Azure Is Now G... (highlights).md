- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Feb 5th, 2023]]
	- OpenAI on Azure is now generally available.
	  
	  Here's why you may want to use it (and also why you may not) https://t.co/O3jBCq8G2y ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/humanloop/status/1615252004447850496))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Higher Rate limit on code
	  
	  1200 RPM on the codex models compared to just... 20 with OpenAI
	  
	  (although still not the full 3k per minute for davinci-003)

	- Fine tuned models at scale
	  
	  Instead of a 4-5x higher per-token fee, you pay an hourly rate for hosting fine tuned models.
	  
	  This gets economical at scale. And at scale you'll definitely want to be fine tuning.
	  
	  (though wow at the jump for hosting Davinci vs Curie)

	- Terms of use
	  
	  With Azure looks like if you comply with automated monitoring, you can opt of third party access (tbc: not legal advice, these are just tweets)

	- Regional availability
	  
	  If your data needs to stay in Europe (for GDPR) or stay in the US (to avoid that) you can specify that.
	  
	  For latency it also makes sense to colocate with your servers and users as much as possible.
	  
	  (Currently in West Europe, East US + South Central US)

	- Enterprise security and availability
	  
	  VPN, ISO, SOC2, HIPPA and many more acronyms (iykyk). Also you'll get some credit back if the service gets swamped which is a nice change.
