	- “Mental training and visualization cannot replace execution of real world cognitive or motor tasks you want to learn…but is effective in enhancing the speed at which you learn and the stability of that learning over time.” *– Dr. Andrew Huberman* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzcmaxj6wqrz1z2sv7dyrhrb))
	- Principles of mental visualization:
	  
	  •   (1) mental visualization needs to be brief (15-20 sec) and repeated;
	  
	  •   (2) mental visualization needs to be combined with real world experience;
	  
	  •   (3) mental training needs to be similar to real world experience;
	  
	  •   (4) naming and giving identity to real world skill and applying the same name to visualization enhances learning;
	  
	  •   (5) it takes longer to perform complex motor sequences in mental training and visualization just like it would in the real world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzcmb4cqwqvdepnza5nyzaf3))
	- **Types of neuroplasticity:**
	  
	  •   **Developmental neuroplasticity** is a passive plasticity that takes place between birth and 25 years old; it evokes changes in the nervous system simply by engaging in the world
	  
	  •   **Self-directed adult neuroplasticity** starts in early adolescence and extends through the rest of life and is directed toward specific learning (motor or cognitive) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzcmbeh204gcb15bfgncvcf2))
		- **Note**: Neuroplasticity can be passive or directed.
	- Most people cannot imagine long, extended scenes that goes on for several minutes; we’re best at visualization, mental training, or auditory sequences that last about 15 seconds ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzcmc7ba8yjess5was48qdcp))
	- **Mental training dose:** 50-75 repetitions per session, 2-8 times per week – stop when you feel satisfied with translation in real world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzcmckg1srg7w8me95t9xqkc))
