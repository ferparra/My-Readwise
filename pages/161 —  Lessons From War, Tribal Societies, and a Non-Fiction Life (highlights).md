	  Ah, god, i a, i really dislike laziness. And if you you read a phrase or a sentence that's familiar, i there are these clichets, these sort of sort of linguistic tropes like the mortars slammed into the hillside. I just don't want to read that again. You know, i just say it in an original way, or don't say it. But you're wasting everybody's time, including your own, if you write and rely on these sort of linguistic tropes. I really, i really dislike that. And, um, also, the the point of journalism is the truth. It's night. I was talking about this on the phone earlier, and, you know, maybe you overheard me, buti but it ita, the point o journalism is the truth. The point of journalism is not to improve society. And there are things, there are facts, there are truths, that actually feel regressive, but it doesn't matter, because the ofjournalism isn't to make everything better. It's to give people accurate information about how things are. And i think journalists really confuse those two things. Advocates are what we need for improvement, but not journalists. Journalists provide information, like doctors provide information when they look at your the ex ray of your lungs after you smoke for ten years.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  They need accurate forensic that's right. Yes, it's right.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  What do you, your 70 year old self, would give to your current self as advice, i think i would say to myself that the the world is the continually unfolding set of possibilities and opportunities. And the tricky thing about life is, on the one hand, having the courage to enter into things that are unfamiliar, butto also have the wisdom to, like, stop exploring when you've found something that's worth sticking around for. That's true of a place, of a persono, of a vocation, o in balancing those two things, the courage of ploring and the a commitment to staying thatif you get the it's very, very hard to get those twothe the ratio, the balance of those two things right. And i think my 70 year old self would say, just really be careful that you don't err on one side or the other because you have an ill conceived idea of who you are. It's thi fine line.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  It's a tough, a tough, tough balance. Yes, it isi find tough.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Personally, i mean, absolutely. I means a lot of unhappy people because they're struggling to find that balance.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  How do you what are the symptoms of knowing that you should pursue a given project because you've got an avajo long distance running. You have the perfect storm. You have, i yet quit quite a bit of terrain that you cover. How do you know? I whatsfad. And i'll just throw it out there to a as an example. For me, i find writing so difficult personally. And i'm so plotting, and i have to go into isolation. It makes me very mentally unhealthy. I only write a book, certainly, if it's less painful to write it than to not write it.
