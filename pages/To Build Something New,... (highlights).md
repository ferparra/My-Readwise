		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ When building the altMBA, @ThisIsSethsBlog and I didn’t look at edtech. That was too narrow.
	  
	  We studied what makes ppl feel *zealous, committed & becomes part of their identity*
	  
	  In this thread, I will share the groups we analyzed for inspiration and what we learned: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1441478052014399490))
	- 2/ Religion
	  
	  External signals of group belonging:
	- 3/ Military
	- 4/ CrossFit
	  
	  Opposite of Fight Club: The first rule of CrossFit is always talk about CrossFit. Builds word of mouth & brand awareness.
	  
	  “Paleo this, paleo that...”
	  
	  “Ppl like us work out until we puke. We don’t need a fancy gym.”
	  
	  Inspired ways to increase altMBA’s word of mouth ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1441478058519801856))
	- 5/ Tough Mudder
	  
	  Anyone who’s done Tough Mudder started telling their coworkers 6 months before actual event.
	  
	  Intentional extreme factor: mini electric shocks while crawling in mud.
	  
	  Creates conversation topic in the kitchenette. Makes participant look hardcore, elevates status ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1441478060792975364))
	- 6/ Dance-a-thons
	  
	  Popular in the US in the 1920s & 1930s. Concentrated endurance contests, gathered community in one spot for an intense sprint. Some for 100+ hours straight.
	  
	  Attracted people who were slightly masochistic. Inspired altMBA workshop structure of intense sprinting ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1441478063464669187))
	- 7/ Cults
	  
	  [Analyzed using an ethical lens.]
	  
	  Love bombing to overwhelm a student with support if they’re feeling down.
	  
	  Inspired leaning into the altMBA’s internal language:
	- 8/ Startup Weekend
	  
	  A 54 hour weekend event, during which groups form teams w/strangers and develop a working prototype to present by Sunday evening.
	  
	  Inspired the intense deadlines of shipping a project within a day with your altMBA learning group of the week. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1441478073287942149))
	- 9/ Landmark
	- 10/ Fraternities
	- 11/ Harvard
	- 12/ Alcoholics Anonymous
	  
	  [This one gets multiple tweets bc it was a big influence on my thinking]
	- 13/ AA: Controlled anarchy
	  
	  Each AA group could set its own rules as long as they didn’t conflict with the traditions or the steps.
	  
	  Inspired deliberate looseness and ambiguity in certain parts of the altMBA. Posture of co-creation with students ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1441478083916275713))
	- 14/ AA: Group = key
	  
	  AA’s effectiveness may have nothing to do w/ actual steps.
	  
	  Stanford research showed “members develop close bonds w/other members & are deeply influenced by their acceptance and feedback.”
	  
	  Inspired ways to normalize positive, generous behavior in students ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1441478085921046531))
	- 15/ AA: Driven by peers
	  
	  AA meetings aren’t led by professionals so it fosters a sense of intimacy btwn members. Participation is associated w/ increased sense of security, comfort, and mutuality.
	  
	  Inspired peer-driven structure of altMBA and psychological closeness ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1441478087988940805))
	- 16/ AA: Idea of fragile sobriety

	- 17/ AA: Rituals and routines
	  
	  Frequent meetings were important for AA. If meetings were only offered once a while, it would be too easy to lose the habit.
	  
	  Inspired various rituals, habits, and routines for students during 4 week workshop & after as alumni ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1441478095110868992))
