document_note:: Nassim Taleb's book "Antifragile: Things that Gain from Disorder" examines the concept of antifragility, in which things are made stronger through difficult times. He argues that nature is the ultimate example of this and that suppressing randomness can actually harm antifragile things. He also argues that long-term forecasting is prone to error and discusses the need to move towards simplicity to make things more antifragile. Taleb also emphasizes the importance of exposure to randomness, making decisions based on evidence rather than theory, and avoiding mistakes. He also warns against taking too much advice from those with no skin in the game.

- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Feb 16th, 2023]]
	- Anything that has more upside than downside during random events has antifragility ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvhsme9mqpayafmwmk71h8))
	- Moving towards simplicity and removing things makes things more antifragile than adding anything ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvhz176ve7fwya4nxbtnrp))
	- Central illusion in life – **randomness is risky. Man made smoothing of randomness makes things more fragile. Daily variability helps strengthen a person or system** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvj9nqpq3w9jr020jf51pn))
	- **Time is the worlds best debunker of fragility** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvjk91vfnta104bm05s263))
	- You are antifragile when you have more to gain than lose from volatility – more upside than downside. First decrease your exposure to downside ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvjsgf2cmtapd43y07nf93))
	- **Tinkering and iterations are much more antifragile than blueprints and hard plans**. This allows for more optionality and better decisions since will have better information ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvjzhabtdca0gzc780zsp1))

		- **Note**: Tinkering and trying different things are much better than having a strict plan when it comes to being antifragile. This means you will have more choices and be able to make better decisions because you will have more information.
	- **Robust decisions rarely require more than one good reason**. The man with the most alibis is usually guilty. In addition, a man should be known for one great idea ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvmqest1b1tnw1znp0df7n))
		- **Note**: If you have to make an important decision, it's best to have just one good reason to make it. Usually, if someone has a lot of excuses, they're probably guilty. It's better to be known for one really good idea than for a lot of average ones.
	- There is logic in nature much deeper than we can often understand ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvnx609k80t7sak7n21tkd))
	- Absence of skin in the game is truly hurting the antifragile systems since people can get the upside without any of the downside and exposing others ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvp9nypyjq3tq965rhwqgn))

	- Complex systems are often more fragile but regardless simplicity is key ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvx23sj2dqpq3084fbgem0))
	- Domain dependence – can make contradictory claims or thoughts depending on the context ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvxh29hr8zxsrgc9642s9e))
	- Overcompensation and “noise” are necessary for people to grow and learn ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvxbekv71mxfcpw5vt7xvp))
	- Redundancy is often a great investment and can often be very efficient (2 kidneys) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvx852pafa6dyf6e3zk4z6))
	- Often stronger once have made a mistake than if never have made one ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvxvqy86vt61bsn8ag64dm))
	- Injecting randomness strengthens systems ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvya1033jgd7sbn651the4))
	- Wisdom in making decisions is vastly more important than knowledge. [Seneca](https://blas.com/letters-from-a-stoic-by-lucius-annaeus-seneca/) is a prime example of this ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvypyzvxvsdtb1z00x9rhr))

	- [Stoicism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) is extremely robust. Possessions make us worry about downside and make us fragile. Mentally adjust for the worst before it happens and everything positive from then on will seem like a bonus. Stoicism about the domestication and not the elimination of emotions. Invest in good deeds as things can be taken away ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscvz5yaaebezptf5a454tcp))

	- Randomness plays two roles – innovation and implementation. The implementation of a tool or medicine does not always immediately succeed its invention (the period between is the translational gap) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscw0amjdxt7hytrvc5137e8))
	- Do not get too technical and smart for your own good – keep the elementary in mind ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscw0hyh1z2z1krc0cm4f7bt))
	- Tinkering and trial and error is robust and antifragile to the unknown ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscw0n08xn1tdy4va89a3f1e))
	- Look and rank things according to optionality, options with open ended and not closed ended payoffs, do not invest in business plans but in people, make sure you are “barbelled” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscw0xqnrhcpe8tz528wgdgc))

	- Lindy effect- books that have been around the longest will survive the longest ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscw1tzd8te0mwr6ccn4kcb5))
	- We only understand risks after they happen but continually make the mistake of thinking we can risk manage. The risks come from what we cannot see ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscw23vnaj6cq92jq2ra5bk2))

	- Every risk taker needs to have some skin in the game – Hammurabi’s code. No opinion without risk. This is becoming rare in today’s world where bankers and politicians can make decisions which affect millions but they themselves don’t pay if they’re wrong ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscw2ke2y1bz27avky5m9a7z))
