	- The Dark Side of Psychology🧵
	  
	  In 1928, a professor wrote a parenting guide
	  
	  It became a best-seller
	  
	  Then 3 of his 4 kids committed suicide
	  
	  Meet John Watson: the father of Behaviorism
	  
	  A story of scientific arrogance, the meaning of love, and 1 expert who was very, very wrong👇🏻 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1612541283519823872))

	- 1/ Dr. John Watson was a man of bold claims
	  
	  He believed he could turn a random infant into “any type of specialist” from doctor to artist to a thief - “regardless of his talents, tendencies, abilities”
	  
	  How?
	  
	  With psychological conditioning and other tools of behaviorism ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1612541410447884289))
	- 2/ John Watson shared these tools with the world in a book co-written with his wife: 
	  
	  “Psychological Care Of Infant and Child”
	  
	  “Society” comes up 8 times
	  
	  The “environment” 10 times
	  
	  The “soul” 0 times
	  
	  Among other things, the book says a mother’s love is “dangerous”

	- 3/ The book’s central chapter: “Too Much Mother Love”
	  
	  Which apparently inflicts a “never healing wound” upon kids
	  
	  Makes adolescence a “nightmare” 
	  
	  And destroys the child’s future employability and “happiness”
	  
	  Watson: “Never hug and kiss them, never let them sit on your lap.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1612541807027703808))
	- 4/ Watson taught millions that showing love to kids without reason sets up bad INCENTIVES
	  
	  The world doesn’t comfort a person for crying, so neither should a mother
	  
	  Parents must be “objective, and free from sentiment”
	  
	  Watson walked his talk
	  
	  Let’s check in on his kids… ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1612541919904796672))
	- 5/ Years after Watson’s death, his son gave a tell-all interview:
	  
	  “We were never shown any kind of emotional closeness. It was absolutely verboten in the family”
	  
	  Getting close to parents was “taboo”
	  
	  3/4 of Watson’s kids, from 2 different marriages, tried suicide
	  
	  One succeeded ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1612542159634460673))
	- 6/ Watson’s wife had doubts about her famous husband's “wisdom”
	  
	  She once revealed her “secret wish” - that “her sons have a tear in their eyes for the poetry and drama of life and a throb for romance”
	  
	  BUT in practice she toe’d her husband’s line even when he “wasn’t looking” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1612542478795800576))
	- 7/ Watson’s son:
	  
	  “My reason for entering therapy was an attempted suicide. I strongly believe that strict adherence to the principles of behaviorism tends to erode the fundamental development of the child’s ego strength and to cause a great deal of difficulty in later life.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1612542587218587648))
	- 8/ Watson’s kids were never allowed to switch on the “night lights” no matter the thunder storms outside
	  
	  They weren’t allowed toys either
	  
	  Their sex ed started at 7
	  
	  They would later find out that their father always “slept with the light on because of his own dread of the dark” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1612542699546247168))
	- 9/ Watson’s blindspot is the blindspot of modernity 
	  
	  Above all he cared about “independence” and “non involvement”
	  
	  He believed kids shouldn’t “know their own parents” and could be better brought up in communal homes
	  
	  Today the world suffers from this atomized vision of humanity ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1612542816177254400))
	- 10/ Parenting shouldn’t be an “instinctive art,” Watson said, but a “science”
	  
	  Millions of years of evolutionary experience do not count
	  
	  Only lab results count
	  
	  He wanted the world to “stop having children for twenty years” until the “facts” were found with “patient lab methods” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1612542916773437440))

	- For Watson, love was unearned validation that promoted mediocrity
	  
	  But love is actually unearned faith, and faith is ALWAYS unearned
	  
	  To be loved is to have someone presuppose value and latent greatness in you without proof - the foundation of self-esteem
	  
	  As GK Chesterton said:

	- Watson should have read Nietzsche
	  
	  It would've done his children and his readers a favor
	  
	  Nietzsche asks: Why would you trust your conscious reason, the newest part of your brain, over the oldest - your instincts?
	  
	  Nietzsche on Reason v/s Instincts:
