document_note:: David Deutsch argues that humans are the only known physical system capable of creating knowledge, which is the ultimate form of knowledge creation. He argues that the human way of creating knowledge is the most powerful, as it allows for the creation of knowledge that is not necessarily based on viable things. He also discusses how knowledge leads to wealth creation and how humans are universal quantum computers capable of making good explanations with narrow and risky predictions. He also states that nonlocality plays a part in the creation of knowledge, as it is where misconceptions can come in.

That’s this idea that repeated observation is what leads you to the creation of new knowledge—and that’s not the case at all. This came from [Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper), but you built upon it. You talk about how humans are very different and exceptional and how knowledge creation is a very exceptional thing that only happens in evolution and the human brain as far as we know. You talk about how the earth is not this hospitable, fragile spaceship earth biome that supports us, but rather it’s something that we engineer and we build to sustain us.
