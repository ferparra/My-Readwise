	- The Art of Iteration
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Revision is important, and it's important to keep in mind the "progress" that you're making., * It's important to have patience when working on something, and to be able to step away from it periodically in order to give your ideas a chance to "cool off."., * It's also important to be aware of the "rules" of revision, and to be willing to experiment with different approaches.)

	  I've really been enjoying the fiction what I have found myself running into is I will have a short short story a few pages long and I will revise it 47 times I'll revise it 56 times and when I look at the amount of time I've spent on it a few things become apparent number one is that I'm not convinced revision 56 is any better necessarily than revision 49 so maybe I could have spent less time on that and done more original drafting and then the second is when I look at something that many times it all begins to get blurry and it becomes so familiar that I it's very challenging to look at it with fresh eyes and I imagine that happens to folks you work with maybe it happened to you in this creative process what advice would you give say me or how

	  Would you talk through that with me if I'm experiencing those things first thing I would suggest is always referring back to the thing that you're revising I would never assume because you put more time into something it's getting better yeah most people equate work time with progress and that's not the case we're scientists experimenting and it's all an experiment and sometimes we get the experiment right right at the beginning and we don't know it and we won't know it until we may do a hundred other iterations that are not better so what I'll say is there's no way to save the time that you're hoping to save there are no shortcuts you got to do the hundred experiments no matter what even if you get it right the first time it's the only way to know yeah and in addition to that I would add On top of it having patience and being able to step away long enough that you can compare idea 56 your latest with idea one iteration one at the beginning and see is it in fact better because sometimes I mean there's a whole history of albums that have come out where people always say oh the album didn't really work but the demos were great you know it was so much better the songwriting was great but we didn't really execute it right so the craft part of iteration after iteration could just as well be making it worse as better it also can be making it better it's like there's no rule to it so that's why it's dangerous and then in terms of staying present and leaving the work and working on something else is a really good thing to do because then when you come back You've really exhausted another part of your brain you know work on something hard not that and then when you come back to read it you have a better chance of being closer to a neutral view ([Time 0:20:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bb32a6f4-1ea0-4210-a782-dc4399c92ae8))

	  Saying it's like we're not all great at everything so if we get great at the thing that we're great at and if we get great at the thing that we're great at that not so many other people are great at in the way that we are and that's usually the case with music like the reason there are so many musical artists and the reason you know i have thousands of albums of artists and thousands of artists that i follow that i love isn't because they're all the best one it's they all do something really good particular to them and i want the one who really does the good thing particular to them and johnnie rimone can't play guitar like eric clapton but he can play guitar like johnnie rimone and i'm good with that i'm good with both do you know what i'm saying i
