	- ChatGPT is incredibly powerful as a tutor. I used it this morning for it to teach me more about Kalman filters, had it explain the equations to me, had it cast it into Python & Numpy since I learn better from code. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bradneuberg/status/1606688451730239490))

	- Last night I had it go deeper into using AVX/AVX512 in Python with Numba, asking it questions about specific usage, then had it write a similar CUDA kernel for NVIDIA GPUs to compare & contrast. Basically a person tutor, incredible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bradneuberg/status/1606688454452326401))
