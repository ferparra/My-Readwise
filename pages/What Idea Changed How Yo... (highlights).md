	- The best example of high agency:
	  
	  The guy in this video.
	  
	  Watch how the low-agency crowd goes from judgmental to joining in, once everyone else deems it acceptable. https://t.co/KqZXrcKHTj ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1642197578476568576))
	- What is high agency?
	  
	  @EricRWeinstein was the first person I heard about it from.
	  
	  It's one of those ideas that once you see it, you can't unsee it.

	- High agency is the following 3 things merged into one mega trait:
	  
	  1. Resourcefulness
	  2. Skepticism towards "best practices"
	  3. Locus of control
	  
	  E.g. The Wright Brothers

	- Josh Waitzkin argues that "Good weather" and "Bad weather" is one of the first low agency conditioning mechanisms.
	  
	  Most parents - "It's bad weather. We can't go outside"
	  
	  Josh Waitzkin - "It's a beautiful rainy day. Let's go outside"
	  
	  Josh uses the weather to teach agency.

	- The best question I've seen for identifying the highest agency person you know:
	  
	  • If I was stuck in a 3rd world prison and had to call someone to get me out, who would I call? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1642197609489244160))
	- Here's a list of common traits high agency people tend to have:

	- Here's an example of mass low agency:
	  
	  We put a man on the moon before we put wheels on luggage
	  
	  Everyone accepted suitcases without wheels as the best practice - because everyone else did
	  
	  The greatest minds of their generation used to carry their suitcases until the 1970s

	- One thought experiment to guarantee a sleepless night:
	  
	  "What is the suitcase without wheels in 2023?"
	  
	  What is the stupid idea society passively accepts because everyone else in society does it? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1642197626295816192))
	- Dick Fosbury is an iconic example of High agency.
	  
	  He was an average high jumper that won a gold medal by changing the rules of the game.
	  
	  He was mocked before the games for looking like a camel. Now his method is the universal way of doing the high jump.

	- Hiroji Satoh was the worst player on the Japanese table tennis team. He then became the world champion
	  
	  How? Adding foam to his bat changed the ball's trajectory
	  
	  The low-agency crowd will mock the high-agency individual but ultimately joins once the crowd deems it acceptable

	- The High-agency individual can outperform bureaucratic low-agency organizations.
	  
	  A solo IRS inspector beat the FBI and CIA to find the founder of Silk Road (Dark web site) with...
	  
	  *Google Search*.

	- The most underrated high agency example is Vrba & Wetzler.
	  
	  1. Escaped Auschwitz.
	  2. Walked 80 miles in stolen suits.
	  3. Carried the first-ever report on the gas chambers.
	  
	  They reportedly saved *200,000* people from dying in the Holocaust.
	  
	  This should be a Hollywood blockbuster
