	- ðŸ§µ Thread about anxiety.  (I specialized in treating anxiety as a cognitive therapist.)  I firmly believe, based on 20+ years of experience, that the most basic problem with anxiety is that our society does not have adequate words/concepts to understand how our emotions work.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- Our "folk psychology", the concepts we all use in daily life, is not fit for purpose in this regard.  Two main reasons.  1. We fail to distinguish between different forms that anxiety can take, whereas the first thing competent researchers/clinicians do is a diagnosis.

	- Panic attacks are different from animal phobias, and different from PTSD anxiety, and different from generalized anxiety, or social anxiety, and so on.  Different types of anxiety function differently and respond to different treatments.  Most people are confused about this. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DonJRobertson/status/1502353942856048650))
	- 2. We fail to distinguish between different aspects of anxiety, researchers sometimes call this the "lump" model, i.e., we talk as if "anxiety" is just a homogenous thing rather than a complex process with moving parts, e.g., cognitive, affective, behavioural elements etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DonJRobertson/status/1502353945305690112))
	- The most damaging consequence of this (frankly) ignorance is that most people fail to distinguish between voluntary and involuntary aspects of their emotions, which is an absolutely crippling mistake to make psychologically.

	- They struggle to control (usually suppress) automatic reactions, which is known to backfire and increase vulnerability.  And they neglect to take ownership for voluntary aspects (such as perseverative thinking) which could potentially cure their problem.

	- The cognitive aspect of anxiety has long been analyzed following Richard Lazarus' "transactional" model of stress, which was incorporated into Aaron T. Beck's original cognitive model of anxiety.  It easily breaks down into simple elements of appraisal. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DonJRobertson/status/1502353950208634888))
	- In most anxiety there's an exaggerated appraisal of (1) threat in terms both of the (1a) probability and (1b) severity of threat.  (Possibly also how "looming" or imminent it is.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DonJRobertson/status/1502353953090064384))
	- That has to combine, though, with an underestimate of (2) coping ability, i.e., poor confidence (self-efficacy), motivation, commitment, range of options, etc.  This aspect is overlooked by many people, for some reason. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DonJRobertson/status/1502353954457460741))
	- In plain English: anxiety happens when you believe that something catastrophic is probably going to happen imminently and you don't know how you're going to cope.  Repetitive circular thinking like that defines the "worrying" cognitive style. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DonJRobertson/status/1502353956730814465))
	- But the most important message is this: worrying is fragile.  Most people don't realize how fragile worrying is, though - why not?  Because they think and talk about it too simplistically and fail to realize that it is composed of parts, some of which are under voluntary control.

	- If our society learned to talk in a more emotionally literate way about how anxiety (and other feelings) actually work, making very simple conceptual distinctions, we would absolutely transform our experience of emotion, and free our children from a great deal of suffering.
