	- Continuing my adventures in e-ink, I had the idea in the weekend to have DallE-2 generate custom images for the weather conditions on the fly! It works surprisingly well!

	- To make this work I combine both the ChatGPT and DallE APIs as sending over  a word like “cloudy” will get a boring result.
	  
	  GPT makes a good prompt for DallE based on the single word weather, then I send that to DallE to generate the image. Here’s an example prompt I get back:
