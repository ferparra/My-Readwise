	- Self Acceptance is a Game Changer
	  
	  Summary:
	  Self acceptance is about owning your behaviour in a way that basically dissipates shame. I think you're also seeing this play out more controversially in the setrans movement. You know, i'm a lot of these individuals a who have gender identities that are extraordinarily mismatched to their physical bodies. That experience is disorientig f for people t question. What's controversial is, what do you do with that? Do you call yourself a different gender, or do you deal with it in other ways? And that's openf for discussion, i think, debate. But nevertheless, if you can have self acceptance over the fact that you are out there, you know, on a bell curve

	  Man. Shame is a it plays a role in so much of the work i do in my life. Like, i'm really interested in lake ner diversity, for instance. A really one to champion a people who brains, whose brains are wired in all sorts of different ways, from like agton spectrum to like, a by por disorderto, alex skitsoprantia, like like, having a self acceptance for having a uniquely wired brain is a game changer for these individuals. I think you're also seeing this play out more controversially in the setrans movement. You know, i'm a lot of these individuals a who have gender identities that are extraordinarily mismatched to their physical bodies. And that, by the way, that is a real ific thing that can happen, for your psychological gender to differ so dramatically from your physical genitaria that you, that experience is disorientig f for people t question. What's controversial is, what do you do with that? Do you call yourself a different gender, or do you deal with it in other ways? And that's openf for discussion, i think, debate. But nevertheless, if you can have self acceptance over the fact that you are out there, you know, on a bell curve, extr in an extreme way, and you can get self acceptance for that, that's a huge game changer for them as well. Imean, that's tis. That what we're all craving in a wiy there's a sort of common humanity there. I'm trying to even thoun bringing up these desperate examples of these diverse examples. We're all human at the end of the day. And whenever we have any sort of extreme trait or something that puts us out in a bell curve, to have self acceptance for that and to not have shame over it, is going to be a huge part of that self accusation process.
