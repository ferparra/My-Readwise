	- Consistency, convergence, and confluence are not the same! Eventual consistency and eventual convergence aren't the same as confluence, either.
	- Convergence is a definition based on eventual state.
	- Confluence is a definition based on behavior and program outputs.
	- Confluence is about inputs and outputs to a function. A function is confluent if the outputs it produces do not change when the order of the inputs changes.
	- Convergence is about the state of a replica when it is merged with other replicas. But what does state mean? From my perspective, the state of a replica is defined by the outputs it will produce in response to future inputs.
