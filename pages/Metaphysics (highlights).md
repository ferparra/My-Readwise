	- **Metaphysics** is the branch of [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) that studies the fundamental nature of [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality), the first principles of being, identity and change, space and time, causality, necessity, and possibility. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyz3rdfvyfkc79w6rq70t23))
	- It includes questions about the nature of [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) and the relationship between [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind) and [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter), between [substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_theory) and [attribute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_(philosophy)), and between [potentiality and actuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiality_and_actuality). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyz41jngsnbv8k8c82ag51j))
	- Metaphysical study is conducted using [deduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning) from that which is known *[a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori)*. Like [foundational mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics) (which is sometimes considered a special case of metaphysics applied to the existence of number), it tries to give a coherent account of the structure of the world, capable of explaining our everyday and scientific perception of the world, and being free from contradictions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyz6tqcxg7762qdega7f3nj))
	- [metaphysical realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism), the objects studied by metaphysics exist independently of any observer so that the subject is the most fundamental of all sciences ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyz75517h10dcbpx115qre9))
	- [Metaphysical anti-realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-realism#Metaphysical_anti-realism), on the other hand, assumes that the objects studied by [[metaphysics]] exist inside the [[mind]] of an observer, so the subject becomes a form of [introspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection) and [conceptual analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_analysis). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyz7gdst6h5w61x4mz7n8c5))
	- *Ontology* is the branch of [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) that studies concepts such as [existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence), [being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being), [becoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becoming_(philosophy)), and [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality). It includes the questions of how entities are grouped into [basic categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_being) and which of these entities exist on the most fundamental level. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyz8gp1wdt296vc8haymwhp))
	- Ontologists often try to determine what the *categories* or *highest kinds* are and how they form a *system of categories* that provides an encompassing classification of all entities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyz91kg13zre6e1dsh632zt))
	- [Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy)) is a fundamental metaphysical concern. Metaphysicians investigating identity are tasked with the question of what, exactly, it means for something to be identical to itself, or – more controversially – to something else. Issues of identity arise in the context of [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time): what does it mean for something to be itself across two moments in time? How do we account for this? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyz9qy89p9mmzwm04cb4b60))
	- Objects appear to us in space and time, while abstract entities such as classes, properties, and relations do not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyza6ex81gpvnkf1jkdszcs))
	- [Causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality) is linked by many philosophers to the concept of [counterfactuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactuals). To say that A caused B means that if A had not happened then B would not have happened. This view was advanced by [David Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher)) in his 1973 paper "Causation".[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics#cite_note-24) His subsequent papers[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics#cite_note-25) further develop his theory of causation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyzaj1spmpgbqnkepyxj5fp))
	- [Substance dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dualism) is a classical theory in which mind and body are essentially different, with the mind having some of the attributes traditionally assigned to the [soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_(spirit)), and which creates an immediate conceptual puzzle about how the two interact. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyzbt6ppq912sy3e5v85kry))
	- Adherents of [panpsychism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism), a kind of [property dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism), hold that everything *has* a mental aspect, but not that everything exists *in* a mind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyzc80zg86httjq1zyxkrmn))
	- Determinism is the [philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) [proposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition) that every event, including human cognition, decision and action, is [causally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality) determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences. It holds that nothing happens that has not already been determined. The principal consequence of the deterministic claim is that it poses a challenge to the existence of free will. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyzbezsq9benf677jds3wnz))
	- The earliest type of classification of social construction traces back to [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato) in his dialogue [Phaedrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedrus_(dialogue)) where he claims that the biological classification system seems to carve nature at the joints. In contrast, later philosophers such as [Michel Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault) and [Jorge Luis Borges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges) have challenged the capacity of natural and social classification ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyzdct6x3r0zv5f7n3qef6q))
	- Metaphysics continues asking "why" where science leaves off. For example, any theory of fundamental physics is based on some set of [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom), which may postulate the existence of entities such as atoms, particles, forces, charges, mass, or fields. Stating such postulates is considered to be the "end" of a science theory. Metaphysics takes these postulates and explores what they mean as human concepts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyzg9cqad4yx950v0dzqwn8))
	- In physics, new metaphysical ideas have arisen in connection with [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_quantum_mechanics), where subatomic particles arguably do not have the same sort of individuality as the particulars with which philosophy has traditionally been concerned. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyzfjwm3rymecmrgkz69jk9))
	- [Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon) rejected [scholastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism) metaphysics, and argued strongly for what is now called [empiricism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism), being seen later as the father of modern empirical science ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyzh0jc9ec2n0w676fpzqbw))

	- pre-historic [[art]] and customs suggests that a form of [perennial philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_philosophy) or [Shamanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanic) [[metaphysics]] may stretch back to the birth of [behavioral modernity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_modernity), all around the world. Similar beliefs are found in present-day "stone age" cultures such as Australian [aboriginals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians). Perennial [[philosophy]] postulates the existence of a [[spirit]] or concept world alongside the day-to-day world, and interactions between these worlds during [[dreaming]] and [[ritual]], or on special days or at special places. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz18pjpvr6v95fnx1f2ym9b))
	- [[Heraclitus]] of [Ephesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus), in contrast, made change central, teaching that "all things flow". His [[philosophy]], expressed in brief aphorisms, is quite cryptic. For instance, he also taught the [unity of opposites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_of_opposites). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz19jb8tc77qtanyc9q80bq))
	- The fourth century BCE saw a turn towards [cosmogony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony) with the rise of [Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism) (in the [Daodejing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daodejing) and [Zhuangzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book))) and sees the natural world as dynamic and constantly changing processes which spontaneously arise from a single immanent metaphysical source or principle ([Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao)).

	- [Neo-Confucians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Confucianism) like [Zhang Zai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Zai) under the influence of other schools developed the concepts of "principle" ([li](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_(Neo-Confucianism))) and vital energy (*[qi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi)*). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz1b5snn4r82d60vdhjt035))
	- [Potentiality and actuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiality_and_Actuality)[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics#cite_note-69) are principles of a [dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomy) which [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) used throughout his philosophical works to analyze [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)), [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes) and other issues. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz1bxpkpnkn02sab427bbvb))
	- *Sāṃkhya* is an ancient system of Indian philosophy based on a dualism involving the ultimate principles of consciousness and matter.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics#cite_note-72) It is described as the [rationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism) school of [Indian philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_philosophy).[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics#cite_note-73) It is most related to the [Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_(philosophy)) school of [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism), and its method was most influential on the development of [Early Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-sectarian_Buddhism).[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics#cite_note-royper-74) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz1ckjdtjphwjwxh7rh8wk7))
	- Guṇa, it states, are of three types: *sattva* being good, compassionate, illuminating, positive, and constructive; *rajas* is one of activity, chaotic, passion, impulsive, potentially good or bad; and *tamas* being the quality of darkness, ignorance, destructive, lethargic, negative. Everything, all life forms and human beings, state Samkhya scholars, have these three guṇas, but in different proportions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz1djzj79dzj4a5z3c9c9xc))
	- Self-consciousness means self-knowledge, the knowledge of Prajna i.e. of Prana which is attained by a Brahman. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz1eavrjb5r3pkkh16pfaf8))

	- The skeptic [David Hume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume) famously declared that most metaphysics should be consigned to the flames (see below). Hume was notorious among his contemporaries as one of the first philosophers to openly doubt religion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz1hpf1192f89htwqpz2zz1))

	- Kant saw rationalist philosophers as aiming for a kind of metaphysical knowledge he defined as the *[synthetic apriori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical-synthetic_distinction)*—that is knowledge that does not come from the senses (it is [a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori)) but is nonetheless about reality (synthetic). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz1kvm2m79ed30m2vgyyfe1))
	- There *is* a reality beyond sensory data or phenomena, which he calls the realm of [noumena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noumena); however, we cannot know it as it is in itself, but only as it appears to us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz1mw3agaqs44zqw1hwxhm0))
	- Nineteenth century philosophy was overwhelmingly influenced by Kant and his successors. [Schopenhauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schopenhauer), [Schelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling), [Fichte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichte) and [Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegel) all purveyed their own panoramic versions of [German Idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Idealism) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz1nj43tcw5wb1vw4xphpjn))
	- [Analytic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy) was spearheaded by [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell) and [G. E. Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._E._Moore). Russell and [William James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James) tried to compromise between idealism and materialism with the theory of [neutral monism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_monism). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmz1nxw47q0wvryq52255mxj))
	- [Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidegger), author of *[Being and Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_and_Time)*, saw himself as re-focusing on Being-qua-being, introducing the novel concept of *[Dasein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasein)* in the process. Classing himself an [existentialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialist), [Sartre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sartre) wrote an extensive study of *[Being and Nothingness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_and_Nothingness)*.
