	- I know it is hard to express briefly such a difficult topic, but I would really like to get different answers to the question: 
	  WHAT IS A ZETTELKASTEN?
	  I am interested in any #roamans (and not ((not yetðŸ‘€))) opinion.

	- Next weekend I hope to pull together lots of thoughts I have been dishing out in my graph. I have lots of #I and #Obs, which @brandontoner would probably call [[Fleeting Ideas]] and [[Fleeting Observations]]
	  
	  One of these asks what Zettelkasten means for different people. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/iamPeterRosso/status/1394321729196019714))
	- @maggied answered this question on her Saturday Afternoon Musings (please call them SAM ðŸ˜…)

	- When is content more important than connections?

	- An important point of discussion has been the presence of emotions. Feelings and memories have been used a lot for memorisation which is a valid point for immersive fleeting notes. But it goes beyond it since we are interacting with a conversation partner.

	- @JoelChan86 Synthesis is not an alternative for Zettelkasten, but an additional process to preventively have a conversation which I rather not repeat multiple times. I often read â‰  papers with the plan of using observation/evidence to compile a note.

	- In my system, [[Permanent Notes]] are the result of an offroad journey where I could stir and change direction guided by my feelings. What resonates guides my writing, and I don't need to take someone back on my journey but only through the most salient points.

	- [[Synthesis Notes]] are like being on a train. I know that I need to get from A-B at the present time, and I know that other people will need to go through my exact same journey to verify the rigour of my thinking. These notes can still surprise with unexpected connections ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/iamPeterRosso/status/1394329578223644674))
	- [[Essential Properties]] for a Zettelkasten - @JoelChan86 for the synthesis. 
	  Despite all of the changes that people have made to the system these seem the most important properties.
