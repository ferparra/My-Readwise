	- Ethereum is a security & data availability chain, and only one of those is remotely comparable. The other three are execution focused monolithic chains and will soon be technologically obsolete in the face of StarkNet and zkSync 2.0. Few understand the modular revolution. https://t.co/Ncw4XuPxwb ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1441455170928349185))
	- With zkRs, account abstraction & smart wallets, the concept of "transaction fees" and "TPS" will be deemed irrelevant long term. Indeed, you can see this on dYdX, Immutable X, Sorare etc. *TODAY* - the concept of gas fees does not exist - they have literally $0.00 gas fees.

	- @danrobinson No consensus layer since we don't care about decentralization. Proof-of-authority sequencers with the most efficient VM shards, all VM shards resolving internally to a common state (note: much easier wo consensus sharding), which is compressed and dumped on a sharded storage DB.

	- @ArthurB @danrobinson Some additional info: with DDR5, you can have 8 TB of 7,200 MT/s RAM with ~50 million IOPS on a single server in 2022. State expiry when it's saturated, dump expired state on an "expiry archive" DB. It'll be trivial to revive expired state objects to active state when required.

	- Rollups have superior composability properties than monolithic blockchains. In future, you can have a giga zk rollup with millions of TPS maintain composability over 1,000 data shards (or indeed ext. DA layers) without being crippled by inefficient proof-of-stake reprocessing. https://t.co/hpDaPO6757 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1458734407192170498))
