document_note:: The Stoics believed that following a few core principles could lead to a happy and fulfilling life. These principles are divided into four "cardinal virtues": Wisdom, Courage, Justice, and Self-discipline. Personal values are important because they help to define one's identity, guide what is deemed most desirable and praiseworthy, and help to live one's best life. To define one's personal values, one can reflect on what qualities they find admirable in others and think beyond the core four Stoic virtues. It takes courage and self-discipline to live consistently with one's values, and regular meditation and reflection can help to live more in line with them.

	- *Modelling Questions*
	  
	  These modelling questions aim to identify traits in other people that you value.
	  
	  1.  Think about the people you admire – in general terms. What qualities do you admire about them?
	  2.  Think of three specific people (real or fictional) that you admire. What qualities make them admirable?
	  3.  Try to imagine someone perfectly wise and good. What virtues does this person possess?
	  
	  When you know specific traits you value, you’re better able to develop these traits within yourself and become more like the people you admire. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt56gcgytkp0jzjz1ft6ygz5))
