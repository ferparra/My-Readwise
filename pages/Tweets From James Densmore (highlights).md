	- Credit to engineers on my team for teaching me about @getdbt tags. A slick use case is tagging models based on desired run schedule. For example, tag models as "hourly" or "daily" and Airflow can execute just that subset
	  
	  dbt run --model tag:daily
	  dbt run --model tag:hourly ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jamesdensmore/status/1401983694789828610))
