	- A simple explanation for why ‚Äúestimations‚Äù and timeline-based ‚Äúroadmaps‚Äù don‚Äôt work, is that product development isn‚Äôt a scheduling problem but an explore/exploit problem. 
	  
	  Time isn‚Äôt the constraint, but knowledge.
	  
	  Knowledge that isn‚Äôt currently ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù to the market. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/astralwave/status/1249136929825849347))
	- Product development is closer to stock trading & epidemiology than manufacturing or traditional pure software dev.
	  
	  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What confused me when first starting out in product management is learning techniques rooted in manufacturing or software dev, then struggling w them in practice ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/astralwave/status/1249136931222573057))
	- Took a long time to realize I should be reading Taleb, Hayek, Judea Pearl, Donella Meadows, Ray Dalio, etc.
	  
	  Instead of what is usually recommended reading for product managers like Toyota Way, or Marty Cagan. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/astralwave/status/1249136932422062080))

	- I should also clarify (since a lot of people have pointed out that explore/exploit also includes an element of time) that this does not mean product development does not employ scheduling methods. Quite the contrary. You schedule efforts to negotiate the explore/exploit trade off ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/astralwave/status/1250879435768651776))
	- You can ‚Äúsplit the difference‚Äù by opting to do equal parts exploring and exploiting, treating them as categorically different types of work. This is the ‚Äúdual track‚Äù method. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/astralwave/status/1250879440080580610))
	- Or you can make incremental bets into various areas of exploration, where exploring and exploiting lies along a continuum, and you‚Äôre maintaining a portfolio of bets at any one point in time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/astralwave/status/1250879442357977094))
	- In practice this often looks like a scheduling problem: you‚Äôre dealing with the finite resource of time and the mechanics of flow. But this is where the similarities end. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/astralwave/status/1250879444472008707))

	- A follow up train of thought: graphs as a way to represent opportunities, and graph traversal as a means to explore / exploit: https://t.co/VudixlSQiq https://t.co/xJ0AZvcdUa ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/astralwave/status/1293105393070231552))
