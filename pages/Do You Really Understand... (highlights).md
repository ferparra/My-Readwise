	- Do you really understand what business you're in and how your business works?
	  
	  Chances are you don't.
	  
	  You understand parts of it, but businesses can be complex, w/ many moving parts and competing priorities.
	  
	  My suggestion: MAP your business, w/ your team. Here's how: ðŸ§µ

	- First, here's what a map looks like. It includes:
	  
	  * Every touchpoint with your users/customers
	  * It includes all the user states & actions 
	  * It includes parts of your business that you may not have built out yet
	  
	  OK, how do you map your specific business? See 7 steps below: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/byosko/status/1643963323149426691))
	- 1. Get the right supplies
	  
	  Try this in-person with your team. Get a big white board, pens, sticky notes, etc.
	  
	  I can almost 100% guarantee as you do this it will lead to lots of interesting conversations and make you realize there isn't always alignment. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/byosko/status/1643963326085357570))
	- 2. Start at the beginning
	  
	  It's easiest to start w/ customer acquisition. Regardless of your startup's stage, you're trying to acquire users/customers. Most likely you have a website & a few acquisition channels. Map all of that out. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/byosko/status/1643963328090308610))
	- 3. Website conversion
	  
	  Without going into tons of detail map out the high level conversion steps/triggers on the site. How are you trying to move people from visitor to signup / activation? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/byosko/status/1643963329897963522))
	- 4. Now work your way through the customer experience
	  
	  What happens next? Again, you may put too much detail (that's OK!) Try and abstract the details and map out the major components of the business. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/byosko/status/1643963331802218498))
	- 5. Capture as many steps & user states as possible
	  
	  User state = visitor -> signed up -> active -> etc.
	  
	  These user states are critical to driving your business model. So map them out + the steps it takes to get to them (and the steps that happen after.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/byosko/status/1643963333547110402))
	- 6. Go back & define the metrics between steps & user states
	  
	  Now that you've got the model in place try and determine the key metric(s) to track at each step; think of the metrics as what happens between steps and user states. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/byosko/status/1643963335241617408))
	- 7. Identify the "hot spots"
	  
	  Now you have a map with steps, user states & metrics. Where do you need to focus? It's either:
	  
	  (a) Where things are breaking down
	  (b) The next part of the journey (which should become obvious and is fairly logical) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/byosko/status/1643963337099603971))
	- Trust me, if you map your business it's going to help.
	  
	  * More clarity
	  * More alignment
	  * Better employee engagement
	  * More focus (on what matters!)
	  * Better strategic overview
