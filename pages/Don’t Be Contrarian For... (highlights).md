	- Don’t be contrarian for the sake of being contrarian.
	  
	  But recognise that much truth in reality (say in science or economics) is counter intuitive. So tending in the direction of contrarianism can sometimes help.

	- Much of Jocko’s best content is hidden in his “Underground” podcast (subscriber only).
	  
	  He’s a nice example of: when stakes are high one needs an epistemology that actually works: which is why he’s a thorough-going fallibilist. Of course he might not call himself that. But he is. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ToKTeacher/status/1625624737861992451))
	- Fallibilism: there’s objective truth - there’s an actual fact of the matter - AND it’s always possible to be wrong about it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ToKTeacher/status/1625624740768657408))
	- But it’s not only “high stakes”
	  where epistemology matters (doomsayers & existential risk types say their stakes are high) but rather - high stakes and *readily, repeatedly tested in reality*. Like on a battlefield in war as Jocko knows. It’s not always “in the abstract future”. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ToKTeacher/status/1625627137133903872))
