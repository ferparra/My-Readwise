	- Lactate is an important fuel source
	- Zone 2 training—physiologic characteristics, fuel sources, lactate, and the transition into zone 3
	- Using blood lactate levels (and zone-2 threshold) to assess mitochondrial function
	- Accessing mitochondrial function by looking at one’s ability to utilize fat as fuel (with an RQ test)
	- Athletes vs. metabolically ill patients—mitochondria, fat oxidation, muscle glycogen capacity, “fat droplets”, and more
	- Physiologic characteristics of zone 3, zone 4, and the lactate threshold
	- Fueling exercise—dietary implications on glycolytic function
	- Relationship between exercise and insulin sensitivity (and what we can learn from studying patients with type 1 diabetes)
	- Metformin’s impact on mitochondrial function, lactate production, and how this affects the benefits of exercise
