document_note:: The biographies of exceptional people all have a common theme: the adults in their lives had high expectations of them and created a rich intellectual environment for them to grow in. They allowed the children to explore their own interests and learn through self-directed activities such as reading books, attending lectures, and participating in conversations with adults. They also had access to exceptional tutors who would guide them in their intellectual pursuits. This type of intellectual apprenticeship was important in helping them grow into exceptional people. While they all had innate talent, the education they received was also essential in their development.
