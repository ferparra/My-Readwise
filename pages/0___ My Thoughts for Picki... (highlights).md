	- 0/ My thoughts for picking at seed & pre-seed. Mental models & thought experiments:
	  
	  (I rarely post stuff like this ‚Äî but put some thought into these recently and would love feedback üòá) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rsg/status/1186775048297697281))

	- 1/ Be thesis-agnostic
	  
	  
	  By the time a narrow thesis is formulated, it‚Äôs generally too late for seed investors. No fund had a crypto thesis when I invested in Coinbase in 2013. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rsg/status/1186775148990386176))
	- 2/ Find communities who see the future
	  
	  Coinbase was ‚Äòobvious‚Äô to those in the Bitcoin community in 2012 (forums, Reddit). What obvious futures are waiting in other communities? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rsg/status/1186775307539234817))
	- 3/ Swing for the fences
	  
	  The Power Law governs venture returns ‚Äî my returns over last 7 years showed me this firsthand. I ask whether an opportunity might be capped or un-capped and swing for the un-capped outcomes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rsg/status/1186775672741478400))
	- 4/ Catch big waves early
	  
	  Startups often move in waves with enabling technologies & platforms. Waves are hard to predict. Smart folks call them wrong a lot more than they get it right.
	  
	  I have my guesses‚Äîbut prefer founders guide me to new ways of thinking. Catch it‚Äîdon't call it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rsg/status/1186776753135448064))
	- 5/ Ask: What if they‚Äôre right?
	  
	  The best returning investments often sound crazy at first. It‚Äôs critical to charitably imagine what the world looks like if the founder‚Äôs vision turns out to be correct. A simple, almost dumb exercise‚Äîbut important to do before shooting ideas down. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rsg/status/1186777053774798848))
	- 6/ Intuit the founder's map
	  
	  Gain an understanding of the ‚Äúidea maze‚Äù a founder has mapped out in their head. How high-resolution is their picture of the maze? Can you test it?
	  
	  Do they have a specific path charted through the maze? How will they course-correct for wrong turns? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rsg/status/1186779421996306432))
