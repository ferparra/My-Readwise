	- A research repository is just that – one central place, or source of truth, where people in your organization can go to find the latest insights from your research team.
	- A research repository should be approachable not only for user researchers, but also for other members of the product team like designers, product managers, developers, and stakeholders like founders or executives.
	- Someone should be able to look back on a user research insight from years ago, review the evidence, and determine if it’s still relevant or has been interpreted correctly based on what is now known. Researchers should be able to look back to see if new insights could be developed from research data that was collected previously.
