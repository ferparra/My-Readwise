	- A little over two years ago I was approached about an exciting and interesting opportunity to help setup a Kaggle competition for predicting stability of RNA molecules.

	- It seemed like a daunting task, but I was just a part of a larger, experienced team consisting of Kaggle staff and members of Rhiju Das lab at Stanford. All of their subject matter knowledge, experience, and insights made the competition a resounding success,

	- which was a starting point for the ensuing research work that culminated in this paper. 
	  
	  The solutions that the Kaggle community came up were absolutely astonishing.

	- Those solutions, in turn, would have been impossible to come by and with very little impact without the contribution of another great crowdsourcing platform - Eterna Game. All these great contributors are part of the authors list of this paper.

	- RNA technology has already had an  impact on various therapeutics. I believe that this is only the starting point, and that many even more significant breakthroughs lay ahead. It is my hope that the work that we presented in this paper will be a part of revolution.
