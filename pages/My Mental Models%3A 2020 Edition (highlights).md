	- People think in very different styles, related to how they use their senses while thinking.  For example, some people see images during a conversation for each concept, others ‘feel’ concepts in their body, others have explicit models that they update, and many have some combination. Also, some people can’t imagine in images, and others can't store faces. It’s very strange that we enter adult life without a shared understanding of this.
	- If you’ve read something, it definitely doesn’t mean you understand it. Empirically, I’ve never understood important things on the first, second or third read. And normally, I’ve had to come back to the same thing years later. I’m not sure if this is true for everyone.
	- From a friend: you can never spend too much time improving your fundamentals. Work done there feels ‘slow’, but it makes everything else a quick step away. Also from this friend: use mental pictures/images/compressed representations of a concept, and refine those ‘toys’, to learn the thing.
