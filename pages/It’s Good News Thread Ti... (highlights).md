	- It‚Äôs Good News Thread time
	  
	  The Thread where we wrap up the positive COVID news that no one dares talk about
	  
	  A truly delightful üßµthis week ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lux_schwab/status/1443316474219798533))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- The USA‚Äôs quiet recovery continues ‚Äì infections are dropping almost everywhere
	  
	  Across the country, new daily COVID cases have dropped by 35 percent (in the last two weeks)
	  
	  Not sure what‚Äôs going on in Alaska, but fortunately only 731,000 people live there

	- The unvaccinated American South has been the most impressive performer
	  
	  Florida infections are down by 70%
	  
	  Remember those warnings of Florida hospitals being overwhelmed (like two weeks ago)? Covid patients now take up only 24.9% of Florida beds (this % is falling 1% per day)

	- Daily hospital admissions continue to trend down in the UK ‚Äì dropping 25 percent in the last month
	  
	  Lower admissions = lower deaths
	  
	  Hospitalisations in UK are back to the level before all restrictions were eased (and remain 85% below the January peak despite all schools back)

	- India take a bow
	  
	  The world‚Äôs second most populous nation has vanquished the dreaded Delta strain
	  
	  Covid deaths are almost at the lowest level since the pandemic began last March
	  
	  Each day, 27,000 people die in India (but only 283 of them have Covid)

	- The magnificent Scandinavians continue to show the world how it‚Äôs done
	  
	  Norway, which has removed ALL restrictions is recording less cases than Melbourne - where you can‚Äôt leave your house after 9pm (in case you're wondering, Norway and Melbourne have about the same population)

	- Denmark (population: 5.8 million), with zero restrictions is now recording about a third of the number of infections as Melbourne and Sydney
	  
	  Fun fact: They don‚Äôt shoot protestors there 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAedbknWQAc5-rE.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lux_schwab/status/1443316498806751237))
	- Denmark have vaccinated about 75% of all people and Norway only 67% of people
	  
	  NSW will hit Norway‚Äôs vaccination rate in around two weeks (but many restrictions in NSW will continue until December, while lighter rules will persist in NSW until well into 2022)

	- In July, Chile was apparently a salient lesson why vaccines, especially Chinese vaccines, don‚Äôt work
	  
	  Suddenly, no one is talking about Chile anymore
	  
	  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not because Chile‚Äôs death rate has fallen 92 percent, despite most restrictions lifted in August
	  
	  Chick chick boom

	- Last month, the media wouldn‚Äôt shut up about the unfolding ‚Äòdisaster‚Äô in Israel
	  
	  Israel never locked down, imposed almost no restrictions and allowed gatherings of hundreds of people ‚Äì since then, infections have dropped by 55%
	  
	  (Note: NSW 1st dose of 72% is above Israel‚Äôs 67%)

	- Australia has gone from vaccination laughing stock to superstar
	  
	  Thanks to vaccine FOMO and a Gladys masterclass, within a month NSW will be one of the top 5 most vaccinated regions in the world
	  
	  And Victoria is about two weeks behind

	- While Singapore‚Äôs transition to 'Covid Normal' may seem bumpy, don't forget, 98% of infections in Singapore are asymptomatic or mild 
	  
	  While Singapore‚Äôs daily infection level has hit 2,000, its Case Fatality Rate remains below 0.10% - roughly the same level as influenza

	- The maligned Oxford-AZ vaccine continues to be one of the most miraculous breakthroughs ever
	  
	  While AZ lacks Pfizer‚Äôs PR skills, its cheaper vaccine outperforms Pfizer in every real life data set
	  
	  Dame Sarah will likely end up saving more lives than anyone this century

	- By the way, this was what Norman Swan, who last practiced as a doctor in 1979, said about the miracle Astra Zeneca vaccine
	  
	  (Almost all of the 379 people who have died in Australia since June actively chose not to take the AZ vaccine)
	  
	  Aged like a corked Spumante this one

	- Remember Long Covid? 
	  
	  Oxford Professor John Bell said last week that long Covid was ‚Äúoverblown‚Äù and ‚Äúmuch much lower than people anticipated‚Äù
	  
	  The UK‚Äôs ONS suggested half the people who thought they had long Covid didn‚Äôt have it
	  
	  RIP Long Covid. You were great while you lasted ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lux_schwab/status/1443316528334655489))
	- One last one to add to the ‚ÄòVaccines Are Pretty Cool‚Äô file
	  
	  Yale (of Ivy league fame) has vaccinated 99% of undergrads and 92% of staff
	  
	  This week, Yale recorded a positivity rate of only 0.02%
	  
	  That‚Äôs only one in 5,000 people infected
	  
	  (Thanks to @sailorrooscout for this one) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lux_schwab/status/1443316529886531587))
