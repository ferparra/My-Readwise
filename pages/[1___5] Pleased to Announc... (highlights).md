	- [2/5] How do we design batch interventions for learning causal models in a nonlinear setting, which also scales easily with the number of variables? We address this problem with the use of the Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design framework by considering perfect interventions üî®.

	- [3/5] In a perfect do(¬∑) intervention, any intervention target is set to a particular value. We show that we can design good experiments by selecting **not only** the intervention targets but also the optimal value to set when doing this intervention.

	- [4/5] Our method uses Bayesian Optimization to select the optimal values. Then, we extend this to choose a batch of interventions, which leads to faster recovery of the true causal models than random and other recently proposed approaches, like AIT.

	- [5/5] Read more about our work https://t.co/iN8T5PO8tX and have fun playing with our code https://t.co/Sfryhnx6gk. Also, come to chat with us at #NeurIPS2022 if you are working at the intersection of causality and experimental design. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ptigas/status/1592883613510828034))
