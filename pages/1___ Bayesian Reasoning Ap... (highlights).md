	- 1/ Bayesian reasoning applied to crypto - A Thread
	  
	  There are various theories that have been devised to try and understand crypto's future. These include the halving cycle, the stock-to-flow model, and various wave theories among other things. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/C1aranMurray/status/1394345797802762245))

	- 2/ The reality is that there is little data to support any of these theses. They’re either beset by confounding factors (eg S2F) or involve tiny samples (eg halving theory). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/C1aranMurray/status/1394345941562441730))
	- 3/ There is only really one robust prior probability in crypto and it is this: Over ~12 years or ~4500 days the value of the cryptocurrency market has gone up.
	  
	  Yes it is volatile and there have been substantial drawdowns but on average crypto goes up (a lot). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/C1aranMurray/status/1394346018158911496))
	- 4/ So the oft joke about “numba go up” is literally the best predictive tool we have for this market. That’s your Bayesian prior probability or base rate. And it’s a pretty damn robust one. 
	  
	  What does that mean for investment/trading decisions? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/C1aranMurray/status/1394346124232650754))
	- 5/ The (blatantly) obvious conclusion is that you need to have a *very* good reason not to be long. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/C1aranMurray/status/1394346271465517058))
	- 6/ Very good reasons would be things like big problems in other large markets (eg subprime crisis) as correlations with other risk assets average on the high side, runaway inflation or severe regulatory risk for crypto - something equivalent to a ban.

	- 7/ That’s how big the reasons would have to be for me. The market breaking below key trend lines from previous bull markets, etc don’t cut it for me as the n for those indicators is simply far too small for it to budge the numba go up prior probability significantly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/C1aranMurray/status/1394346619315888130))
	- 8/ The only other strong prior probability in crypto AFAICS is that it’s very volatile. Given that, it is rational to be less long after periods of growth but then you introduce huge uncertainty with timing and human emotion (FOMO when you’re not long, etc), ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/C1aranMurray/status/1394347034065387522))
	- 9/ So for that reason, IMO, the Bayesian play is to just HODL for numba go up unless faced with unprecedented long-term market risk.
	  
	  Everything else is just too uncertain. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/C1aranMurray/status/1394413474428637192))
