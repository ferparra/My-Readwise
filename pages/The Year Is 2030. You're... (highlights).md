	- The year is 2030. You're a software engineer at a company, writing tests for your program. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1365433319572185092))
	- After you write a few tests, your IDE is like, "hey, I noticed you were testing this; do you want this more general thing to hold?" and spits back a specification for you. You're not sure. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1365433479559745537))
	- You say, "give me some examples," and your IDE generates more tests for you. One of them looks off, so you tell your IDE, "no, not that one." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1365433776982007810))
	- Your IDE sends you another specification. This one looks better, so you approve it. Your IDE tells you to hang out for a bit while it tries to see if it actually holds. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1365434074110697472))
	- After ten seconds or so, it generates a failing test. You fix your code and try again. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1365434265500934144))
	- This time it's like, "I couldn't find any counterexamples, but I'm also not positive it's true. Can you help me prove it?" You say yes, of course. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1365434511597527040))
	- It asks you a couple of specific questions about your code. Thinks for a bit, and then tells you that your code is verified. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1365434891106586625))
	- In fact if you are an advanced user you can go check out the proof yourself. No need to, though. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1365435065422016519))
	- A couple of days later, you change your code. Your IDE notices this and tries to check the specification again. It tells you that it is no longer true; but based on the change you made, there is an analogous change in the specification, so maybe you want this new specification?

	- You're not sure so you ask for some tests. It looks good. And this time the tool doesn't need to ask you any questions to prove it; the proof is similar enough to the proof of the old specification, so you're good. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1365436305509740546))
	- After a few more weeks of this, your IDE notices something else, though. You keep changing that function, and changing your specification to go with it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1365436837934731267))

	- So it recommends a new abstraction for you that would have captured all of the past examples. It tells you, hey, if you use this, things might break less often to begin with ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1365436987746918400))
	- It looks good so you're like, "oh cool, yeah let's do that." And it drops into a guided refactoring mode, helping you through the change, asking you just a few questions but automating all of the tedium. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1365437245910519808))
	- Does this for your program, then for your proof. And your proof doesn't break again for months after that. Good shit. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1365437385366937600))
	- Think this sounds cool? Work with me üòÄ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1365437464022683648))
