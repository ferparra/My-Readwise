	- I studied 600+ eCommerce brands representing $4.4B in rev to find whatâ€™s powering the most successful outcomes.  
	  
	  The results were surprising.  Here's what I learned:
	  
	  #1 - ROAS is Overrated

		- **Note**: Thread
	- Expectation:  The most successful brands (fastest growing + profitable) would be powered by higher ROAS.  
	  
	  Reality:  There was no meaningful correlation between ROAS and growth and/or profitability. ðŸ¤¯ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/youderian/status/1549458917339578369))
	- What DID matter?
	  
	  Successful stores were 600% more likely to cite "Branding & Storytelling" as their comp. advantage and 77% more likely to make their own products.  
	  
	  The strongest predictor of profitability was lean, efficient operations - NOT advertising performance. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/youderian/status/1549458918799196161))
	- Highly profitable companies were 25% less reliant on paid traffic, had 50% fewer employees and were more likely to outsource fulfillment.
	  
	  Takeaway?  
	  
	  A strong brand, high-margin model and lean ops. are  more important than ROAS. Act accordingly & get lean like @MehtabKarta! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/youderian/status/1549458920258805760))
	- #2 - We've Hit Peak Amazon
	  
	  For the first time ever we saw a drop in the # of stores selling on AMZ.
	  
	  Only 53% of stores sold on the platform vs. 55.8% a few years ago. A subtle drop, but the first one ever.
	  
	  Just as surprising was how non-AMZ brands are performing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/youderian/status/1549458921831768068))
	- Brands that didn't sell on AMZ grew rev 32% faster and profits 50% faster, smoking their Amazon-selling counterparts.
	  
	  AMZ isn't going anywhere: 2/3s of stores will keep selling on it despite it getting harder.
	  
	  But I predict this trend of brands gradually leaving to continue. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/youderian/status/1549458923446571009))
	- #3 - You Need to Raise Your Prices.  Again.
	  
	  Brands aren't keeping up with supplier prices hikes and it's eating away at their profits.
	  
	  Suppliers raised prices by 15% on avg. last year while brands increased pricing to customers only 11%. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/youderian/status/1549458924977491976))
	- This contributed to declining profitability as net margins dropped from 18.2% to 16.1%.  
	  
	  Solution?  Get over your fear, make the @federalreserve's job harder and raise prices, again if needed!
	  
	  The vast majority (85%) of brands reported a positive outcome after raising prices. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/youderian/status/1549458926541873156))
	- This is just a few of the surprising things we found in the data.
