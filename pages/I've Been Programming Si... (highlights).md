	- I've been programming since 1983. Based on the last month or so using chatGPT here are my thoughts on what it changes for both me personally  and for software companies and teams....company CEOs and CFOs should be aware of what's coming....families too ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640406862314061835))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1. Code quality is going to improve immediately. This will reduce cost of development and cost of maintenance. Project time lines and TCO are going to shrink. Mostly for new software but also for legacy stacks ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640406880664141825))
	- 2. Individual programmers are now going to be "more portable" across tech stacks. A 50 year old Java programmer (like me) is almost fully productive overnight in a Javascript environment. And vice versa. This reduces skillset granularity and therefore cost. More with less. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640406895788802064))
	- 3. Programmers can outsource most new atomic code dev to GPT. Effectively every senior dev now has an infinite number of good programmers to which she can delegate to. This means that senior programmers just became way more valuable and less experienced programmers less so. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640407465375219726))
	- 4. Less experienced programmers are going to be much easier to mature. The "becoming a mediocre programmer" timeline just shrunk massively. But... These guys won't be able to re-engineer existing code or designs. They will knock out apps/sites for a fee and and do very well. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640407603221020694))
	- 5. Non tech Startups can delay a lot of cost to get an MVP together. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640410979229126656))
	- 6. Companies producing/promoting APIs need to make sure GPT knows how to get to them and has the reference material in its training scope. A new marketing channel or "SEO for tech companies". Harder than it sounds. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640410984056516609))
	- 7. CEO/CTO should be asking what the training plan is for their devs on this technology. This should not be an optional thing and should form an active component of people strategy.
	  
	  I can't think of any reason all programmers should not be trained on how to use this. Now. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640410992256462849))
	- 8. System Architects are still going to be necessary to design systems that are scalable but all the plumbing and config/scripting  of things will become much easier or disappear. Take note sys admin and devops people - you are becoming more productive but less of you needed. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640411002524016640))
	- 9. The inhouse "SQL guru" is gone. with the right plug in, every bit of this role is gone. Expose your dbmodel to GPT and its going to do a great job at querying your data efficiently no matter how complex the ask. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640411009830772737))
	- 10. Same for analytics and dashboards. If used properly GPT is going to build all the reports and all the dash boards. Ancient interfaces like Tableau are toast. Even the Ui will be built on the fly by GPT ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640411032777621506))
	- 11. Complex algos like GIS manipulation / video and image editing as well as animation and sexy interfaces are all now within the reach of a mainstream programmer (like me). This for me is the most fun part. Producing sexier looking interfaces just became the default. Eg. https://t.co/92YZGMpvH6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640421060695736338))
	- 12. Education... This is an awesome opportunitu to bring kids into the wonderful world of programming. Secondary/high schools could now be producing 18 year olds ready for productive work...I think that's a great thing. 3rd level isn't for everyone ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640421067302002688))
	- 13. If embraced in early education, this wil improve the female to male ratio for programmers. CHATGPT feels Darwinian in that regard. Institutions should subsidize access to this tech for the early stages. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640421156443308032))
	- 14. Time to onboard new programmers in gigantic legacy code bases will also shrink. The days of taking 6 months to get a programmer familiar with a legacy code base are gone. GPT will navigate them thru the intricacies and interdependencies of spaghetti stacks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640421160268582912))
	- 15. Per 14...commenting code is now probably optional. Why bother? The LLM can do that in real-time.
	  
	  "what's this code doing chatgpt and can you clean it up for me?"
	  
	  "if I change this, what else might break?" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640421164651560990))
	- Done! (for now) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realBobbyHealy/status/1640421558379266052))
