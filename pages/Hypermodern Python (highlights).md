	- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is a tool to manage Python packaging and dependencies.

For alternatives to Poetry, have a look at [flit](https://github.com/takluyver/flit), [pipenv](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/), [pyflow](https://github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow), and [dephell](https://dephell.org/).
