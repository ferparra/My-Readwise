	- Went to the gym, lifted weights and then had a 40g protein shake, afterwards had a total energy crash -fatigue - I couldn’t do anything more cognitively challenging than TikTok for a few hours. Y’all think it was the weights or the shake or like, dehydration? Or coincidence ? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ladymcscope/status/1612007770555060224))
