document_note:: This document is a dialogue between Chris (a Stoic) and Tim, in which Chris explains Stoic values and how they relate to happiness. The Stoic view is that virtues such as wisdom, self-control, justice and courage are necessary for true happiness and that having these virtues leads to the enjoyment of "preferable indifferents" such as health, wealth, and friends. Chris also explains that virtue is not something imposed by social pressure or conditioning, and that it brings with it real enjoyment and peace of mind. In the end, Tim seems to have a better understanding of the Stoic view of happiness and virtue, and is encouraged to consider how these virtues can be important in his life.

	- Tim: So what would you say about the existence of people we could all think of who seem to be happy in a conventional sense – they have wealth, lots of pleasure – but don’t seem to exercise much virtue?  
	  Chris: But if their happiness depends on those things (wealth, pleasure) it is unreliable – what if they lose them and have no personal strength (no virtues, in other words) to deal with this loss? Whereas developing the virtues is under our control and so Stoic happiness is not fragile.  
	  Tim: OK, I can agree that without the virtues happiness is more fragile. But what about the opposite? People who do exercise virtue well but suffer great misfortune? Why should I want to be virtuous and on the rack rather than having a nice evening out with my friend?  
	  Chris: Nobody chooses to be on the rack of torture (though you might choose to act with integrity rather than cowardice and so end up on the rack). People don’t usually choose to be refugees or starving or politically oppressed – but most of the population of the world find themselves in this situation and even those of us in affluent, democratic, countries experience bereavement, illness, and other forms of loss. The hard question is: can we achieve happiness under these circumstances and what does it depend on? And the Stoic answer is it depends (solely) on whether you do or do not have virtue.

		- **Note**: Tim asked Chris about people who seem to be happy, but don't exercise much virtue. Chris said that if their happiness depends on things like wealth or pleasure, then it is not reliable because those things can be taken away. Chris said that if we develop the virtues, our happiness won't be fragile. Tim agreed that without the virtues, happiness is more fragile. Then Tim asked why he should want to be virtuous if it can lead to bad things like being on the rack of torture. Chris said nobody chooses to be on the rack, but bad things do happen to people. The hard question is if we can still be happy in bad situations, and the Stoic answer is that it depends on whether or not we have virtue.
