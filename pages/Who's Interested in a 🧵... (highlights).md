	- Who's interested in a üßµ about tech interviews? 
	  
	  In the last ~2 years I've interviewed at Riot, AWS, Spotify and Citadel, and got offers from all except AWS. I promise that's not to brag, just to say I'm not pulling this stuff out of my üçë ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370874399390367756))
	- Everything below is for folks who want to upgrade their careers, and nothing more. I'm not interested in telling anyone what to learn, what to do with their time, etc.
	  
	  This is just from what I've seen at the interviews I mentioned above. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370874907454803974))
	- The #1 tech skill to have is comfort in coding, on the fly, in front of other people. Expect to be given some silly use case, ie, "write a class that take two strings, and tracks which is longer"
	  
	  Be comfortable talking through the requirements, asking questions, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370875384812740610))
	- Expect to iterate on it, over and over, with requirements being added. Ie, "now optionally take an array of strings, and, if an array was passed, track the shortest string. If just two strings were passed, like before, then ..." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370875805681774598))
	- Most important tip I can give: **think out loud**. Always. Turn the voice in your head you normally think with, off, and think out loud.
	  
	  If you get stuck, talk it through, out loud. Explain why you're stuck. Ask questions. Your interviewer is there to help you. Seriously. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370876015145259008))
	- The worst thing you can do is stop coding, and freeze up, panicking in your mind.
	  
	  Talk it through. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370876163619426306))
	- Expect to be asked questions in your domain to test how deeply you know it. I was asked about everything from arrow functions, to Promises, to web sockets.
	  
	  The deeper you know your stuff, and can demonstrate it, the better. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370876548815982593))
	- If you're asked about arrow functions, don't just say they're shorter syntax sugar.
	  
	  Mention lexical this.
	  Mention lexical arguments.
	  Mention lack of a Prototype and [[Construct]] slot.
	  
	  Show them you're someone who knows their shit. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370876952639373314))
	- If you're asked about FlexBox (yes, I was asked about Flex) don't just say it's a nice layout mechanism in CSS
	  
	  Mention the main axis, and justify-x properties
	  Mention the cross axis, and align-x properties
	  Mention that the direction of the main axis reverses with rtl languages ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370877705462419460))
	- You know what I was never, ever asked about, even once?
	  
	  JS Frameworks
	  
	  Oh, you've written apps in React, Svelte, Vue and also Angular? Nobody gives a shit.
	  
	  Companies care a lot more that you have deep language mastery, vs having played with a bunch of different frameworks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370878275245989899))
	- You know what else I was never asked about?
	  
	  CSS Frameworks.
	  
	  Tailwind seems really, really cool. But maybe learn the fundamentals of CSS before you dive in, there. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370878538723778563))
	- One thing that surprised me: TypeScript was stressed a *lot* more than I was expecting. Getting some of the typings exactly right was one thing I had a few hiccups on, here and there (that's why I've been reading every TS book I can find, lately). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370879010381643777))
	- So if you dislike TypeScript, and have been avoiding it, sorry, bad news. You need to learn it. Your interviewer probably won't be interested in whatever reasons you might have for disliking / hating it.
	  
	  Just know it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370879339219316746))
	- So how about the other half of tech interviews: the dreaded "tell me about a time when" questions.
	  
	  Scour your career, and think of every interesting / hard / fun thing you've done, to talk about. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370880714233815047))
	- Questions will be things like, 
	  
	  "Tell me about a time when you"
	  
	  had a difficult task / time constraint / etc
	  had to convince management of something
	  had to deal with interpersonal conflict 
	  etc
	  
	  Be articulate. Show growth in how you handled it. Discuss lessons learned. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370881166048395265))
	- Don't underestimate these questions, especially if you interview at AWS. These fucking things will be in ALL FOUR of your interviews, and you'll be repeating the SAME stories to multiple different people üòñ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370881755134197764))
	- And they're looking for really, really specific shit, and be extra careful in how you answer them. I mean they're the one company who rejected me so I'm not sure what the secret sauce there is. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370882252683538432))
	- I was told I did well in the tech questions, and got to the solutions they wanted, but didn't "demonstrate product ownership at the scale Amazon was looking for"
	  
	  I was a startup tech lead for years, growing a small requireJS / jQuery web app to a beast of a modern React app. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370882749742120961))
	- I owned a League Client plugin well enough that I was made project lead this past Jan to upgrade it from web components to Ember
	  
	  But I guess I answered those questions poorly?
	  
	  Anyway if you're interviewing at AWS hit up some forums for advice I guess? I dunno‚Äîbut good luck! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370883254472093697))
	- To end on a positive note, and I swear to god this is true, however self-serving it might seem:
	  
	  Spotify was the best interview experience, by far. Very well organized, clear questions, great interviewers. Ideal experience. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370884979241148425))
	- The only reason I didn't leave that interview on cloud nine, confident of an offer was because of how fucked up I let the AWS rejection get me ü§° ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1370885180358062082))
