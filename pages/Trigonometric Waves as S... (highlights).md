	- Trigonometric waves as shadows of meta-phenomena in Plato's cave. A rotating spiral when projected in orthogonal dimensions yields distinct phenomena in different dimensions.

	- Phase, frequency, and amplitude co-exist as cross dimensional epiphenomena: https://t.co/XZfVbikPC3 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/prathyvsh/status/1164160890129678338))
	- These insights could have saved me years of toil mugging up equations in high school and college where I thought algebra and trigonometry to be abstract bullshit. If only I knew signs held insight. What I missed was Maths was modelling life itself. It is a mirror of our universe. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/prathyvsh/status/1164160892142886912))
	- One more video elucidating a helix as a concurrent composition of sine wave and cosine wave: https://t.co/5EHyDLd3J8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/prathyvsh/status/1185502531687858177))
	- Mamikon Mnatsakanian has deviced a method for solving Calculus visually without any equations! https://t.co/fDD7dorukG
	  
	  Here's a book he cowrote with Apostol: https://t.co/hgTRZDY2Q6
	  
	  And an article by Apostol describing the approach: https://t.co/J9bsFyYbGm

	- A circle turning on its time axis becomes a sine wave when viewed from front and cosine wave from top. One turn of the circle is one period of these waves. This is denoted as sin(2π×ω×t + φ). ω is the number of turns per second, t is time, and φ, initial position of the arrow. https://t.co/6pZbMZA3tR ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/prathyvsh/status/1189285237102202880))
	- If you want to imagine a real life phenomena that follows this helical trajectory, a good model is our solar system. Motion of the planets and the sun draw these sine and cosine waves in spacetime.

	- For these sort of intuitions on Mathematics, @LucasVB is a pioneer in the field. He recently did a reflection on his visualizations used throughout Wikipedia: https://t.co/OysX7dswQa ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/prathyvsh/status/1246213914813067264))
	- @LucasVB One of my all time favourites from his oeuvre is his visualization of Fourier Transform: https://t.co/Mimn54OtY3 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/prathyvsh/status/1246392570286157825))
	- The idea that vector fields are gradients of manifolds is a powerful idea.

	- TIL about Prosthaphaeresis, an algorithm used in 16th and 17th century to approximate multiplication and division using trigonometric ratios! https://t.co/pv2C9Vz8Ky

	- TIL that there is something called non-commutative torus in the theory of C*-algebras: https://t.co/8r08VnoCts
	  
	  Funny looking shape which is much reminiscent of Escher’s ouroboros torus.

	- This is actually a pretty nice visualization that tells how the hypercube rotation can be understood by relating it to a stereographic projection of a 3D cube.

	- This locus of sine and cosine looks like a super ellipse getting twirled around. Anyone know what this curve is called? Only slowly warming up to this, but locus of curves are fascinating!
