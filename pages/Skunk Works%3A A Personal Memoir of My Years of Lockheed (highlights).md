document_note:: The Skunk Works is a special project of the aerospace company Lockheed Martin, founded by legendary engineer Kelly Johnson. Ben Rich, Johnson's successor, recounts the unique way the Skunk Works operated and the 14 mantras the company followed in order to make the most efficient aircrafts and ships. These mantras included using a small team, delegating responsibility, pushing inspection back to subcontractors, and rewarding good performance with pay. Rich also highlights the secrecy and inefficiency of the Skunk Works, which led to the successful development of the stealth fighter, the SR-71 Blackbird, and other advanced aircrafts. Working with suppliers and forming long-term relationships was also an important part of the Skunk Works operations.

	- **One of Kelly‘s key mantras was to have everybody as close to the production floor as possible - even a stones throw away was too far as he wanted structural changes and questions to be addressed immediately. Any delays were to be reported to Kelly immediately and stock items were to be used in place of special parts, even at the expense of added weight - the potential for delay was too great if too many special parts were used**

He emphasized that any delays should be reported immediately and that stock items should be used in place of special parts, even if it meant increased weight, in order to avoid delays.
