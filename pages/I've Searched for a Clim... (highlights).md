	- I've searched for a climate change "silver bullet" for more than a decade: A globally scalable, tech-enabled solution.
	  
	  I've finally found it: A way to remove all the carbon from the sky for no net cost.
	  
	  I'm starting a company to do it. Let me take you down the rabbit hole:

	- Humans have a rich history of amending our soil with carbon.
	  
	  Over 2,500 years ago, Amazonian tribes buried charcoal with food scraps. It transformed marginal soil into incredibly rich, fertile soil.
	  
	  The carbon they buried (as charcoal) is still there today. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/XavierHelgesen/status/1578854045422620672))
	- Today, we have an almost incomprehensible amount of carbon in our sky.
	  
	  1 TRILLION tons of CO2 in the atmosphere need to go somewhere. (all living things weigh 0.4% of this)
	  
	  We only have expensive, inefficient ways to pull it out, and no clear idea where we would put it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/XavierHelgesen/status/1578854048404738049))
	- Luckily for us, there is one thing that literally eats CO2: plants. 
	  
	  The core reaction of photosynthesis transforms CO2 + sunlight into glucose and oxygen. 
	  
	  It naturally splits the oxygen from the carbon in CO2 and captures the carbon in physical form.

	- Carbon dioxide is only 0.04% of the atmosphere. Yet the carbon content of a tree is around 50% carbon. 
	  
	  Carbon is only 27% of the weight of a CO2 molecule. So the pure carbon in a tree represents almost 2x the weight of the tree itself in terms of CO2 sequestered. (50% * 1/.27) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/XavierHelgesen/status/1578854058672410624))
	- Carbon is not only captured by trees. Agriculture captures an enormous amount of carbon. 
	  
	  Rice husks are 34% carbon. 
	  
	  Wheat husks are 39% carbon. 
	  
	  Coconut Shells are 50% carbon. 
	  
	  Agriculture is carbon neutral today - but what if it could be massively carbon negative? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/XavierHelgesen/status/1578854060840857600))
	- It can be, but here's where we need technology. 
	  
	  We need to capture the carbon in a form that is economically useful and will stay in the ground. 
	  
	  We also need to utilize the green energy embodied in tree and plant agricultural waste. 
	  
	  That's the technology I am building. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/XavierHelgesen/status/1578854062975393792))
	- This is a containerized modular bioreactor. 
	  
	  It uses pyrolysis to convert wood waste into biochar and biogas. 
	  
	  Biochar is incredibly useful and valuable, most particularly as a way to add carbon back to soil. 
	  
	  Biogas can generate green heat, electricity and even hydrogen.

	- To make a dent in the carbon balance of the planet, these reactors must:
	  
	  Be manufacturable at automotive scale.
	  Be decentralized globally.
	  Produce economically useful commodities as outputs.
	  Leverage waste feedstocks as inputs.
	  Generate the bulk of their own energy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/XavierHelgesen/status/1578854074920755200))
	- This machine is designed to manufactured using the same tools and materials as the automotive industry. 
	  
	  By making it modular, we can take it to wherever biomass waste accumulates. 
	  
	  By leveraging mass production, we can make it far more affordable than large custom plants. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/XavierHelgesen/status/1578854078922489856))
	- At scale, we can use this biochar to repair the soil depleted by industrial agriculture around the world and even make desert regions fertile. 
	  
	  One acre of soil can store more than 10 tons of biochar, giving us the one carbon sink large enough to actually solve global warming. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/XavierHelgesen/status/1578854081518399489))
	- At scale, these bioreactors remove carbon as a happy byproduct of a profitable industrial process. 
	  
	  The revenue streams of waste removal, green energy and carbon products (biochar, activated carbon, etc) make the math work even if there is no carbon credit revenue. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/XavierHelgesen/status/1578854085595652098))
	- I want to recognize that all I have shared here is built on the shoulders of giants in the world of engineering, regenerative agriculture and biochar. 
	  
	  I am working to bring it from a niche into a mainstream part of our economy by bringing talent and capital to it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/XavierHelgesen/status/1578854088770744320))

	- If you think this is cool, please DM me for the full white paper. 
	  
	  We need lots of help - especially capital and talent.
