	- The author does a good job of pointing out what may be the strongest skills of LLMs but the claim they aren't useful as a search engine didn't ring particularly true. For many questions I have ChatGPT is the best tool to use because I know the topics I'm asking about are mentioned hundreds of times in the web, and the LLM can distill down at knowledge to the specifics I'm asking about. If you treat it as a friend who has a ton of esoteric knowledge in many areas but is prone to making stuff up to sound like they know what they're talking about you can still get lots of use pulling facts and some basic reasoning out of the models.

	  He can make the same criticism of Internet searches as he does of GPT: you shouldn't trust them until you validate them.
	  
	  I find that GPT's answers are for the most part more reliable the searches, specifically today's searches. In the last 12 months, search results have become so spammy with AI generated pages (oh the irony), that it's hard to find reliable answers.
	  
	  So like search, I look at GPT's answers with a grain of salt and validate them, but these days I use GPT all day every day and search rarely. To be fair, I use it a lot because I have a GPT CLI that works just the way I want it to, since I wrote it :-).
