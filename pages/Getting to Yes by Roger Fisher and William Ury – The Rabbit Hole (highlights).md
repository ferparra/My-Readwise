	- Principled negotiation is neither hard not soft and should separate the people from the problem (attack problem not them), focus on interests not positions, invent multiple options for mutual gains, and insist on using objective criteria
	- Don’t deduce a persons intentions based on your fears
	- Don’t blame other side for your problems even if justified as it is unproductive
	- Look for opportunities to act in opposition to people’s preconceived perceptions
	- Focus on interests, not positions. There are usually several different positions to satisfy all interests
	- 4 major obstacles in negotiation:
	  
	  Premature judgment
	  Searching for a single answer
	  Assumption of a fixed pie
	  Thinking that solving your problem is solving their problem
	- Withhold judgment and try to see the other persons point of view
	- If other sides BATNA is too good, see what you can do to change it
	- Ask other side how much authority they have and if they have final say in the decision
	- The more concrete the offer, the more powerful (written more powerful than oral)
