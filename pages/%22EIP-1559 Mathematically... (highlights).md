	- "EIP-1559 mathematically guarantees that $ETH  will hit $15,590. That is my high level understanding"
	  
	  h/t @ricburton 
	  
	  With ETH breaking all time highs this week, understanding it has become an imperative
	  
	  WTF is EIP-1559 mean for the average non technical user?

	- **Some context:**
	  
	  Currently 90%+ of web3(NFT's, DAPP's etc) is all on the ETH ecosystem. 
	  
	  With more real world applications spawning everyday, transaction fees(also called gas fees) are becoming increasingly important ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/srinathariharan/status/1392161304031334402))
	- Currently the ETH ecosystem uses a simple auction system to determine transaction fees
	  
	  Miners choose to process transactions with the highest bids
	  
	  You pay more for a priority transaction
	  
	  This system has quite a few problems and EIP-1559 solves all of them

	- Problem: the current system is slow
	  
	  Currently there is a cap on the size of blocks that carry out transactions in the network - 12.5 million (also called gas limit). 
	  
	  This means that it takes multiple blocks to approve some transactions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/srinathariharan/status/1392161588828721153))
	- How EIP-1559 solves it: 
	  
	  EIP-1559 means the blocks on the network dynamically change size based on the number of pending transactions in the network. 
	  
	  The maximum size(gas limit) of a block will be doubled from 12.5 mill to 25 million. 
	  
	  TLDR: EIP-1559 means faster transactions ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/srinathariharan/status/1392161763412484096))
	- Problem: Ridiculous fees
	  
	  The problem with any auction system is that its impossible to determine a base reference point of what the cost of a transaction is. 
	  
	  Currently it takes complex algorithms to estimate this
	  
	  Still most people end up overpaying ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/srinathariharan/status/1392161870736289798))
	- How EIP-1559 solves it:
	  
	  EIP-1559 introduces a base fee and an inclusion fee. The base fee is burned but the inclusion fee goes to the miners. 
	  
	  Some estimates say that fees could go down by as much as 70% 
	  
	  TLDR: EIP-1559 means less fees ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/srinathariharan/status/1392161976399192067))
	- Unintended consequences: 
	  
	  Burning base fees mean that eth becomes a deflationary currency.
	  
	  the issuance rate of Ethereum stands at 4.5% per year
	  
	  Post EIP-1559 the estimated issuance rate be 0.5 - 1%. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/srinathariharan/status/1392162022985326594))
	- Many people in the ETH community like @ricburton and @garrytan have started using the bat and loudspeaker emoji to signify this ultrasound effect. 
	  
	  As base fees get burned and demand outstrips supply, ETH becomes truly ultrasound money https://t.co/m0aSE9WVv8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/srinathariharan/status/1392162245749006345))
	- Miners take the fall:
	  
	  Reduced fees means that mining becomes significantly less profitable. It does however make miner's income flow more predictable ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/srinathariharan/status/1392162342285189120))
