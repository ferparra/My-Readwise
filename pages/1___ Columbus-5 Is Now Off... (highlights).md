	- 2/ Col-5 unlocks numerous dimensions for the Terra ecosystem to better capture value, port assets across IBC-enabled chains, and set the foundation for a vibrant TeFi economy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1443533410996080645))
	- 3/ Economic Changes: 
	  
	  Columbus-5 simplifies the Treasury Module logic of the Terra protocol so that 100% of the $LUNA seigniorage generated by the expansion of the $UST supply is burned. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1443533412124426242))
	- 4/ By closely tethering LUNA demand to UST demand, LUNA value capture becomes a function of USTâ€™s adoption in a thriving cross-chain, Internet-native environment. As a result, more demand for UST shifts LUNAâ€™s demand curve outward, while LUNAâ€™s supply curve contracts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1443533413240033283))
	- 5/ Community Pool & Ozone: 
	  
	  Since 100% of LUNA is burned in Columbus-5, no more seigniorage will be diverted to the community pool. Currently, the community pool contains roughly 98.675 million LUNA, equating to approximately $3.5 billion. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1443533414473232387))
	- 6/ $1 billion from the community pool will be burned via the on-chain swap (LUNA â†’ UST) to bootstrap Ozone. Ozone is an algorithmic, claims-based insurance protocol approaching launch on Terra. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1443533415626670083))
	- 7/ Ozone is currently undergoing an audit and is expected to launch in mid-late October. 
	  
	  Obviously, the LUNA price and amount in the community pool have changed significantly since the original proposal. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1443533416729772039))
	- 8/ Plans for Ozone and the community pool will be clarified soon as Ozone finalizes its audit and prepares for launch. Please stay tuned for further updates. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1443533417853849603))
	- 9/ IBC: 
	  
	  IBC is a standardized communication protocol for blockchains that are IBC-compatible. The Cosmos SDK comes with IBC natively, which is disabled by default in Stargate (the latest major SDK upgrade) and needs to be manually initiated. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1443533419133091841))
	- 10/ As a result, IBC functionality on Terra will go live following an on-chain governance vote now that Columbus-5 is live and stable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1443533420336799745))
	- 11/ Once the network is ready to unleash the gates of interoperability for UST and other Terra assets, a governance vote to manually initiate IBC on Terra will be published. 
	  
	  More updates about the plans for the IBC governance proposal will be released soon. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1443533421393821697))
	- 12/ Columbus-5 is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication by a thriving community of developers, users, partners, investors, and #LUNAtics of all varieties. Itâ€™s a momentous step for the network and our community. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1443533422505250820))
	- 13/ Columbus-5 is just the beginning. 
	  
	  It lays the foundation for future waves of apps, protocols, builders, and users to onboard into the TeFi ecosystem -- wielding the power of decentralized money that is more attractive to spend and hold than fiat incumbents. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1443533423608426501))
	- 14/ From the May crash to today, itâ€™s been one helluva ride. 
	  
	  Welcome to the beginning of the future of Terra, courtesy of Columbus-5.
