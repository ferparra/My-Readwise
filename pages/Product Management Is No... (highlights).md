	- [[Product management]] is not about:
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Obsessing over velocity, deadlines, and roadmaps
	- It's about:
	- Marrying customer goals and business goals
	- Start with those questions:
	- How is it aligned with the company's vision?
	- How will it affect our customers and users?
	- Can our business support it (e.g., legal, finances)?
	- What are the other risks? How can we mitigate them?
	- Remember that product management is about creating a "product customers love, yet also works for our business" (Marty Cagan, Inspired). Not about pleasing stakeholders. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PawelHuryn/status/1609534486819086337))
