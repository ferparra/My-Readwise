document_note:: Radical acceptance is a state of unlimited freedom where we recognize what is true and embrace it with an open heart. We recognize and accept our negative thoughts and feelings so that we can work through and grow from them. Tara Brach provides guidance, meditations, and actionable steps to help us with these feelings of unworthiness. By doing this, we can learn to accept our body, looks, intelligence, etc. and not resist or reject them. We can also learn to be mindful of everything going on, feel both joy and pain without holding back and make big changes. Desiring is not a bad thing and we should not deny or suppress it. We can use mini and longer pauses throughout the day and year to check in with ourselves and be mindful of our breath and mindset. Our suffering comes from resisting and fighting our temptations and not the actual temptations. We should also not classify others and be open, honest, and authentic to create a space for others to do the same.
