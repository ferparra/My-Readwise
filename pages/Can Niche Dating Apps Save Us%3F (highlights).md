	- Field Can Be the Next Grinder
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Field is a successful dating app that caters to the LGBTQ community and is profitable., * Field is trying to expand its user base and is adding features that acknowledge the larger cultural shift towards ethical nonmonogamy., * The mainstream apps are catching up to Field, but Field is likely to continue to be successful in the future.)

	  It's something most independent dating apps never achieve. Field has also taken very little investment. So far, just half a million dollars. CEO Anna Korova hinted the company might take more soon as it continues to see growth and attracts more investor interest. So as far as profitability and future potential, Field appears to be in a good spot. It can be the next grinder, an app so successful that it's talked about in the same conversation as hinge or bumble. Grinder nailed all those same key indicators to get where it is today. Volume and density. Grinder has millions of active users. It's global and it's growing, so check. Next indicator. User and intent. Grinder is so crystal clear on who its user is. LGBTQ and primarily gay men and its intent to chat and hook up. So understanding user and intent. Big check. And lastly, profitability and the potential for continued growth. Grinder is profitable. It's now publicly traded and more people are identifying as LGBTQ than ever before, which means more potential grinder users. So once again, check. That growth though also benefits field, which caters to queer communities. Another demographic that's on the rise is ethical non-monogamy. Field CEO Anna Korova sees these changes as part of a larger shift.

	  I think the future of dating will start looking less and less like an end game. When you say dating, it feels like something that should stop at some point.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  She says that more people are looking for a kind of dating that doesn't have to end in a monogamous partnership. And that's where fields can help. Is that enough to make it the next grinder? Maybe. But the mainstream apps are trying to catch up. Hinge for example recently added a feature that allows users to list themselves as ethically non-monogamous. That move acknowledges this cultural shift and may even say something about field success. Oftentimes these shifts that begin within queer culture will eventually make their way to the mainstream. Remember, grinder predates Tinder. At some point the mainstream does tend to catch on. And helping make alternative ways of dating go mainstream likely means more business for field in the future. When we return, we're going to talk to other founders about other niche dating apps.

	  And we'll examine which apps are bound for success and which are destined to fail. ([TimeÂ 0:14:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b678d4a9-02e2-4d37-afee-1d7c77de03b2))
