	- We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains.
	- self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves
	- Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time.
	- Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place
	- Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have.
	- The slip-box provides an external scaffold to think in and helps with those tasks our brains are not very good at, most of all objective storage of information.
	- always read with an eye towards possible connections in the slip-box
	- While we should seek out dis-confirming arguments and facts that challenge our way of thinking, we are naturally drawn to everything that makes us feel good, which is everything that confirms what we already believe we know.
	- More notes mean more possible connections, more ideas, more synergy between different projects and therefore a much higher degree of productivity.
	- Change is possible when the solution appears to be simple.
