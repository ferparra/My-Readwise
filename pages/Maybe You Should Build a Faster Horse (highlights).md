	- Building features no one uses is the cardinal sin of product work, and building features merely because users are asking for them is a well-known way of committing it.
	- Building faster-horse features can be a reasonable product strategy if scale allows you to build key protective barriers for your business and if building these features is the way to achieve that scale.

	- Economies of scale, among other things, long protected Intel from competition from AMD. High switching costs protect SAP from competition even though their product is almost universally disliked.

	- Economies of scale, network effects, and switching costs only matter after you’ve acquired a lot of customers. In some cases, if you don’t have the features people are asking for, they’ll choose to use your competitor’s offering instead, even if those features don’t wind up solving their problem optimally.

	- If building faster-horse features allows your business to achieve scale, you can offer your product for cheaper (economies of scale) and in some cases, you can make your product more valuable (network effects). These things clearly benefit the user, and in many cases, they’re going to be more beneficial than the feature you could have built if you didn’t “waste time” building a faster-horse feature like a potato button.
