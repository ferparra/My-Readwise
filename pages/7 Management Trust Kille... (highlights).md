	- Follow-through Fail: overpromising/underdelivering
	  
	  "You're on track for a promo!" (but it doesn't happen)
	  "Let's talk your career goals next time" but the next chat is about some immediate task
	  
	  Antidote: Apologize and rework a plan as soon as you know expectations won't be met. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joulee/status/1415328586991423491))
	- Talk but No Walk: do as I say, not as I do
	  
	  Chewing a report out for being late, while being frequently late
	  Saying "I trust you", but then micromanaging your work
	  
	  Antidote: never demand more from others than you expect from yourself. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joulee/status/1415328587801010176))
	- Flip-flopper: their desires change as often as socks
	  
	  Pushing for "quality" one week, and "speed" the next week.
	  Asking for 'blue-sky ideas' but then rejecting any that might fail
	  
	  Antidote: publicly set goals / priorities every X period.  Don't change until the period is over. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joulee/status/1415328588648222723))
	- Gossipmonger: they confide something negative about someone to build bonds.
	  
	  "X is so stubborn. I don't know how you can stand being in the same room as them."
	  
	  Antidote: imagine everything you say will be repeated to others. Say only about X what you have said to X directly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joulee/status/1415328589424119808))
	- Ostrich Head: only wants to discuss the good; never the bad.
	  
	  Telling you why something isn't a problem when you bring it up.
	  Pretending a crisis is not happening when it is.
	  
	  Antidote: acknowledge issues. It's okay to say "I don't know the answer, let's figure it out together." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joulee/status/1415328590439194626))
	- Ruinous Empathizer: doesn't say things they think you might not want to hear
	  
	  Giving you wishy-washy, compliment-sandwich feedback about why you weren't promoted
	  Struggling to fire underperformers on the team
	  
	  Antidote: read Radical Candor by @kimballscott ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joulee/status/1415328591294832646))
	- Us vs. Them: puts their own team above other teams
	  
	  Advocating for a report's promotion when it doesn't calibrate well against peers
	  Ignoring another team's asks for help
	  
	  Antidote: internalize company > team. Your team may love you, but you'll get dagger stares + stalled career. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joulee/status/1415328592209145860))
