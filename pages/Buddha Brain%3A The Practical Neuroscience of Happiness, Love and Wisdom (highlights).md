document_note:: Rick Hanson's book, Buddha Brain, explains how ancient Buddhist practices and scientific data can be used to strengthen our brains in order to increase happiness, love, and wisdom. Thoughts literally shape our brain, so we should be mindful of what we think and how we react to situations. We should be aware that pleasure and rewards are fleeting, and that we should aim for a mind with no preferences and free from reactions. Additionally, we should be conscious of not attributing intentions to others, and cultivate mindfulness, self-compassion, and empathy. Finally, we should be aware of our self and not identify with it.

		- **Note**: Implicit memory is made over time through things we do and it's like our regular way of thinking. It can be good or bad, so it's important to remember and focus on the good things that happen to us and forget about the bad things. Whenever something good happens, it's important to focus on it, think about it, and try to remember it. It can be anything from a smile to the smell of an orange.
