	- Tao is the natural order of the universe. It’s the guiding energy that lives within us and connects us to everything around us ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/cf198aec-7378-4027-806e-1d55aca9429d))
	- A master is powerful because they don’t seek power. By not searching for more power, they are able to use the strength that the universe has given them effectively. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/a6899876-eaa9-45cd-bdad-e0429a2520cf))
	- A master never leaves anything incomplete because they never do anything without the universe’s prompting. In being selective with their actions in this way, they never take on more than they can accomplish. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/4c912438-7041-4fc1-a48b-33caea768cd5))
	- you must embrace all people and things, disregarding any sense of personal perspective and removing the concepts of “good” and “evil” from your mind. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/562dcefd-f996-4ecc-8f0b-07b54b2c9904))
	- Instead of attributing qualities to the world around you, embrace things as they take their natural course. Don’t linger on the past or the future.

	- If you assume that you have enough knowledge to solve problems, you can’t remain receptive to the world around you. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/08808949-ecfc-4f6a-a4b6-374aed7387a9))
	- Priests and gurus may offer guidance, but their guidance is derived from their own knowledge and understanding of the world, not the objective reality that only the Tao can reveal to you. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/a0ba9357-81ad-44b7-a973-5ec7b87324ee))
	- To create usable emptiness in your life, embrace non-action (also known as wu wei, or 无为), or the willingness to remove personal desire and act only when the time is right. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/bceb968c-bdff-41a5-9460-8593a2f2a292))
	- Instead of trying to make the world bend to your desires, let go of the concept of “success” and remain internally focused. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/2e5088f4-3adc-4c2e-81b6-9ab75c1daee8))
	- Understanding others gives you knowledge, but understanding yourself gives you wisdom. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/ee90d3dd-cc97-4acb-bb53-327d786e1269))

	- if a loved one passes away, you may feel extreme sorrow. In that moment, allow yourself to grieve. However, once the emotion begins to fade, don’t allow yourself to hold on to it. Let it go and re-engage with the workings of the Tao. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/e52a857a-750b-4fa1-9857-7f06d68a37ea))
	- To achieve harmony, understand your place in the world and work to fulfill the function the universe requires of you—nothing more, nothing less. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/764fc911-018d-446b-aa69-1101961726a1))

	- leadership requires trust. Trust generates more honesty and respect amongst the people you lead. If you don’t trust your people, you create the potential for conflict as you tell your people that they aren’t trustworthy or respected. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/7727ea64-aff2-471f-9a50-a2c4c7fe2b70))
	- When issues arise, you must trust that your people will do the right thing ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/dc27d36f-24a1-4a20-8146-189a4ac61021))
	- the greatest leaders are able to generate large-group cooperation without ever having to say a word ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/c6aa8076-84eb-42ac-ab71-63ec07add900))
	- If you try to convince your people of the “goodness” of one side, you’re inherently placing your personal biases onto your actions and setting the stage for an opposing force to arise. Lead through observation and adaptability instead of ideals, and “evil” will disappear. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/0ed3204d-6652-4f6f-9af1-06705579b92c))
