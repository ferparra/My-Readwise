document_note:: "Mental liquidity" is the ability to quickly abandon previous beliefs when confronted with new information or changes in the world. This ability is rare because it is challenging to change our minds, as it is easier to continue believing falsehoods. Conviction is often mistaken for a good attribute, when it is actually a willful disregard for facts that may change our minds. Changing our minds is difficult because it is an admission that the certainty we once believed was an illusion. The strongest convictions have the highest chance of being wrong or incomplete, and it is important to be careful which beliefs become part of our identity.

	- **Most fields have lots of rules, theories, ideas, and hunches**. But laws – things that are unimpeachable and cannot ever change – are extremely rare. Some fields only have a handful. A big problem arises when you try to force rules and theories to become laws. The few laws tend to be the most important things in any field. But everything else, like Einstein said, is just a theory of maybes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq2he0vvrzd6td8eeh303sp))
