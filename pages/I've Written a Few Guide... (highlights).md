	- I've written a few guides on how to earn high interest on your stablecoins using #DeFi.
	  
	  By far, the easiest and most passive (but also high yield) way is @anchor_protocol, which currently pays out ~19.5% APY in UST.
	  
	  Let's see how that works. 🧶 🪡 👇

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ For reference, here's the step-by-step guide I had written about how to use @anchor_protocol to earn 19.5% APY on your stablecoins:

	- 2/ @anchor_protocol facilitates decentralized lending and borrowing.
	  
	  With this protocol:
	- 3/ There are 2 key things going on here:
	  
	  1. The loans are over-collateralized. (can only borrow < 60% of collateral value)
	  
	  So, if you have $100 of $LUNA as collateral, you will be able to borrow up to $60 of $UST stablecoin. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shivsakhuja/status/1474870084019519488))
	- 4/ 2. Collateral is staked for interest
	  
	  This is where most of the money is being generated.
	  
	  Let's run through the numbers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shivsakhuja/status/1474870085168754690))
	- 5/ Currently, @anchor_protocol has around:
	  
	  ~$ 4.8B in deposits (earning interest)
	  
	  ~$ 2B being borrowed (paying interest)
	  
	  ~$ 6.3B in collateral (staked) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shivsakhuja/status/1474870086238302210))
	- 6/ At 19.5% APY paid out to depositors, @anchor_protocol needs to earn 19.5% * 4.8B = $936M in a year.
	  
	  Now let's understand how @anchor_protocol earns that money.. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shivsakhuja/status/1474870087299448832))
	- 7/ Borrowers are paying 18.65% on the $2B.
	  
	  This generates 373M of revenue.
	  
	  The 6.3B in collateral (mostly $LUNA) is being staked to earn interest. On $LUNA, that is currently ~9%.
	  
	  This generates 567M of revenue. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shivsakhuja/status/1474870088343846912))
	- 8/ So @anchor_protocol will bring in 567+373 = 940M of revenue at these rates.
	  
	  But they only need to pay out $936M in interest to the lenders.
	  
	  The extra 4M is added to the Yield Reserve. 💰 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shivsakhuja/status/1474870089417560064))
	- 9/ Currently, the Yield Reserve has ~$73M, which is used to cover any temporary shortfalls in the borrowing + staking revenue.
	  
	  Now let's answer some questions you might have: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shivsakhuja/status/1474870090436792323))
	- 10/ What happens when borrowers collateral value falls? (Ex: if price of $LUNA falls)
	  
	  The Loan-to-Value or LTV ratio must be < 60%. 
	  
	  If the LTV goes above 60%, borrowers are liquidated. 🏴‍☠️
	  
	  I wrote about this here (and how to profit from this):
	  https://t.co/OkBgNGZFFy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shivsakhuja/status/1474870091535683584))
	- 11/ Why would someone borrow money if they have collateral? 🤔
	  
	  There are many reasons:
	- 12/ Why would someone pay such high interest rates on the borrowing?
	  
	  If you expect crypto to go up 2x,3x,5x, etc then paying 18% to borrow against it isn't crazy.
	  
	  Also... I lied about one thing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shivsakhuja/status/1474870093821579266))
	- 13/ @anchor_protocol incentivizes borrowing by issuing $ANC tokens to borrowers. 
	  
	  They issue 19.35% in $ANC tokens to anyone who borrows, meaning
	  meaning you are getting PAID 0.7% to borrow.
	  
	  Yes, seriously. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shivsakhuja/status/1474870094920511488))
	- 14/ This won't go on forever though..
	  
	  40% of the $ANC token supply will be used to provide borrower incentives over 4 years.
	  
	  Also important to note that the rates (borrowing, distribution, staking) fluctuate regularly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shivsakhuja/status/1474870096040325122))
	- 15/ Another important note: roughly 7% of collateral is actually in $ETH not $LUNA.
	  
	  $ETH has lower staking yield than LUNA (~5%). According to my math, Anchor is currently paying out slightly more than they are earning. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shivsakhuja/status/1474870097185361920))
	- 16/ They could increase the borrow rate or decrease the earn rate to make it sustainable if that continues. 
	  
	  A lot of this will fluctuate based on borrowing demand, market sentiment, token prices, etc.
	  
	  The numbers above are primarily to illustrate the general mechanism. 🛠 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shivsakhuja/status/1474870098238132225))
	- 17/ Hope this thread was useful to understand the mechanics of @anchor_protocol.
	  
	  Don't forget the risks when you use any #DeFi protocol! 💀
