	- 2/ Maker governance on L2 is represented by L2GovernanceRelay. This is a contract that will `delegatecall` desired L2 spell. It can be called only via a cross-chain message coming from L1GovernanceRelay. 
	  Finally, L1GovernanceRelay can be called only via an L1 spell. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/krzKaczor/status/1442563788792762375))
	- 3/ L2 Spells on both rollups were identical at this time and were meant to test the whole integration.

	- 4/ L1 spell is quite straightforward too. The biggest challenge is setting up values related to the L2 gas (especially on Arbitrum it gets difficult)... but this is a topic for another time.

	- 5/ To recap: contracts living on L2 can be fully managed by L1 governance via async messages. 
	  
	  No need for multisigs or any admin keys. Long live decentralization! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
