	- Okay, this is awesome!
	  
	  Instruction Tuning with GPT-4!
	  
	  This paper presents GPT-4-LLM, a "first attempt" to use GPT-4 to generate instruction-following data for LLM fine-tuning. 
	  
	  The dataset is released and includes 52K unique English and Chinese instruction-following data.…

	- One thing I appreciate from this paper right away is the focus on evaluation which previous similar efforts largely ignored. 
	  
	  The authors evaluate the ability of these self-instruct tuned models to follow instructions for arbitrary tasks. 
	  
	  3 different datasets are established.

	- These are the results from human evaluation with alignment criteria - basically testing the alignment quality of the instruction-tuned LLMs. Alignment is measured across helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness, following Anthropic Askell et al. (2021).
	  
	  Note the comparison with…

	- Here is where I mentioned that I was curious about the alignment bits of Vicuna. This GPT-4-LLM paper is a good starting point to begin testing these things more closely. Lots of implications here.

	- Good conclusion here. Nicely summarizes some of the more recent interesting efforts happening in parallel in the world of LLMs.
