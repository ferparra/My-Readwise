	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  You have a great quote in the introduction of the new book from sculptor Elizabeth King. And I'd love to hear you explain this or give examples of how it can apply or might apply. The quote from Elizabeth King is, process saves us from the poverty of our intentions. What does that mean? There would be no book if it weren't for that quote from Elizabeth King.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I don't know how it ended up on my desk. It came from somebody else who took credit for the quote, and I started tracking it down because it's so resonated with me. And after talking to him, he acknowledged, well, someone else really said it first. And I found this woman. And if you close your eyes and visualize the sculptor, you might be visualizing her. And if you think about how she lives her life and the number of hours she puts into each piece of work, it's extraordinary. And they made a documentary of some of her work, which you can see on Amazon. I had never heard of her, but now she's my friend. And I've just learned so much from that one sentence. What she is saying is this. Tomorrow morning, when you wake up, you probably won't feel like engaging in the practice. And if you do, you probably won't feel that way the next day, that what we do is once decide, we decide that we're a runner and runners go running every day. We decide we're a blogger and bloggers blog every day. And that decision lightens the cognitive load so much, because there's no time, no reason to negotiate with ourselves. Because we already had the meeting, we already decided. Now the question is not, should we go or not? The question is, should we go left or right? But we're going.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Are there other macro decisions like that in your life that you could give as examples of saving yourself from the poverty of intentions or from the whimsy of how you feel on different mornings?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, so the other one, which is as big as that one, is I think authenticity is a crock. And I think authenticity is overrated and talked about far too much. The problem with authenticity is it selfish. Authenticity enables us to say whatever we want. And if people don't like it, well, I was just being authentic. It is a ticket to self absorbed inconsistency. And I don't think anybody we serve wants that. I think what they want is consistency. I think they want us to make a promise and keep it. And the reason it's called work, not my hobby, is because I made a promise. And so I decided a really long time ago that I was going to be consistent. And it didn't matter if in a moment, I felt like yelling at a customer service person or going up on stage when I'm supposed to be adding energy and just taking energy instead. And what I learned from that is the way we act determines how we feel way more often than the way we feel determines how we act.
