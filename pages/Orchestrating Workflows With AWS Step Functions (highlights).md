document_note:: AWS Step Functions is a cloud-native workflow engine provided by AWS that allows users to define and execute workflows as state machines. States are the building blocks of a state machine, and can include choice, parallel, map, pass, wait, success, and fail. Action states are steps that perform work, such as invoking a Lambda function or starting an AWS Glue job. Input and output parameters can be manipulated using the "InputPath" and "Parameters" keys, and error handling can be managed using retries and catches. Executing a workflow can be done manually or automated, and can be monitored using the UI, CloudWatch logs, and the CLI or SDK. Finally, production lessons include understanding all workflow details, tracing full flows with a single ID, and using the parent step function.
