	- I engineered the Reddit iOS UI framework & now work at Apple.
	  
	  'A Philosophy of Software Design' by John Ousterhout is one of the most personally influential books on my design thinking.
	  
	  IMO, it's a better replacement of other introductory "must read" books.
	  
	  Here's a preview ðŸ§µ

	- John says, "the greatest limitation in writing software is our ability to understand the systems we are creating."
	  
	  There are 2 general approaches to fighting complexity:
	  1. Eliminate complexity by making code simpler and more obvious
	  2. Encapsulate it. Aka modular design.

	- Complexity is anything that makes it hard to understand & modify the system. It's always increasing.
	  
	  Complexity is caused by 1) dependencies & 2) obscurity.
	  
	  A strategic approach is continual investment in design. Tho at first slower, it will lead to greater overall progress.

	- Modular design manages complexity. 
	  
	  Modules is anything w an interface & implementation: class, service, function, etc. The interface is an abstraction that hides the implementation complexity.
	  
	  "Deep" modules are best. They provide powerful functionality via simple interfaces.

	- This is all the time I've to write on it. There's a ton more to this book: info hiding, layering, code duplication, errors, naming, comments, etc!
	  
	  I enjoyed it so much I emailed John & planned to meet in-person & interview him. But it never transpired bc of travel issues. ðŸ˜… ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Andi_Rohn/status/1442277055115108352))
	- Looking for an alternative to Uncle Bob's 'Clean Code'?
	  
	  I prefer Osterhout's book because it focuses on the core problem of design: managing complexity.
	  
	  He isn't overly prescriptive.
	  
	  The book is short, & one might say too abstract â€” there's little code. But that's a strength. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Andi_Rohn/status/1442307459964538881))
