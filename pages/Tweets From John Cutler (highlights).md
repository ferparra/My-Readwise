	- OK, this probably deserves some explanation:
	  
	  PjM:
	  Schedule? How much? On track? Budget? Requirements? Tasks? Change orders? T&M? Contracts? Delivery risk?
	  
	  PdM:
	  Options. Why? Why this? Who? How? Opportunity? Context? Benefits? Market/Competitors? Experiments. Value risk? https://t.co/9rZkiyzyKP ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/search?q=OK%2C%20this%20probably%20deserves%20some%20explanation%3A%20%20PjM%3A%20Schedule%3F%20How%20much%3F%20On%20track%3F%20Budget%3F%20Requirements%3F%20Tasks%3F%20Change%20orders%3F%20T%26M%3F%20Contracts%3F%20Delivery%20risk%3F%20%20PdM%3A%20Options.%20Why%3F%20Why%20this%3F%20Who%3F%20How%3F%20Opportunity%3F%20Context%3F%20Benefits%3F%20Market/Compe%20%28from%3A%40johncutlefish%29))
	- Product managers ... if the designers on your team are not surfacing deeper insights about your customers / users than you are capable of surfacing (eg if you aren‚Äôt learning)...
	  
	  then either 1) you aren‚Äôt listening or 2) you should advocate for more hiring more senior designers ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/search?q=Product%20managers%20...%20if%20the%20designers%20on%20your%20team%20are%20not%20surfacing%20deeper%20insights%20about%20your%20customers%20/%20users%20than%20you%20are%20capable%20of%20surfacing%20%28eg%20if%20you%20aren%E2%80%99t%20learning%29...%20%20then%20either%201%29%20you%20aren%E2%80%99t%20listening%20or%202%29%20you%20should%20advocat%20%28from%3A%40johncutlefish%29))

	- A big issue I have with the product owner certification industry is that it doesn‚Äôt set up individuals for career advancement outside of the narrow constraints of [[scrum]]. ‚ÄúPO‚Äù title in many cases gets a resume filtered out for product management roles. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1393671259351699457))
	- product is hard
	  
	  vanity metrics = easy
	  thoughtful measurement = hard
	  
	  individual projects = easy
	  collaboration = hard
	  
	  handoffs = easy
	  starting together = hard
	  
	  saying yes (or no) = easy
	  saying "no, but" = hard
	  
	  success theater = easy
	  embrace learning = hard
	  
	  hard, but worth it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1403082008096509953))
	- "inventory" can take so many shapes...
	  
	  * promises yet to be kept
	  * ideas waiting to be tried
	  * chronic issues brewing in the background
	  * small annoyances that make a tad harder
	  * plans brewing
	  * "work", backlogs, etc.
	  * "I'll look into that..."
	  
	  it takes up cognitive space ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1406812926690746379))
	- @natalia_mvp Long tail consumption of the content they add, edit, and maintain ... and long tail editing/sharing of that content. So if a create/edit X, and then people read/edit/share X, that turns me into a superstar? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1408585989325393921))
	- in a team of teams context (multiple teams working on the same product)...
	  
	  an empowered designer and tech lead ... and a team that doesn't mind "managing" its own process a bit ... doesn't necessarily need a product owner / product manager. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1349981772444942337))
	- So this is wild¬†(a textbook case of a couple things).
	  
	  Before the experiment they (large team of teams) were doing "traditional" qrtr planning. They were struggling with the mad rush at the end of the quarter.
	  
	  So they shifted to setting a rolling N day goal for throughput.

	- @lennysan #4 ... Dart Throwing
	  
	  Once you have an opportunity that feels worthwhile ... line up a lot of small-ish ideas that feel decent and throw darts
	  
	  do whatever the dart lands on ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1418753788727291908))
	- @lennysan #3 ....homegrown rubrics that capture the nuance and depth of the current strategy
	  
	  e.g. likelihood the ________ 
	  
	  with a preference for not weirdo math and weighting. 
	  
	  basically a checklist of "likelihood to _____" that trigger a discussion ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1418753465933647872))
	- Start clarifying those 1-3q bets.
	  
	  The best 1-3 quarter bets are:
	  
	  Descriptive not prescriptive
	  Compelling and Inspired
	  Outcome/impact oriented
	  Challenging (but in a good way)
	  Focused w/leeway for options
	  
	  Good luck!
	  (8/end) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1424832496961691648))
	- the rule of 3 options is so useful
	  
	  if you can't brainstorm at least three ways/options to achieve the [goal, objective, etc.] ... it is probably too prescriptive. 
	  
	  works as a test for OKRs as well ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1392507780985090052))
	- I'm going to keep persuading myself that simple and usable things often have a lot of thinking and messiness going on behind the scenes...
	  
	  yeah...

	- Context...
	  vs.
	  Time based...
	  
	  While useful for deploying strategy, OKRs are not strategy. They can do their job perfectly, and the company can still struggle.

	- Canvas we use at @Amplitude_HQ to elicit meaningful questions grounded in decisions, assumptions/hypotheses, progress areas, and models.
	  
	  Question asking takes practice, and you have to make space to diverge and converge.

	- a [[PRD]] - product #requirements document
	  
	  comes after:
	  * a #vision
	  * a #strategy
	  * A [[North Star Metric]] and Inputs
	  * detailed core beliefs/#assumptions
	  * open-ended #research
	  * bet [[1-pager]](s)
	  * persona-ish things
	  * detailed history of prior bets
	  * #learning #backlog
	  * (10 other things) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1449516223595626499))
	- a big problem in our industry
	  
	  you have simplified frameworks
	  
	  meanwhile, how actual successful teams work is messy
	  
	  companies adopt the simple frameworks and then apply their legacy process to the new way to fill in the gaps
	  
	  we don't talk enough about operationalizing things ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1450958039213690880))

	- hunch
	  
	  prioritizing backlogs/roadmaps is WAY LESS important that prioritizing strategic pillars, high-level inputs/value drivers, what not to do, NoKRs, etc ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1497721911660335104))
	- It is so hard, because what you actually need is:
	  
	  * smaller batches
	  * lower planning inventory
	  * shorter planning horizons
	  * more finishing, less starting
	  * more risk appetite
	  * more flexibility to navigate dependencies
	  
	  but that's not the go-to

	- Product work involves making decisions.
	  
	  Different types of decisions...

	- It is incredible the range of answers you'll get to these prompts even among leaders of public companies. 
	  
	  ... but a very worthwhile discussion

	- PMs are told to "define the problem"
	  
	  yet, the rush to define the problem is where a lot of PMs go wrong. 
	  
	  before you define the problem, you have to observe, suspend judgement, resist even calling it a "problem"....just take it in. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1572682956631863296))
	- We can be extremely clear...
	  ..but rigid, contrived, and prescriptive
	  
	  We can be very flexible...
	  ...but ambiguous and vague
	  
	  We can be clear and enabling...
	  ...but ultimately our communication is incongruent with other goals / objectives / principles
	  
	  Communication is hard!

	- This is a super effective way to guide people towards framing outcomes AND to differentiate the idea of WHAT we are attempting to measure and HOW we are measuring it.
	  
	  Has been a game-changer at @Amplitude_HQ with customers and future customers new to being more outcome oriented

	- All of us have an opportunity to
	  
	  -Become aware of our defaults & where they come from
	  
	  -Be curious about other people's defaults
	  
	  -Challenge our defaults
	  
	  -Challenge our defaults as the only way to achieve specific results

	- I asked ChatGPT to write causal chains for 8 "wicked loops" in product
	  
	  1. Premature convergence
	  2. Knowledge loss/turnover
	  3. Decision quality/burnout
	  4. Lack of customer knowledge
	  5. Reactive leadership
	  6. Low middle management support
	  7. UX debt
	  8. Low code quality

	- Instead of offering [some way] as an innovate way to a solve for a core need, the #agile community often derides the need as backward. 
	  
	  Governance? Planning? Run for the hills!
	  
	  I love how [[Beyond Budgeting]] / @bbogsnes acknowledges core needs and presents a viable alternative.
