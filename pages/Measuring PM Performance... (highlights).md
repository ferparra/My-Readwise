	- Measuring PM Performance is Tough (thread)
	  
	  1/ Consider this scenario: Two product managers are each given a big idea to run with. The first PM mobilizes the troops, creates alignment, pushes a big project forward, and launches. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ItamarGilad/status/1615688365151748096))

	- 2/ The second PM conducts research and comes back with evidence that the idea is not worth pursuing. 
	  
	  Which PM is more likely to get a promotion? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ItamarGilad/status/1615688367752253441))
	- 3/ There are a few important issues to discuss.
	  
	  The first is that the PMs are asked to pursue an idea (do this) rather than a goal (achieve this). 
	  
	  As most ideas fail, it would have been better to let the PM (and team) pursue an outcome goal. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ItamarGilad/status/1615688369626816512))
	- 4/ However, that's not how most companies work, and many PMs find themselves in the situation of having to "run with an idea". 
	  
	  The second question is what behavior the company motivates. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ItamarGilad/status/1615688371484999680))
	- 5/ @shreyas
	   offers a useful model to explain how most companies evaluate PM performance: 
	  
	  Perf = Product Scope x Unique Impact

	- 6/ Product scope can mean "how much of the product is under your influence", but also "how many people work on your ideas", and "how many committees are you sitting on". 
	  
	  It's a pretty subjective measure that can motivate people to inflate their projects/teams/activities. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ItamarGilad/status/1615688375859552257))
	- 7/ In the example above PM #1 created a big, visible project ("high scope"). PM #2 evaluated the idea in cheap ways and came back with evidence rather than code ("low scope"). 
	  
	  So the wrong definition of scope can go against product discovery. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ItamarGilad/status/1615688377763876871))
	- 8/ Impact is even more subjective. 
	  
	  In many companies high impact = high output. Typically this means launching big, visible product changes, or driving big sweeping changes across the org (eg implementing a new process). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ItamarGilad/status/1615688379735089152))
	- 9/ Another way to interpret impact:  High Impact = Great Execution 
	  
	  A high-impact employee reliably executes on the tasks given to them.  
	  
	  PM #2 didn't use any of these definitions. She optimized for outcomes, and she didn't just follow instructions. 
	  Again, going against perf. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ItamarGilad/status/1615688381706502144))
	- 10/ A solution could be to pin impact and scope on outcomes. But outcomes are harder to measure, and harder still to attribute to an individual (success has many fathers).  
	  
	  Some companies won't see the point. They want strong executers that gratify their managers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ItamarGilad/status/1615688383459639297))
	- 11/ There's a bigger problem yet 
	  It's generally hard to measure the performance of an individual that a) Deals with a lot of uncertainty b) Is  dependent on other people to do the work c) Works in org context he/she doesn't control. 
	  
	  You might do everything right and still fail ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ItamarGilad/status/1615688385561264129))
	- 12/ Some alternative PM perf criteria might be:
	  -- How much do they know their stuff?
	  -- How good are they to work with?
	  -- Do they use the right decision processes?
	  -- Do they consistently contribute to positive outcomes (external and internal)? 
	  
	  Harder to measure, though. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ItamarGilad/status/1615688387763048449))
	- 13/ A bigger meta question is whether we should measure performance and "optimize" individuals, or should we do these things at the level of the org and its subparts. 
	  
	  Are we optimizing cogs in a machine, or helping imperfect humans colab better and achieve more? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ItamarGilad/status/1615688389805719558))
