	- Prices are pushed away from their fundamental values because of a variety
	  of demand pressures and institutional frictions, and, although prices are kept in
	  check by intense competition among money managers, this process leads the
	  market to become inefficient to an efficient extent: just inefficient enough that
	  money managers can be compensated for their costs and risks through superior
	  performance and just efficient enough that the rewards to money management
	  after all costs do not encourage entry of new managers or additional capital. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfcqtkbcvfq87x2cdt7szv1))
	- Liquidity is the ability to transact, so when money managers “provide li-
	  quidity,” it means that they help other investors transact by taking the other side
	  of their trades. Money managers profit because demanders of liquidity value
	  the opportunity to transact at prices that are not exactly equal to fundamental
	  values (just like you are willing to buy a burger for more than the value of
	  the ingredients). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfcra1t4t4y5rb2hqe018px))

	- While discretionary trading has the advantages of a tailored analysis of each
	  trade and the use of soft information such as private conversations, its labor-
	  intensive method implies that only a limited number of securities can be analyzed
	  in depth, and the discretion exposes the trader to psychological biases. Quan-
	  titative trading has the advantage of being able to apply a trading idea to thou-
	  sands of securities around the globe, benefiting from significant diversification.
	  Furthermore, quants can apply their trading ideas with the discipline of a robot.
	  Discipline is important for all traders, but as the saying goes, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfct6hzajfnyjkd8exasd34))
	- Bulls get rich, bears get rich, but pigs get slaughtered.
	  According to this saying, you can make money taking long positions (bulls)
	  or taking short positions (bears), but if you don’t control your risk (pigs), you
	  end up going out of business. In my interview with George Soros, he explains
	  that he too puts significant emphasis on risk management, but he feels that
	  one should go for the jugular in the rare cases when the upside is large and the
	  downside is limited. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfctjzkrnxczy0gc9q1r6bk))
		- **Note**: The saying "Bulls get rich, bears get rich, but pigs get slaughtered" means that you can make money if you buy stocks (bulls) or sell stocks (bears), but if you don't watch how much risk you take (pigs), you could lose all your money. George Soros said that it is important to be careful with risk, but sometimes when the potential to make money is really big, you should take a chance.
