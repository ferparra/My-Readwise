	- If you ever show me a “user story” in the form of “As a user, I want to _ so that I can _” here are some of the questions I’m going to ask, so we might as well figure out the answers up front so we can skip to a set of much more interesting questions that will come later: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lauraklein/status/1520908876790468609))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1. What sort of user? Power user? Occasional? New user? Internal? External? Are there any behavioral or demographic specifics that make them different from other users? 
	  2. What percentage of users does this type of user represent? How many other types are there? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lauraklein/status/1520908878489485313))
	- 3. Is this the group of users whose needs we want to address right now? Why? Are we trying to improve a particular metric for that specific type of user? Are they particularly underserved by the product or important to our business or other goals? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lauraklein/status/1520908880179777536))
	- 4. Why do these users want to do the thing you claim they want to do? Are they only doing it because we have trained them to do it? What is their actual intent or end goal? 
	  5. How do we know they want to do this? Is this based on research or optimism or vibes? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lauraklein/status/1520908881647394816))
	- 6. Are the action and goal actually the same? For example, is it “I want to log in so that I can see my logged in information?” If so, stop that. Also, nobody wants to log in. You don’t need to write that sort of requirement as a user story like this. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lauraklein/status/1520908883136368640))
	- There aren't really right answers to these questions (except for #5, where "research" is the only answer I'll accept & #6), but these are all things I need to know in order to formulate more specific questions that will then lead to an actual design and implementation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lauraklein/status/1520908885489500160))
	- I don't even expect a PM or other stakeholder to know the answer to all these questions upfront, but I expect whoever is writing the story to be willing to dive into these questions with me and start getting answers & to pivot if the answers don't support moving forward.
