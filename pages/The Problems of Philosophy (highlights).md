	- We have to ask ourselves whether, in any sense at all, there is such a thing as matter. Is there a table which has a certain intrinsic nature, and continues to exist when I am not looking, or is the table merely a product of my imagination, a dream- table in a very prolonged dream? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhrym2j5bm1kgt20mp3p2f3))
	- Awareness of universals is called *conceiving,* and a universal of which we are aware is called a *concept.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhryxgv3200ppesfpccmz8e))
	- If we are to be able to draw inferences from these data--if we are to know of the existence of matter, of other people, of the past before our individual memory begins, or of the future, we must know general principles of some kind by means of which such inferences can be drawn.

	- There are a number of other principles which cannot be proved or disproved by experience, but are used in arguments which start from what is experienced. Some of these principles have even greater evidence than the principle of induction, and the knowledge of them has the same degree of certainty as the knowledge of the existence of sense-data.

	- Our knowledge of truths, unlike our knowledge of things, has an opposite, namely *error*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhrzrs04ffd8rz2akbjfhgr))
	- Philosophers have advanced arguments tending to show that there could be no infinite collections of things, and that therefore the number of points in space, or of instants in time, must be finite. Thus a contradiction emerged between the apparent nature of space and time and the supposed impossibility of infinite collections. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhs0kax7egefkrr50j05qgq))
	- [Kant](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant), who first emphasized this contradiction, deduced the impossibility of space and time, which he declared to be merely subjective ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhs0v9cawkkcd8qzzwg5hn1))

	- Utility does not belong to philosophy. If the study of philosophy has any value at all for others than students of philosophy, it must be only indirectly, through its effects upon the lives of those who study it. It is in these effects, therefore, if anywhere, that the value of philosophy must be primarily sought. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhs17v5gejj5vygx8t6mnhp))
	- There is a widespread philosophical tendency towards the view which tells us that Man is the measure of all things, that truth is man-made ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhs1w18w3f1ejxem2nmt5wv))
	- Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions, since no definite answers can, as a rule, be known to be true, but rather for the sake of the questions themselves; because these questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich our intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic assurance which closes the mind against speculation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhs2bvkpfvjn2famz4yg5rr))
