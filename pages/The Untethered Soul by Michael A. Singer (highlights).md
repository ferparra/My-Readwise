	- Currently, your life isn’t your own. It belongs instead to what you might think of as an “inner roommate.” You “hear” this voice as the endless flow and flux of your thoughts (“Did I turn off the coffee maker? I wonder what’s on TV tonight?”). Because the voice speaks to you as the voice of your own mind, you’ve mistakenly come to believe that it is you.

	- Your inner roommate’s narration of your life is a defense mechanism. Your roommate feels intrinsically afraid of and antagonistic toward the world, so it tries to control it by giving you a mentally filtered model of the world to experience instead of the unpredictable world outside your mind.

	- The very act of noticing your roommate’s voice is the beginning of freedom from it. By simply noticing it, you disidentify from it and recognize that you are not it. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/fd7c480a-2461-4941-8abd-7377c2798004))
	- Realize that you don’t have to believe your inner roommate. Your inner voice isn’t reality. It’s merely a commotion about life, not life itself. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/75a2d817-eef9-40fe-a8dd-6ca108ee5106))
	- understand that the most important thing in your actual experience of life is inner energy. This energy has laws and follows patterned behavior just like physical energy in the outer world. It behaves by surging and receding, as governed by the condition of your heart (see below). When it flows, you feel supercharged and able to take on the world. When it doesn’t, you feel drained and depressed. You can know the current state and level of your inner energy by paying attention to your relative level of vitality, enthusiasm, joy, and inspiration.

	- Just like cycles of opening and closing, for most people life is a recurrent, automatic cycle of falling into unhappiness and dysfunction and then rising back to a relative state of clarity and ease. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/b1b5f7b6-6a74-492d-a6e7-a06b32ee37a7))
	- You fall because you fear life and therefore resist it. You fear life because of its inherent uncertainty, so you use your mind to create a false world of static stability. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/3d40917c-4f78-4b3f-bcf9-5cb1021f4a26))
	- Freedom from fear is possible, and thus freedom from falling is possible. It simply means refusing to fight with life. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/34279a7e-7e3a-4af0-acb4-da30edeb37ea))
	- Imagine your pain as a thorn. It’s embedded in your arm, right on a nerve. Should you respond by removing the thorn or by making sure that nothing touches it? If you decide on the second option, protecting your pain will consume your life: You’ll build a thorn-shaped life as your daily actions revolve around shielding the painful spot.

	- The very core of spiritual work is to become comfortable and free by letting pain pass through you. If you do this, you’ll learn that in addition to stored-up pain, you also have joy, beauty, love, peace, freedom, and ecstasy inside you.
