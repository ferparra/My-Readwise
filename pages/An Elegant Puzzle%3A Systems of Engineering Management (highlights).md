- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Feb 21st, 2023]]
	- When I want to solve a problem quickly and cheaply, I think about process design. If process is too weak a force, culture too slow, and there isn’t much time, then organizational design is a good option ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntj0f3t9f81qda22y3ra9x))
		- **Note**: This document discusses the various methods of problem-solving, such as process design, culture, and organizational design. It suggests that if the problem needs a quick and cost-effective solution, then organizational design is a good option.
	- One of the fundamental challenges of organizational design is sizing teams ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntj8zsdts2qh42r6w4b82c))
	- Managers should support 6-8 engineers and managers-of-managers should support 4-6 managers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntjctdc774y3tyzwm4vzfs))
	- A team is at least 4 people as this diversity helps attack and solve complex problems in a more efficient manner ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntjn4t75b1943s54xh047b))
	- •   Keep innovation and maintenance together as this leads to higher morale and will avoid creating a two-tiered class system of innovators and maintainers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntjxdbqhhzgf1ncbsbytkt))
	- 4 states of a team and the general solution. Teams want to climb from falling behind to innovating, while entropy drags them backward. Each
	  
	  1.  Falling behind – add people
	  2.  Treading water – reduce WIP
	  3.  Repaying debt – add time
	  4.  Innovating – add slack ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntk0awkvpga6e386amn7st))
		- **Note**: The article discusses how teams can progress from a state of falling behind to innovating. To do this, there are four stages the team must traverse and each stage requires a different solution: adding people to fall behind, reducing work in progress to tread water, adding time to repay debt, and adding slack to innovate.
	- Consolidate your efforts as a leader. Don’t “peanut butter” the situation by trying to evenly spread yourself out. Spend the most time on the teams that need the most help. Adding new individuals to teams disrupts that team’s gelling process, so have rapid growth periods followed by consolidation/gelling periods ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntkp5srsd9rjd9f0ng5sf2))
		- **Tags**: #[[leadership]]
		- **Note**: As a leader, it is important to focus on the teams that need the most help rather than trying to spread yourself out evenly. It is better to have rapid growth periods followed by periods of consolidation and team-building, as adding new people to a team can disrupt its cohesion.
	- Do not separate high-performing teams. They can tackle new problems but should stay together. Shifting scope works better than moving people because it avoids re-gelling costs, and it preserves system behavior. You can also try rotating individuals for a fixed period into an area that needs help
	  
	  1.  *Campbell – Teams > Individuals > Problems* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntmhrt2z98wzzzkx7xv7gk))
		- **Note**: According to Campbell, teams should be kept together to tackle new problems, as shifting scope works better than moving people and preserves system behavior. Individuals can be rotated into areas that need help for a fixed period of time.
	- Counterintuitively, you can slow a team down by shifting resources to it, because doing so creates new upstream constraints. Slack is a beautiful thing. It gives people and teams time to improve areas and do it with minimal coordination costs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntn4w80cfb2g5bw3xaqrzv))
		- **Note**: This text explains how shifting resources to a team can actually cause it to work more slowly due to the new upstream constraints that result. It also argues that having slack, or extra time, is beneficial as it allows for improvement with minimal coordination costs.
	- You only get values from projects you finish. To make progress, above all else, you must ensure that some of your projects finish ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntnr91vm15kz8esrr54g15))
		- **Note**: This passage emphasizes the importance of completing projects in order to achieve progress and get tangible outcomes. It suggests that the most important thing to do is to ensure that some of the projects are completed.
	- **Block out large chunks of time each week to focus**. Telecommute, block out 8-11 each morning, experiment until you find something that works for you. The best solution is a culture of documentation – read documents, and a documentation reach that actually works. **Try to get off the “critical path” – don’t be a gatekeeper.** This is a significant implementation bug rather than a stability feature to be emulated (except for very important legal/financial/other matters that should have a gatekeeper.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntp13xb67dj4mbjspq8067))
		- **Note**: This document advises engineering managers to block out large chunks of their weekly schedule for focusing, telecommuting, and reading documents to create a culture of documentation. Additionally, it suggests not being a gatekeeper, except for very important matters that require one.
	- Organizational debt – the sibling of technical debt and represents things like biased interview processes and inequitable compensation mechanisms, systemic problems which prevents your organization from reaching its potential. Responding to this is central to being an effective leader. A great way to attack this is to focus on a few areas you want to improve and if you’re making progress, feel good about it. You can slack off on the other areas (for now). You can’t do it all at once ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntpn65xgqqf3e7cgk7k3b7))
		- **Note**: Organizational debt, such as biased interview processes and inequitable compensation mechanisms, can prevent an organization from reaching its full potential. In order to be an effective leader, one must focus on a few areas to improve and make progress, while being able to slack off on the other areas temporarily. It is not possible to tackle every issue at once.
	- Succession planning is thinking through how the organization would function without you, documenting those gaps, and starting to fill them in. This is often overlooked but is vital for the long-term success of your team and organization. First step is to figure out what you do – write down what meetings you attend, what your role is in those meetings, recurring processes, individuals you support, emails you send, requests coming in, to-do lists, external relationships. Taking 2-3-week vacations is actually a beautiful thing – you can see what slips through the cracks and these items can be the start of next year’s list. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntqvcdtq8aaceregx3258j))
		- **Note**: Succession planning is an important step for the long-term success of an organization. It involves documenting the roles and responsibilities of an individual and figuring out how the organization would function without them. To do this, the individual should write down what meetings they attend, processes they manage, individuals they support, and emails they send. Taking vacations can be used to identify any gaps that appear in the individual's absence.
	- Creating an arena for quickly testing hypotheses about how things work, without having to do the underlying work beforehand, is the aspect of systems thinking that I appreciate most ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntrvw22n32gmf8nxehafst))
		- **Tags**: #[[experimentation]]
	- For problem discovery look at – users’ pain, users’ purpose, benchmark, cohorts, competitive advantages/moats ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntr6acabd5zkhh3f9d97yf))
		- **Tags**: #[[product discovery]]
	- Presenting to senior management
	  
	  1.  Communication is company-specific
	  
	  1.  Start with the conclusion
	  2.  Frame why the topic matters
	  3.  Everyone loves a narrative
	  4.  Prepare for detours
	  5.  Answer directly
	  6.  Dive deep into the data
	  7.  Derive actions from principles
	  8.  Discuss the details
	  9.  Prepare a lot, practice a little
	  10.  Make a clear ask ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntsg1fhqspmvqedb6yerr2))
		- **Tags**: #[[communication]] #[[stakeholder management]]
		- **Note**: When presenting to senior management, it is important to communicate in a way that is specific to the company. Start with the conclusion and frame why the topic matters. Everyone likes a story, so make sure to include one. Be prepared for detours and answer questions directly. Include data to make your point, and derive actions from principles. Discuss the details, but practice only a little. Lastly, make a clear ask.
	- Communicating with teams/peers
	  
	  1.  Be a facilitator, not a lecturer
	  2.  Brief presentations, long discussions
	  3.  Small breakout groups
	  4.  Bring learnings to the full group
	  5.  Choose topics that people already know about
	  6.  Encourage tenured folks to attend
	  7.  Optional pre-reads
	  8.  Checking-in – your name, your team, one sentence about what’s on your mind
	  9.  Every quarter I spend a few hours categorizing my calendar from the past 3 months to figure out how I’ve invested my time. This is useful for me to reflect on the major projects I’ve done, and also to get a sense of my general allocation of time. I then use this analysis to shuffle my goal time allocation for the next quarter ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsnttsstenrwhr933za6j996))
		- **Tags**: #[[communication]]
		- **Note**: This document outlines strategies for effectively communicating with teams and peers. These strategies include being a facilitator instead of a lecturer, having short presentations and longer discussions, forming small breakout groups, choosing topics people already know about, encouraging tenured people to attend, providing optional pre-reads, and doing a quarterly evaluation of time investment.
	- Strong relationships > any problem. Start debugging problems from the relationship angle before anything else. With the right people, any process works, and with the wrong people, no process works ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntvvr4xe246ag4y5txmqz3))

	- Culture
	  
	  1.  An inclusive organization is one in which individuals have access to opportunity and membership
	  2.  Useful metrics – retention, usage rate, level distribution, time at level
	  3.  Useful programs – recurring weekly events, employee resource groups, team offsites, coffee chats, team lunches,
	  4.  Ingredients for a great ream – awareness of each other’s work, evolution from character to person, refereeing defection, avoiding zero-sum culture
	  5.  The best learning doesn’t always come from your manager – create a community of learning with your peers
	  6.  Humans are prone to interpreting events as causal, but it may be more appropriate to see problems in terms of a series of stockpiles that grow and shrink based on incoming and outgoing flows ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntx74225hcm8ah8qbf6mrj))
		- **Note**: This document discusses how to create an inclusive organizational culture, with metrics and programs that help foster this. It emphasizes the importance of creating a community of learning between peers rather than just the manager, and suggests that it is better to see problems in terms of flows and stockpiles rather than causality.
	- Interviewing tips
	  
	  1.  Be kind to the candidate
	  2.  Ensure that all interviewers agree on the role’s requirements
	  3.  Understand the signal your interview is checking for
	  4.  Come to your interview prepared to interview
	  5.  Deliberately express interest in candidates
	  6.  Create feedback loops for interviewers and the loop’s designer
	  7.  Instrument and optimize as you would any conversion funnel ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsntxq9en9tbpxp3yrwb807q))
		- **Tags**: #[[interviewing]]
		- **Note**: When interviewing candidates for a given role, it is important to be kind and express interest in them. All interviewers should agree on the role's requirements, come to the interview prepared, and understand the signal being checked for. To ensure a successful interviewing process, feedback loops should be created among interviewers and the loop's designer, and the process should be optimized like any other conversion funnel.
