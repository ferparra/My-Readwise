	  So there's a lot of arguing and thinking going on about this right now. Amy Edmondson kind of coined the term psychological safety that was then used in the Google Project Aristotle research that like teams that have psych safety tend to outperform ones that don't and psych safety was defined essentially as you can take interpersonal risks at work without fearing for your very existence, fearing that you'd be unduly criticized or even let go. So it's about people taking risks. And the way we tend to do this is by recontextualizing failure. So failure is, as you know, and you've talked about it on the show quite a bit actually, failure is perceived as this like real death of the ego. It gets a toxic, terrible, scary, horrible thing and nobody wants to fail. But then whenever you hear anyone who has achieved anything, they always talk about learning and failure and how they go hand in glove and how important that is. And so you have to have a culture where failure, we call it noble failure, is understood and appreciated as a necessary ingredient in learning. And you have to have a culture where the idea of what it means to be a leader is not about ensuring perfect execution, which is what that Tayloristic version of management was. That was you ensure perfect execution. That is your job. And now the idea is I want you to ensure continually growing capability, which is a totally different animal. And so continuing going capability means I need a system that is learning all the time while it's executing. And that means I'm going to have to make trade offs in terms of the short term performance for the long term performance.
