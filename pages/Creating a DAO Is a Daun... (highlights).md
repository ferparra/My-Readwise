	- Creating a DAO is a daunting, complicated process.
	  
	  Creating a DAO, & then having it registered in Wyoming is even more complicated.
	  
	  That's why for the @beondeck hackathon, we built DaoNao - a platform to create + incorporate your Wyoming DAO in just 5 clicks.

	- For context: Our team (@KananRengaraju, @TheEthanDing, @SamuelKronick, @ngeloxyz) built out our MVP this weekend.
	  
	  1) The first step was building a simple front-end to fill out the typical DAO details:
	- 2) Once the DAO details are collected - we use @daostack to incorporate the DAO on Ethereum: https://t.co/5HFvuWlXGO.
	  
	  Sample of the code:

	- 3) After the DAO is created - you fill out a couple more details to register your Wyoming DAO.
	- 4) We use a simple PDF filler to automate the paperwork that comes with filing a Wyoming DAO (https://t.co/gOyg9021Xz) atm.
	  
	  The PDF then gets sent straight to your email.
	  
	  Ideally, there's a corporate registry API that makes it really easy to automate this in the future. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xkaito/status/1414297275388493824))
	- This was a really fun project to hack out this weekend.
