document_note:: Tony Hsieh is the CEO of Zappos and his book "Delivering Happiness" is about avoiding the mistakes he made and inspiring people to be more entrepreneurial. He was very entrepreneurial as a child and went on to found LinkExchange, which was sold to Microsoft for $625M. He then invested in Zappos and eventually became its CEO. He emphasizes the importance of being conscious of culture and making decisions with a customer experience lens rather than cost minimization. He also stresses the importance of experiences over material things and of sharing happiness with others. He outlines four frameworks for happiness and three types of happiness, and emphasizes the importance of working towards your own happiness and bringing happiness to others.
