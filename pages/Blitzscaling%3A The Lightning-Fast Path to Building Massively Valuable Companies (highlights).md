document_note:: Blitzscaling is a strategic innovation which aims to put speed over efficiency when pursuing growth, even in the face of uncertainty. It is a risky decision, but if the competitor has taken the path, it is less risky than doing nothing. Companies which have 60% growth when they reach $100 million in revenues are 8x more likely to reach $1 billion. It involves five phases: family, tribe, village, city and nation. Business model innovation is key to success, and founders should only blitzscale when speed is the ultimate super power. The strategy works as both offense and defense, and one should raise more cash than they think they need. The role and skills needed by the CEO and top management change with every level and size of the company. It is important to differentiate between first mover and first scaler advantage, and other common patterns of dominant businesses are explored.

	- Startups, just like certain materials and chemicals, go through phase changes. A dominant global leader is not simply a startup times of thousand it is a fundamentally different machine. Just as ice skates are useless on water, the same tactics used in the startup may be useless once you have achieved product market fit.

	- The five phases of Blitzscaling: Family, tribe, village, city, nation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmkz573bbz6svq8z3r88nf9))
		- **Note**: Blitzscaling is a process of rapid growth and development, which is divided into five distinct phases. These phases progress from Family, which is focused on building a core team, to Tribe which is focused on building a loyal customer base, to Village which is focused on scaling the product and organization, to City which is focused on making the company defensible, to Nation which is focused on global expansion and industry leadership.
	- The revenue model don’t have to be perfect when you do it. Your only goal is scale into a market that is winner take all or winner take most. However, not every company should blitzscale if product-market fit isn’t there or if the business model isn’t there ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmkzvdnenaevmp5ykvk6ctw))
	- Business model growth factors
	  
	  1.  Market size – paying customers, great distribution, fixed and expanding margins
	  2.  Distribution – leveraging existing networks, virality
	  3.  High gross margins – more revenues lead to more cash on hand which can be put to use, more attractive to investors
	  4.  Network effects – direct, indirect, two sided, local, compatibility and standards ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmm07anqppgjbvt0tb15ea1))
	- 8 key transitions
	  
	  1.  From small teams to large teams. This can be a tough psychological change for founders and early employees as it is now impossible to be part of every decision and have clarity into every department
	  2.  From generalists to specialists
	  3.  From managers to executives. Executives organize and lead managers and managers execute day to day operations. Hire people who are known to at least one current team member, start them small and let them prove their value and gain other’s trust, then think about promoting them
	  4.  From dialogue to broadcasting. Establishing formal and consistent communication is extremely important as you grow. Chesky sends out a weekly email on Sunday nights which highlight growth metrics but also give the team updates and clarity on how the company is doing and other important topics so that everyone continues to feel involved and informed
	  5.  From improvisation and inspiration to data. At the beginning you have no customers to listen to but over time you have to track team metrics and analyze the data so that you can improve and adapt. Track the number of user’s raw engagement and churn to begin with and then customize and go deeper as is necessary for your product or service. No company should have more than 3 to 5 metrics as more tends to lead to confusion. It doesn’t necessarily matter what data you collect but what data gets presented to decision-makers.
	  6.  From single threading to multithreading. The author doesn’t know of one start up that didn’t start out as singularly focused. They can branch out from there but it is important to have a deep focus when you’re first getting started
	  7.  From pirate to navy. From continuous offense to a blend of offense and defense. You must strike a balance between the power of being small and nimble and the benefits of being large and having scale. Much like JBS Haldane stipulates, you are fundamentally different when you scale. You can’t run a city the same way you run a tribe and you can’t run a nation the same way you run a city
	  8.  From founder to leader. Your role as the founder will change as the company scales and grows and you must adapt to it or you won’t be serving the company as it needs you to. You have to keep your personal learning curve ahead of the businesses’ growth curve. There are three ways to scale yourself: delegation, amplification, and simply getting better.

	- Common patterns of dominant businesses:
	  
	  1.  Bits versus atoms (software/digital rather than physical)
	  2.  Platforms
	  3.  Free or freemium
	  4.  Marketplaces
	  5.  Subscriptions
	  6.  Digital goods
	  7.  Newsfeeds which drive user engagement and retention ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmm105r22ezg0zqjjst2md7))
	- You must focus on adaptation rather than optimization ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmm1szpjfjq6knw9we49xr7))
	- You should always have a plan a Plan B and plan Z that you can fall back on in case your first option doesn’t work out and then your option in case worst case scenarios come up ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmm1jrh60krf4akrhq3pdfn))
	- Tolerate bad management. At the beginning it is more important to move quickly than to have perfect organization and processes in place ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmm1cs5wy7da4kn2f2d5b1k))
	- Launch a product that embarrasses you. You don’t want to wait so long until it’s perfect want to get out and see what the market thinks of it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmm17n1garnnjamvmmfvf3v))
