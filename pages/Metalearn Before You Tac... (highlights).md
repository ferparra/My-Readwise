	  â€¢ What are the benefits?
	  â€¢ What are the costs?
	  â€¢ What are the alternatives?

	  1) Find learning resources
	  2) Identify learning methods
	  3) Sequence the subskills
	  4) Plan the learning tasks
	  5) Reflect and adapt often ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1618292697927938054))
