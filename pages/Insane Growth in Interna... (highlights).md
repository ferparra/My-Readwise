	- Insane growth in international RevPAR (‚ÄúRevenue Per Available Room‚Äù) at $MAR. +76% in Europe, +113% in AsiaPac ex China. Driven by much higher occupancy & room rates (rates +40% y/y in AsiaPac!). 
	  
	  If you didn‚Äôt take a cheap vacation abroad last year‚Ä¶ Too bad üò¢! Now pay up!

	- The earnings report was strong (superb execution!) & outlook was raised by quite a bit, but stock is flat year-on-year because of ongoing recession concerns. Trading at 22x current year P/E & 14x EBITDA for 14-18% forward EBITDA growth. Cheap or expensive? Recession or not? ü§î
