	- The Most Efficient Short-Form MBA That One Can Find
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Michael Porter's book, Competitive Strategy, is an efficient shortform MBA that can help entrepreneurs understand the dynamics of industry., * Reading the first three chapters of the book can be beneficial for entrepreneurs.)

	  Speaker 2
	  All right, so I wanted to start with a number of things that I've seen pop up repeatedly in various forms in doing prep for this conversation. And the first I wanted to get your take on and expansion on is Michael Porter's book, Competitive Strategy, Subtidal Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors, which you have described, I believe, as the most efficient short-form MBA that one can find. Could you please explain what this book is and if you still hold that opinion, why you hold that opinion?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  If you do go to get an MBA, like in the first semester or whatever, they usually make you take a corporate strategy course and it's the first book assigned. It's like extremely well-known business book. There's a belief in Silicon Valley that an MBA is worthless and people shit on it all the time. Yeah, right. Yet, I would say 80 or 90% of the entrepreneurs I meet would benefit greatly by reading the first three chapters of this book. And it's really just about trying to understand the dynamics of industry. One of the most common mistakes entrepreneurs make is they come up with some kind of technological breakthrough in their own mind, but they don't spend any time analyzing the industry structure or whether the go-to market is gonna be possible or not. And the book just has a wonderful framework for thinking about the competitive dynamics of an industry and whether or not you'd be able to break in or be successful or maintain success.

	  Speaker 2
	  So you mentioned Howard Marks, Oaktree Capital, who's been on the podcast twice, very, very impressive fallacy. I've seen you mention two investors, and I'm sure you've mentioned more, but two have come up repeatedly in various interviews and so on, Howard Marks and Stan Druckenmiller. Could you please speak to what makes them impressive or interesting to you?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Sometime in the last four or five years when interest rates wouldn't get away from zero for so long, I told myself I have to learn more about macro because I just know nothing and it's causing all kinds of problems in my industry. I had been reading Howard's work for years. One of the things I just love about people like Howard and Buffett does it, but like people who archive their thought process, just as part of their own process. But it's quite kind if you're a learner in the field that have someone of that capability that insists upon writing these letters and making them public, which they've done. I started reading Howard's work when I was on the sell side 25 years ago. ([Time 0:17:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/afdcfb3a-2c4a-40ed-a207-4e3bbd96e7ab))
