	- 0/ The math connecting lenders <> borrowers on protocols such as @compoundfinance and @AaveAave comes right after @Uniswap's constant product function when it comes to influencing the whole DeFi industry. Strangely, it hasn't been challenged the same way. This might change ðŸ‘‡

	- 1/ The size of the bid<>ask spread on those protocols is a measure of the space still available for optimisation. And the guys at @MorphoLabs listened. What is Morpho? Morpho is a front-running peer-to-peer lending overlay to @compoundfinance and @AaveAave, with huge ambitions

	- 2/ How will @MorphoLabs work? Simple and genius. Sitting on top of lending protocols such as @compoundfinance - and mimicking all their parameters, they can intercept borrowing and lending asks and match them at mid rates for as long as they want, dramatically optimising rates ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LucaProsperi/status/1507065856047648769))
	- 3/ Unless there are heavy incentivisation programs involved (not sustainable for a long time) @MorphoLabs can by construct be Pareto-efficient in improving everybody's conditions. Detractors call it a vampire attacks, philosophers an ode to DeFi composability ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LucaProsperi/status/1507065857813491716))
	- 4/ If you are feeling the vibes of a @ConvexFinance-esque play you are not alone. At this stage it doesnâ€™t seem that @MorphoLabs intends to offer the ability to recursively play the "ve" game. This doesnâ€™t mean this wonâ€™t ever happen ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LucaProsperi/status/1507065859432452100))
	- 5/ @MorphoLabs acknowledge they are dependent on the same businesses they want to disrupt, and are already envisaging an evolutionary path based on three main phases: Caterpillar, Chrysalis, and Butterfly. In its ultimate form, it might move rate setting to the world of AMMs ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LucaProsperi/status/1507065860988493827))
	- 6/ Will that be the end game for crypto lending? No way.  Now stablecoin protocols such as @MakerDAO might find a much more powerful way to set market rates - vs. the timid D3M attempt. Next step, they might move to own their own liquidity as well as pioneered by @OlympusDAO...

	- 7/ We are getting closer and closer to the sun, and to the ultimate question: what is the nominal risk-free rate of native crypto money markets? And who sets it? To me, staking rewards are the ultimate, true, nominal risk-free rate of any decentralised native financial system ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LucaProsperi/status/1507065867615494151))
	- 8/ @terra_money's @anchor_protocol idea of incorporating base layer's staking yield (i.e. by bonding $LUNA, $ETH, $SOl, etc.) while acting as a maturity transformer is indeed great. Whether they are doing it sustainably is a different topic - see below

	- 9/ It is a good occasion for a powerful heuristic of macro investing: the excess return you are enjoying vs. the risk-free proxy is always proportional to the additional risk you are running. If you are thinking otherwise, you are fooling yourself.
