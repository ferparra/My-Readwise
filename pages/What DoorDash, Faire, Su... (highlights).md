	- What DoorDash, Faire, Substack, Eventbrite, and Cameo have in common? They all have what I call "magical" growth loops: loops where most of your growth comes from existing users. I've collected 30+ examples of these loops in action.
	  
	  A few examples belowðŸ‘‡

	- 1/ Context: Normally, to grow your business, YOU need to go find every new users or customer. For example, if youâ€™re building Google, you need to go tell people about Google and convince them to use Google. Each additional Google user doesnâ€™t directly drive more Google users.

	- 2/ However, if youâ€™re building a product like DoorDash, Faire, Substack, Dropbox, Eventbrite, and many of the companies I cover in this post, a very cool thing can happen: your users grow your business for you. THEY recruit your new users. Magical! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1328739797825855488))
	- 3/ Hereâ€™s an example from Cameo, a marketplace where fans purchase short videos from celebrities to surprise and delight their friends. Without a magical growth loop, Cameo would have to go recruit both celebrities AND fans:

	- 4/ Instead, Cameo found that if they recruit celebrities, the celebrities themselves bring the fans to the marketplace:

	- 5/ This loop is present in many forms and can work across marketplaces, platforms, social apps, and SaaS.
	  
	  There are four broad categories of this loop in action:
	  1. Supply driving demand
	  2. Demand driving supply
	  3. Demand driving demand (e.g. virality)
	  4. Supply driving supply ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1328739807510491137))
	- 6/ Type 1: Supply driving demand, e.g. @DoorDash 
	  
	  1. DoorDash recruits restaurant
	  2. The restaurant tells its customers about DoorDash so that they can order delivery from them
	  3. Customers signup for DoorDash

	- 7/ Type 2: Demand driving supply, e.g. @faire_wholesale 
	  
	  1. Faire recruits retailer, who buys an item through Faire and has a good experience
	  2. Retailer encourages their other vendors to list on Faire
	  3. Vendors join and begin selling through Faire

	- 8/ Type 3: Demand driving demand, e.g. @figmadesign 
	  
	  1. Figma recruits employee at a company
	  2. Employee sends invites to co-workers, to share designs
	  3. Co-workers sign up

	- 9/ Type 4: Supply driving supply, e.g. @typeform 
	  
	  1. Creator sends out a survey
	  2. Receiver takes survey and sees the logo/link
	  3. Receiver creates their own survey ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1328739820403736577))
	- 10/ See the pull post with dozens of more examples. 
	  
	  And if you know of any other examples, let me know and I'll add them.
