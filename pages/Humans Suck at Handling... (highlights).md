	- Humans suck at handling #probability. But we suck in entirely non-random ways.  Four tips:
	  
	  1. Unlikely ≠ impossible! Over time, small probability events compound. Roll the dice enough times, eventually the bad thing happens. Hence why *some* insurance policies are profitable.

	- 2.  Stop assuming fringe probabilities are 'basically the same' because they're both super low (or super high) likelihood. 
	  
	  A 0.1% and a 0.001% chance might sound similar — but one is literally 100x more likely than the other.

	- 3. Numbers > fuzzy language. Vague terms like "probably" and "occasionally" cause mayhem in the long run because people associate different probabilities with the same words (see below). 
	  
	  Avoid the drama & confusion by giving your estimates in numbered %s! https://t.co/uwDJzSXCBz
	- 4. The world is messy and complex, & anyone who claims to know the future (or the present situation) perfectly is talking crap. That said, we can still try to estimate it.
	  
	  Feynman: "Nature permits us only to calculate probabilities. Yet science has not collapsed."
	- & if you've made it this far then you're a fellow quantiphile & should check out my talk below.
	  
	  It's called "A number speaks a thousand words" and even tho the sound is crap it's good stuff:
