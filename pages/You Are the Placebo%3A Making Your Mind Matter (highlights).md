	- Attitudes are temporary beliefs and most beliefs are made up from past thoughts and experiences. They are addicting and habit forming so be very careful about your thoughts. Perception is an elongated state of being which is formed by your beliefs, attitudes, thoughts and feelings. You don't see reality as it truly is. You fill in the gaps with your beliefs and attitudes. The only way to change your perception is to change your state of being, recognizing your faulty and incomplete beliefs for what they are. This process is so difficult because we are addicted to our beliefs and take them to be truth almost all the time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gskcq5wyb0t7q5g1x06bha26))

		- **Note**: Attitudes are like temporary thoughts that we have. Most of these thoughts come from things we have seen and done before. They can become like habits and addictions, so we need to be careful about what we think. Our perception, or the way we see things, is shaped by our thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, and feelings. We don't always see things as they really are. We fill in the gaps with our beliefs and attitudes. To change our perception, we must change our thoughts and feelings, and be aware of the beliefs that might be wrong or incomplete. This is hard to do because we often get used to and trust our beliefs, even if they are not true.

	  1.  Open focus meditation is one where you focus more on space and the unknown send any particular mantra idea or thought. Enhances our energy by focusing on energy
	  2.  In this next part fully detach from your identity and become 100% immersed in the present moment. This is the sweet spot as the present moment can lead to any future
	  3.  You should allow yourself just to linger on each chakra for about 15 minutes each
	  4.  Your job is not to figure out when or where or how to make your wishes come true, simply to see it and feel it wholeheartedly ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gskcrg6pckw9v3bh3pzyzrgn))
