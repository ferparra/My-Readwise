	- I'm turning 35 today! 🎉
	  
	  As I grow older, I'm realizing the value of principles to make decisions and guide behavior. What are yours?
	  
	  Here's 35 of mine: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385349095074656259))
	- This is a thread of 35 Principles from my 35 years, but a full writeup of these will be available on my blog: https://t.co/tBGnj4Xxtr 
	  
	  and discussed on newsletter ✉️ (good reads every week!) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385349096861429768))
	- 1. Life is Too Short for Short Term Games
	  
	  We only have so many years for long term games to compound. Make 'em count.

	- 2. Writing is Stupendously High [[Leverage]] 
	  
	  It helps to organize my thoughts and learning (aka @fortelabs' Building A [[Second Brain]]), and enables me to share great ideas even while I sleep (aka it's a Friendcatcher).

	- 3. Learn in Public

	- 4. Good Enough is Better than Best
	  
	  In a world of infinite abundance, you can lose yourself constantly chasing the hottest new thing. 
	  
	  Satisfice rather than Maximize. https://t.co/uPJo8mFhEl ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385349105128411137))
	- 5. Less is More
	  
	  Minimalism wins:
	- 6. Create Clarity
	  
	  Simple Explanations of What, Why, and How are extremely underrated and extremely useful. 
	  
	  This is also a core skill of all leaders. https://t.co/4jA6bOnPyI ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385349868026155010))
	- 7. Optimize for Change
	  
	  Optimizing for anything else tends to make systems MORE fragile, not less. 
	  
	  If you learn only one lesson from Facebook's open source, learn this. https://t.co/R6Ev16cQTU ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385350030391799815))
	- 8. Seek First To Understand, Then To Be Understood 
	  
	  My personal favorite of the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Wish more of Twitter read it.
	  
	  https://t.co/3wNwOk3BIX ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385350320889352195))
	- 9. Praise in Public, Criticize in Private
	  
	  Everything is •not• awesome, and I hate people that fake positivity. But... I can either help or make them feel bad about it. The former is more effective than the latter. 
	  
	  Exception if you're harming or misleading the vulnerable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385350623571312643))
	- 10. Build an Empathy Check Habit
	  
	  Remember the story of The Fence. 
	  
	  I can't ever take back an impulsive response that hurts someone. When I can't check with trusted friends, I need to think before I tweet.  https://t.co/TprT8jHcle https://t.co/UkZL5tAfMK ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385350978459799552))
	- 11. People remember how you made them feel, before what you said.
	  
	  Watch how Bill Gates and Steve Jobs recount their 3 decades of competing with each other.
	  
	  Watch to the end. 
	  
	  Then try to recall what Bill said. https://t.co/dlivgx264i ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385352144195252224))
	- 12. Treat Others How They Want To Be Treated
	  
	  https://t.co/o7T46mIwzi ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385352302597263364))
	- 13. Complete Truths are Not Welcome 
	  
	  Most people are more interested in:
	- 14. Organize IRL Events
	  
	  You can do a LOT to create excitement and connection in a community — simply by organizing dinners, meetups and conferences.
	  
	  I randomly *decided* to hold a meetup once. This Sunday, @SvelteSociety holds its THIRD global summit.
	  
	  https://t.co/cqS5pqHEvu ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385353549689753600))
	- 15. Don't offer unsolicited help (Make Sure Help Is Wanted Before Offering It) 
	  
	  Men - be especially wary about this when women are talking about their problems. 
	  
	  Often, they just need support, not solutions. 
	  
	  (but sometimes it really is about The Nail) https://t.co/ONZEc9KBxP ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385353980021075968))
	- 16. Ask For Help More
	  
	  People are happy to help and *like you more* when they have helped you. 
	  
	  Don't worry about showing weakness; you are getting something far more valuable in return.

	- 17. Log Your Wins 
	  
	  They can help when you are feeling emotionally down, or when writing a brag document (h/t @b0rk: https://t.co/BOr4Lo8rJL). 
	  
	  Help others celebrate their wins too. 
	  
	  PS: a "Brag Slack Channel" can serve as an OLTP store of personal wins. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385354662467956736))
	- 18. Don't End The Week With Nothing (h/t @patio11)
	  
	  https://t.co/1NqEBP1RXP ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385354853816307722))
	- 19. Pick Up What They Put Down 
	  
	  Guarantee feedback by giving feedback. 
	  
	  https://t.co/LBFySkyich ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385354953468772356))
	- 20. Speak Succinctly! 
	  
	  Trailing sentences and double-barreled questions are hard to understand! 
	  
	  Set the general direction and shut up. If they're off-track, interject. 
	  
	  This is preferable to preempting all conversation paths to show how smart you are 💁‍♂️ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385355207144443904))
	- 21. Optimize for Retention, not Consumption
	  
	  We are the sum total of still-relevant knowledge we still remember. 
	  
	  Not the total of the volume of content we consume.

	- 22. Illustrate Your Point
	  
	  Adding code samples or drawing 2x2's and system diagrams makes your idea much more effective.
	  
	  A picture IS worth a thousand words!
	  
	  https://t.co/mLZbHojyLA ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385356061406756865))
	- 23. Separate Your Identity from Your Work
	  
	  You can learn a lot on the Internet for the low, low price of $YourEgo.
	  
	  (thanks to @kentcdodds for spreading this idea)
	  https://t.co/wqeSxD1v7z ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385356316143616000))
	- 24. Build Tools For Yourself
	  
	  https://t.co/zoXG39VFUz ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385356453272121346))
	- 25. Collect Questions
	  
	  Obsess on collecting good answers and you might be precise but irrelevant.
	  
	  Obsess on collecting good questions and you will be approximately right.

	- 26. Systems > Goals. 
	  
	  "You don't rise to the level of your goals. 
	  
	  You fall to the level of your systems."
	- 27. Play Games You Cannot Win
	  
	  Our world is full of winnable games - #1 of the day, employee of the month https://t.co/xIXewwavoc
	  
	  External motivators destroy our intrinsic drive. Keep your childlike creativity: remove winning, remember how it feels.
	  https://t.co/2GdAxixbHX ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385357436328968192))
	- 28. Use Your Calendar as a Todo List
	  
	  Normal todo lists don't force you to make tradeoffs. 
	  
	  Sequence your work, set limits, and know when to decline or delegate tasks.
	  
	  When time block planning, eat your frog: Put First Things First.
	  
	  https://t.co/KUq5e6hyGJ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385357560790732802))
	- 29. Practice Stoicism. 
	  
	  It'll never stay as great as you want, it's never really as bad as you feel. 
	  
	  This, too, shall pass.

	- 30. Have a Productivity Keystone
	  
	  If you start a day unproductive, you are extremely likely to be unproductive the rest of the day.
	  
	  Instead, start off with something productive that you do every morning, you reinforce that today is going to be productive.

	- 31. Incorporate. 
	  
	  Companies pay expenses before taxes. 
	  
	  People pay taxes before expenses.

	- 32. Stay in the Game
	  
	  Berkshire Hathaway originally had a third partner, Rick Guerin. 
	  
	  He got caught out with margin loans and had to sell out. 
	  
	  Warren and Charlie survived 14 recessions.
	  
	  Stay in the bloody game.

	- 33. Don't Skimp On Your Equipment
	  
	  Spending $10's of thousands of dollars of physiotherapy and pain in future can save you a few hundred dollars on your keyboard and monitor today.

	- 34. Earn White Collar, Spend Blue Collar
	  
	  Don't let expenses rise as fast as income - you probably don't need what you're thinking of buying. 
	  
	  Spend part of your white collar income making up for it's downsides - gym, group classes, personal trainer. https://t.co/ymvRJopjcT ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385359709113249794))
	- 35. The Principle Principle — Turn Lessons To Principles
	  
	  When we have failures or success, we should form principles so we can write them down and learn from/repeat them.
	  
	  It is the only way for past versions of you to communicate lessons to future you. https://t.co/JuNedsbqtK ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1385360052278628358))
