There's a truffle that grows wild in china that is a dead ringer for it, but has like, m like two % of the smell. Doesn't really smell like nothing, but it looks just right. So for a while, ten years ago, 20 years ago, there was this huge surge of truffles being dug in china, shipped to italy or france and then sold as black winter druffles, french black winter truffles, or italian black winter druffles. But they were all chinese. It was illegal, and the numbers were huge. One one dita dealer in italy was caught with forty seven tons of these chinese truffles in their warehouse, like ten years back. So it was a probably significant amount of the black truffles being sold in the world were completely fake. And wr actually these chinese truffles.
