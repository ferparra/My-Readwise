	- 1. https://t.co/gs7ztzZNrb is a self-organizing whiteboard, that can pull out and organize info from multiple sources (emails, note-taking apps, docs). Helpful to summarize lots of content when you're in the brainstorming stage and joting down your ideas all over the place. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheAIgal/status/1612641243032436736))
	- 2. @getMaestroAI Cool tool that creates "skimmable summaries" (love that tagline btw) so you can keep track of what your teammates are working on. Would be super helpful for PMs with large, distributed teams, especially across timezones. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheAIgal/status/1612641880998830081))
	- 3. @Fermat_ws
	   Interesting brainstorming tool to supercharge your team (or solo!) brainstorm sessions. I was impressed with the quality of content generated to keep my brainstorm session going, especially when I started running out of ideas.

	- 4. https://t.co/jIsRrSr0cI is your personal email assistant. Could be great for sales, customer success, customer service roles, where you're responding to tons of emails all day. Not sure I could justify this expense in my current role though. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheAIgal/status/1612643382995599360))
