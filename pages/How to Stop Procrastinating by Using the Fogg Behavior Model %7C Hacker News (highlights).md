	- This is the recipe for [[procrastination]] (according to us):1. Think about a task - "I have to do _____."2. Have an automatic negative reaction     2a. Negative thoughts - "I hate doing this,"...
	  
	     2b Negative feelings - Feeling stressed, afraid,...
	  
	  3. Procrastinate - Do something else to feel better.Procrastination is all about escaping negative emotions.Something makes you feel bad, you do something else to feel better.Feeling better (reduced [[discomfort]]) is the short-term reward engaging in procrastination.That's why procrastination can become addictive and automatic)
	- Pychil claims that procrastination is a weakness of will. For another perspective, check out the book, "Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much" [1], which claims it's not just about will (executive function), but also about tunnel vision and reduced fluid intelligence, all caused by a situation of scarcity--time scarcity in the case of procrastination. And they claim reduced executive function is situational. It's not a fundamental attribute of the procrastinator.
	- Well it is a lot more complicated. There is no "mental #energy reserve", but we do get energized by [[norepinephrine]] in the brain and once it becomes saturated it it loses its effect.A simple technique to reset it is to activate the "sigh reflex". You just breathe in twice at a normal pace and then  slowly exhale through the mouth.Another more powerful reset is to do [[yoga]] nidra for 10-20 minutes. Yoga nidra, once you figure it out, will actually deactivate the prefrontal cortex and simulate sleep. Which has a huge boost for your #cognitive abilities.Both of these techniques will increase [[serotonin]] and [[dopamine]] in the brain which will decrease norepinephrine. Once norepinephrine is no longer saturated you can become energized by it again.
