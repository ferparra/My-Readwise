	- 1/ Why do cost overruns and delays happen? Because incentives are broken. The contractors don't see lower costs and on-time or early delivery as beneficial. They believe they will make less profit just as traditional space contractors did before SpaceX. https://t.co/TLjJ7fuM0H ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trengriffin/status/1425797286689271818))

	- 2/ "If you look at the way things are going right now, we're basically moving to a defense force that's more and more special forces. That's more and more rapid deployment. That's more and more machine learning fighting machine learning." https://t.co/NDeFsI2vht ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trengriffin/status/1425798710743605249))
	- 3/ "I’ve been in the top 5% of my age cohort almost all my adult life in understanding the power of incentives, and yet I’ve always underestimated that power. Never a year passes but I get some surprise that pushes a little further my appreciation of incentive superpower.” Munger ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trengriffin/status/1425799821374328833))
	- 4/ Elon Musk: "As soon as you don’t have any competition, the sense of urgency goes away. And as soon as you make something a cost-plus contract, you’re incenting the contractor to maximize the cost of the program, because they get a percentage.” https://t.co/dpyVDU1QNv ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trengriffin/status/1425807199314448386))
	- 5/ "They never want that gravy train to end,” Musk explained. “They become cost maximizers. And then you have good people engaged in cost maximization, because you just gave them an incentive to do that and told them they’ll get punished if they don’t." https://t.co/QpR6rkcMFz ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/trengriffin/status/1425807884445618182))
