	- We had a great chat with @ness_labs members about learning in public. The main barriers were:
	  
	  (1) Fear of judgement: when you feel like you suck too much & don't want to pain people with your current skills level
	  
	  Example: are you confident enough to learn how to sing in public? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anthilemoon/status/1441372002795732993))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- (2) Imposter syndrome: when you think documenting your learning journey is akin to "stealing" content from course creators
	  
	  Example: are you confident you can add your own spin on what you learn & craft a personal take so it becomes original content? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anthilemoon/status/1441372005542948869))
	- (3) Prolificity vs politeness: when you don't want to contribute to the ambient noise by sharing too much, especially without a strong grasp over the concepts you're studying
	  
	  Example: are you confident enough to post lots of questions on Twitter about what you're learning about? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anthilemoon/status/1441372008026046467))
	- (4) Scale distortion: when you don't bother learning in public because you don't have a big enough audience
	  
	  Example: would you write a detailed walkthrough of something you struggled with if only one person would ever get to read it? What if that person is your future self? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anthilemoon/status/1441372011557580811))
	- As someone who's a big proponent of learning in public, this was fascinating on so many levels. Grateful for the vulnerability in this community üôèüèΩ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anthilemoon/status/1441372013986074627))
