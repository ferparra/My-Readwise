	- Linear algebra gives you mini-spreadsheets for your math equations.
	  We can take a table of data (a matrix) and create updated tables from the original. Itâ€™s the power of a spreadsheet written as an equation.
	- Scale: make all inputs bigger/smaller
	  Skew: make certain inputs bigger/smaller
	  Flip: make inputs negative
	  Rotate: make new coordinates based on old ones (East becomes North, North becomes West, etc.)
	- A funky thought: we can treat the operations matrix as inputs!
	- An operations matrix is similar: commands to modify. Applying one operations matrix to another gives a new operations matrix that applies both transformations, in order.
