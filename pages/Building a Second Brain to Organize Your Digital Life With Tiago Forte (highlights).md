	- How to Capture Less and Store More Relevant Information
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* It is important to be selective with what is stored in a second brain, as overstoring can lead to less value being created., * It is important to be aware of the potential negative impacts of overstoring, such as becoming less able to access and use information.)

	  It's interesting because I've heard you talk before and someone might listen to this and say, oh man, so Tiago is probably sitting there and throughout an entire day, generating 10,000 notes of everything. And I actually feel like you might capture less notes than many people doing this. So how do you decide what is relevant enough or important enough to store? Because like you said, if we're all being exposed to gigabytes of information a day, it could be very easy to take that book you read and store 1000 quotes. It could be very easy to take every post you read and store that, which I think honestly, looking back at my old Evernote, I was scrolling through it, I was like, every time I read an article, I would clip the whole article and I would just save this article to Evernote. And then I just had a database of articles, I didn't know what they were for. And I think I was probably overzealous in my storing of information in an early day where like, oh, that didn't even notice was possible. For some reason, I guess in 2010, maybe I thought the article would be gone in the future. So yeah, how do you decide what is relevant to put in a second brain? Because I guess the storage capacity is infinite. So you could put everything.

	  This is the real issue for the kind of person who is prone to this kind of behavior in the first place. They far more likely are saving far too much. They're digital hoarding. They're doing the digital equivalent of like those hoarding TV shows where you can't even open the front door because there's pizza boxes and just like crap piled in every spare place. What's interesting is in the physical world, there's clear negative impacts like the ones I just mentioned in the digital world, you can actually convince yourself, no, this is good. I'm creating value. I'm a like, I'm acquiring real evergreen assets. You're not you're just like stockpiling a resource that the more you stockpile when it comes to information, the less valuable it is because you can't find anything. What is the point of 1000 terabytes of data if you can't even make use of it? If it's all just a endless sea of stuff. And so most of my techniques and my rules of thumb that I teach people are how to capture less, how to capture less, be more discerning, more picky. Most people don't have a high enough standard. They read something that sounds halfway interesting and they save it. I try to save and this is the end of a long journey. I went through a period of hoarding and I think that's actually probably good. Try to capture all the stuff. See how that goes for you.

	- The Primary Use Cases for a First Brain
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Speaker 1 believes that optimizing one's first brain is important in order to have a more carefree and spontaneous life., * Speaker 2 agrees that optimizing one's first brain can be helpful in achieving this goal, but also sees it as an important part of managing responsibilities in the world.)

	  I guess that's a great tee up for what are the primary use cases for someone to be thinking about for their first brain.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So it's a funny thing because this book is in the self improvement category or business. But you might think, oh, this is about optimizing like, you know, where you use a lot, optimizing productivity efficiency. But I really see it as the exact opposite. When I think about my life, my first brain myself, I want to be ever less optimized over time. I don't want to have any structure. I want to have less and less routine. I want to just follow my curiosity and my passion completely spontaneously with no preconception. But I have responsibilities and things that I have to manage in the world. So it's almost like I spend my time optimizing my second brain, making it this well oiled machine so that my first brain can be almost like a child. I look at my two year old, I'm like, I aspire to be like this kid. He just goes after what he wants and what he loves, like 100% of the time. He's just so carefree, so spontaneous, so enliven, so present. ([Time 0:48:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fc297d75-bec9-4167-9cb6-f9af2fe3ed6e))
