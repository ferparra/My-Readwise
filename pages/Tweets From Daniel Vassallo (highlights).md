	- Planning to work for yourself?
	  
	  Don't build a product.
	  
	  Build a portfolio of small bets.
	  
	  Once you adopt this perspective, it becomes a lot easier to figure out what you should be doing (and not doing). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1393780653494206470))

	- How to build a $1B company:
	  
	  Don't.
	  
	  Extreme success is almost all attributable to randomness. And take a look at all the billionaires: do you really envy their lifestyle? Hell no.
	  
	  Instead, build a lifestyle based on your true preferences. A lot cheaper & more likely to realize. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1395932810959986690))
	- But, for you as an individual, asymmetric bets are not enough. Because if you can't fit enough repetitions in your life to have a reasonable chance of materializing a payoff in your lifetime, then the upside doesn't really matter.

	- If you put 10,000 hours into woodworking, you'll almost certainly become good at woodworking.
	  
	  If you put 10,000 hours into your business, it doesn’t necessarily translate to a successful business!
	  
	  The first kind has a predictable relationship to effort. The second kind doesn’t. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1398728680382238720))
	- Good reasons to do things yourself:
	  
	  1. Usually better quality than hiring someone*
	  2. Higher satisfaction
	  3. Adds sentimental value
	  4. Gain of self-sufficiency skills
	  5. Saves money
	  
	  * most pros are pros in efficiency not necessarily in quality ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1408706663515889665))
	- Passive income is against our nature as a hunter-gatherers species. We evolved fitness for an environment where putting food on the table is a constant stressor on our mind & body. Without that stressor, a part of us atrophies away, and it makes us insane. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1410528370622877698))
	- Want to work for yourself? Consider creating a portfolio of educational info products:
	- Living requires some optionality. A full-time job takes away most of it — regardless of how much you like it.
	  
	  It's sunny outside, and you'd like to spend some time with your kids? Sorry, that job you love cannot wait. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1444450768812052483))

	- What makes us trust a pilot that he or she will fly us safely to our destination?
	  
	  Two things
	  
	  1) The airline's (presumably) high hiring bar
	  2) The fact that the pilot is there in the plane with us
	  
	  #2 is underrated. In business, you also need some exposure to risk to be trusted. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1613967874040950784))
