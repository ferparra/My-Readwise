	- THE POWER OF DEAD HANGS: 
	  
	  Hanging from an overhead bar has become popular for improving shoulder health

	- The shoulder is a ball and socket joint
	  
	  the less space there is in the joint, the worse the shoulders tend to function
	  
	  Rotator cuff tears, shoulder impingement, frozen shoulders, these things happen when the humerus becomes compressed and starts compressing the rotator cuff

	- Dr. John Kirsch, an Orthopedic surgeon and shoulder specialist, discovered the power of dead hangs when he himself experienced shoulder pain
	  
	  he cured his pain, but he didnt know WHY this worked
	  
	  So he did research
	  
	  What he discovered was a new JOINT position in the shoulder....

	- he deemed this joint the Acromiohumeral joint. It leads to a major insight
	  
	  The shoulder is not a weight bearing joint, but it is weighted SUSPENDING 
	  
	  by hanging, the humerus is tractioned upward, and this suspension creates SPACE between the humerus and Acromion ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AJA_Cortes/status/1523321928399863808))
	- This daily hanging/tractioning restores the joint space and joint capsule 
	  
	  And it remodels the acromion

	- Dr. Kirsch did a case study on 92 patients (majority had been diagnosed with shoulder impingement), having all of them dead hang  daily
	  
	  The improvement in shoulder pathology was extraordinary, 90 of them experienced significant reductions in pain & improvements in daily function ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AJA_Cortes/status/1523324312496791558))
	- So we can agree that hanging is a powerful and FREE intervention for alleviating shoulder pain & strengthening the shoulders
	  
	  How long do you do it for? 
	  
	  Bob and Brad have an excellent video on it
