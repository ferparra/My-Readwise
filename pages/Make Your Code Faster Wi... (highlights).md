	- Make your code faster with Bloom filters. They are like HashMaps but smaller and allow you to short-circuit more expensive operations.

	- Imagine you have to do an expensive search operation for a KEY. You also know the most likely outcome is that the KEY will not be found. Such operations can‚Äôt be skipped on the off chance that the KEY is found.
	  
	  A bloom filter allows you to skip such work

	- A bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that can answer if a key is NOT present.
	  
	  bloomFilter.test(KEY):
	- Bloom filters use a hash() to convert KEY -> number.
	  
	  The number is then modulo bit array size and used to set a bit in bit-array.
	  
	  NOTE: we are talking bits => 1 byte = 8 bits => memory efficient

	- To test() if a KEY is present
	  
	  bits[hash(KEY)%bits.length]
	  
	  If a bit present, it could be our KEY, OR it could be a collision. So we are not sure.
	  If a bit is NOT present, then we are 100% sure that KEY can not be there.
