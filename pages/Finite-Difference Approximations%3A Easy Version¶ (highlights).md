	- The simplest way to check a derivative is to recall that the definition of a differential:
	  
	  df=f(x+dx)−f(x)=f′(x)dxdf=f(x+dx)−f(x)=f′(x)dx
	  
	  df = f(x+dx) - f(x) = f'(x) dx came from dropping higher-order terms from a small but finite difference:
	  
	  δf=f(x+δx)−f(x)=f′(x)δx+o(‖δx‖) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn3zm4qm9rq7pyrd3rye3z15))
