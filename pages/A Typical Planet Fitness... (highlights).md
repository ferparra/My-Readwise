- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Jan 30th, 2023]]
	- A typical Planet Fitness has 7,500 members, of which only ~10% show up on a given day.
	  
	  In fact, the large majority of their 17,000,000 members worldwide rarely go to the gym.
	  
	  The genius behind the Planet Fitness franchise model:

	- Founded in 1992, Planet Fitness has had a differentiated marketing approach from day 1.
	  
	  Rather than trying to attract fitness enthusiasts, their core customer is the ~80% of the US population that doesn't belong to a gym.
	  
	  This makes their total addressable market *massive*

	- To maximize conversion, Planet Fitness optimizes everything around lowering the 2 biggest obstacles for non-gym members:
	  
	  1. Price
	  2. Intimidation
	  
	  Here's how they execute on both: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/franchisewolf/status/1619689364690436098))
	- PRICE -
	  
	  With an entry membership of $10/month, it's the most affordable gym on the planet.
	  
	  Compared to boutique fitness franchises like OrangeTheory that can cost over $200/month...
	  
	  Planet Fitness is clearly priced for the beginner.

	- INTIMIDATION -
	  
	  Planet Fitness does all they can to help members feel welcome.
	  
	  Each gym has a "lunk alarm" that goes off if someone grunts too loud, and purposely lacks equipment like bench presses to avoid attracting 'meat heads'.
	  
	  It truly is "home of the judgement free zone"

	- Just this month, Planet Fitness had a marketing spat with Equinox over New Year's resolutions.
	  
	  While it's clear Planet Fitness has remained committed to those who feel "Gymtimidation", the X-factor behind their success lies in their franchise model...

	- The avg Planet Fitness earns ~$1,600,000 in revenue, of which, Planet Fitness Corporate takes a:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ 7% royalty i.e. $112K per each of the 2,200 franchises
	  ‚Ä¢ 2% fee for national marketing i.e. $32,000 per location
	  
	  More locations = more recurring rev + a bigger marketing budget!

	- But with each gym that opens, Planet Fitness is ALSO becoming one of the biggest fitness equipment distributors worldwide.
	  
	  How?
	  
	  Because every franchisee is required to purchase the purple equipment directly from Planet Fitness Corporate...

	- In 2021, Planet Fitness Corporate sold ~$140 million worth of equipment to franchisees.
	  
	  So not only do they have a 9-figure recurring revenue royalty stream, they also have a 9-figure equipment business.
	  
	  Oh and btw, franchisees need to upgrade that equipment every 5-7 years...

	- Given the size of their potential customer base, and their expert use of the franchise model -
	  
	  It's no wonder Planet Fitness has ~2,300+ locations worldwide, and is worth over $7 billion dollars üí∞
