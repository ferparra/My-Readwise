	- Shaping — the pre-work we do on projects before we consider them ready to schedule.
	- Betting — how we choose among the pitched projects and decide what to do six weeks at a time.
	- Building — the expectations we place on the teams and the special practices they use to discover what to do.
	- When we shape the work, we need to do it at the right level of abstraction: not too vague and not too concrete. Product managers often err on one of these two extremes.
	- When design leaders go straight to wireframes or high-fidelity mockups, they define too much detail too early. This leaves designers no room for creativity.
