	- Lesson design üßµ
	  
	  Every lesson comes from experience, and every experience offers up its own lessons.
	  
	  How do we design experiences so that students...
	  
	  1) Internalize the core, intended lesson(s)
	  2) Do not internalize lesson(s) that make learning harder in the future
	  
	  Off we go! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jfarmer/status/1384631029491666944))
	- One overarching principle: on balance, our minds are desperate to make sense of new experiences.
	  
	  If we can make sense with our current understanding, we'll (usually) do it without noticing. We won't realize there's something *to* notice until we hit a genuine impasse. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jfarmer/status/1384631037305753611))
	- Enter "impasse-driven learning," a term coined by Kurt VanLehn at ASU (AFAIK).
	  
	  Impasses require intentional reflection to overcome. We can ask:
	  
	  ¬∑ Which impasses are worthwhile?
	  ¬∑ How do we create those impasses?
	  ¬∑ How do we ensure students resolve impasses effectively? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jfarmer/status/1384631039004487682))
	- Not all impasses are worthwhile. We could make every sentence an impasse by only using Pig Latin.
	  
	  Instead, ask yourself: ‚ÄúHow will students feel after overcoming this impasse?‚Äù
	  
	  Students should experience a genuine moment of insight, accomplishment, or transformation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jfarmer/status/1384631045501464576))
	- How do we create worthwhile impasses?
	  
	  One way is to look at whatever impasse motivated people to invent a particular concept, tool, or technique in the first place!
	  
	  Re-create that impasse‚Äîscoped to students' current understanding‚Äîand have them attempt to resolve it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jfarmer/status/1384631047355346944))
	- For example, say you want to teach React. Your students know basic HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.
	  
	  Have students build a few sites w/ jQuery, complex enough to create jQuery soup. Next, rebuild those sites w/ React.
	  
	  After that, React will feel like the most natural thing in the world! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jfarmer/status/1384631049456603137))
	- This might seem much slower, but done well, it winds up being much faster over the long run. This is because well-designed impasses:
	  
	  1. Shorten the time to accurate internalization, even if the initial lesson starts later
	  2. Accelerate the future rate of learning ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jfarmer/status/1384631051050434564))
	- The thread is already long enough, so I won't get into how to ensure students resolve impasses effectively right now. Hopefully, this was helpful!
	  
	  In your field, what are some impasses you know students need to overcome? What impasses have defined how your field evolved? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jfarmer/status/1384631057895628810))
