	- I get work done using my Hub and Subsystems approach, built in Tana (@tana_inc). 
	  
	  Workflows in Tana are flexible and powerful, but building supertag structures can be mindbending.
	  
	  Here's how I "un-bent" my mind while designing my Task Management Hub in Tana...

	- I used diagrams to visualize three different perspectives on the workflow:
	  
	  1. What does it DO? (Practical Diagram)
	  
	  2. How do its functions relate? (Functional Diagram)
	  
	  3. What structures (supertags) and information (fields) will I need? (Structural Diagram) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rjnestor/status/1608590716581851137))
	- Having the workflow laid out where I can see it, from different perspectives, helps me avoid getting twisted into mental knots.
	  
	  Here's how I built those three diagrams for my Task Management Hub:
	  
	  (I used @obsdmd's new Canvas feature for these visuals.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rjnestor/status/1608590718255394818))
	- This is the Practical Diagram. What do I want the Task Management hub to do?
	  
	  ✅ Store potential work in various forms
	  
	  ✅ Allow me to plan work for the day or week ahead
	  
	  ✅ Help me COMPLETE work
	  
	  This simple diagram helps me get the basics situated.

	- This is the Functional Diagram. It's a lot more layered than the Practical Diagram. "Completed Work" has become the "Now Lists"—an Agenda turning into a Log as it passes through Now.
	  
	  Storing, scheduling, recurrence, and surfacing are more detailed and explicit.

	- Here's the Structural Diagram, which converts the Functional Diagram into a Tana-specific implementation.
	  
	  I use this back and forth with actual building in Tana (@tana_inc) to make sure my thinking stays clear and the workflow functions the way I need it to.

	- If you take my Tana for Tasks course (https://t.co/p55TUrTDxY), you'll never need to build a Task Management hub yourself.
	  
	  However, the process of building ANY workflow in Tana is similar. When your mind feels bent, use diagrams!
	  
	  My AP Productivity Cohort Seven can help... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rjnestor/status/1608590734449418242))
	- In AP Productivity Cohort Seven, we'll Diagram and Deploy the workflows YOU need.
	  
	  We'll spend 6 weeks from January 13 to February 24 building your custom productivity system in @tana_inc.
