	- Deleuze is noteworthy for his rejection of the Heideggerian notion of the “end of metaphysics.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkwwj4k2kgvs0ccr5agnx44c))
	- First, [[Kant]] made the field of consciousness immanent *to* a transcendental subject, thereby reintroducing an element of identity that is transcendent (that is, external) to the field itself, and reserving all power of synthesis (that is, identity-formation) in the field to the activity of the always already unified and transcendent subject. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkwwk9270jnhtmpceq1rdy6y))
	- Deleuze had pointed to an empiricist reversal of Kant. Where Kant’s question had been “How can the given be given to a subject?” Hume’s question had been “How is the subject (human nature) constituted within the given?” In his mature work, Deleuze argues for an “impersonal and pre-individual” transcendental field in which the subject as identity pole which produces empirical identities by active synthesis is itself the result or product of differential *passive syntheses* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkwww279dhgwztdx868nwy8f))
	- Deleuze’s second criticism of Kant claims that he had simply presumed the existence of knowledge and morality as “facts” and then sought their conditions of possibility in the transcendental. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkwwksmq09mrx9pywmytmj2j))
	- Propositions, in other words, can be related either to the objects to which they refer, or to the subjects who utter them, or to other propositions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkwwxwb6yve1vykmnf87beft))
