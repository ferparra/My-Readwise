	- The Importance of Changing How Work Gets Done at Scale
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Big companies can benefit from reducing layers of decision making and implementing agile methods to speed up processes., * This journey can be difficult, but it is worth it if companies want to improve their efficiency.)

	  Speaker 1
	  I mean, it kind of dawned on me that when you're that big, it's a really valuable lesson. And it taught me the how's, perhaps more important than the what. Because if I didn't do something to change how work was done, like change those processes or give them new tools, help them with skills, they couldn't. They'll just do the same thing faster. If someone tells you you got hiking boots and they're like, no, go run a marathon. You're like, I can't do it in those boots. But so you've got to do something. And at first, I think the way is for big companies, I have a phone call and I'm like blunt clubs. You do what everyone does. You reduce layers. Because if you reduce layers, decisions go faster. There's just, it's math. If there's less decision points, things go faster. You do the blunt club thing. And then after that though, it did lead me down a, a long journey of they sound like buzzwords, but if you really do them at scale, they're hard around things like agile. And because you really got to change the way work gets done. And we ended up training, God, hundreds of thousands of people on that stuff. I hardly do that. Correctly. And how to do it correctly. That's right. Because everybody talks about it. But the idea that you would really have small, multi-disciplinary teams work from the outside in, set those sort of interim steps, take the feedback pivot and then do it on, not just products, do it on lots of things.

	- The Art of Making Hard Unpopular Decisions
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* The author believes that flattening organizations and reducing the number of layers of management leads to faster decisionmaking and increased autonomy for employees., * The author has had to make unpopular decisions in the past, as any leader who leads a company that is meant to endure for a century will.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  The blunt club thing you're talking about. So flatten organizations as much as possible. Yeah, yeah, I probably reduce the layers of management by half. And so that has lots of benefits, right? Time to a decision, more autonomy to people. Because, and then the idea of like faster clarity of where you're going, because you're not just filtered through so many different layers. And I think it's the kind of thing, a lot of companies, if you're big, have to just keep going through. It's kind of like grass grows, you know? It just comes back and you kind of go back town and work on it. So it's a natural thing. But I hear so many people talk about it, like this idea of like, okay, who makes a decision? You've often heard nobody can say yes, and everybody can say no. And that's actually what you're trying to get out of a system like that.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So, I mean, your book in general, the way you lead is very much about we and us, you know, the power of we. But is there times when a leader has to step in and be almost autocratic, take control and make hard unpopular decisions? Oh, I am sure you know the answer to that.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  And it is of course, yes.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  It's just fun to hear you say. Fun to sit, yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  You know, because I actually, a, there's a leader for a time, but then there's a leader for a situation, right? And so, I've had to do plenty of unpopular things. I think anytime you have to run a company that endures a century and has to endure another century, you will do unpopular things.

	- The Importance of Being Careful with Your Roles as a Role Model
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* G believes that everyone should have access to power, regardless of their motives., * G is careful to use power for good, rather than for personal gain.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  I enjoyed it. So I'll be the first. And I'm really careful to say that to people because I don't think everyone should associate G to do what you did. You have to, there's only one route there, right? And that's just not true. And I do it because I like it. In fact, I'm careful. And as time goes on, you have to be careful. There's more and more people will watch you. Whether you like it, you're a role model or not. You are a role model for people. Whether you know it, like it, want it, does not matter. I learned that the hard way. And I would have to say people, hey, just because I do this, does not mean I do it for these reasons, right? It's going to be really explicit. And I'd come to believe usually when people say the word power, I don't know, do you have a positive or negative notion when I say the word power? We'll just do it. I'm probably negative on, yeah. For some stereotype or some view that somebody's abused it in some way, you can read the newspaper, somebody's doing something. Personal people, like I'll ask people, do you want power? And they're like, oh, no, I'd rather do good. And I think the irony is you need power to do good. And so that sort of led me down to, as I thought about my own life, right?

	- The Power of Adversity
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Taking care of yourself is important for success., * Adversity teaches you to be resilient., * It's important to have mentors or parents who can help you through difficult times.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  The being able to take care of yourself is that, I mean, practically, do you mean just a self belief that I'll figure it out?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I'll figure it out and practically both, right?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So you wrote, quote, I vividly remember the last two weeks of my freshman year when I only had 25 cents left. I put the quarter in a clear plastic box on my desk and just stared at it. This is it, I thought. No more money. So do you think there's some aspect of that financial stress, even desperation, just being hungry?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Do that play a role in that drive that led to your success to be the CEO of one of the great companies ever? It's a really interesting question because I was just talking to another colleague who's CEO of another great American company this weekend. And he mentioned to me about all this adversity. And he said, all right, I said to him, I said, do you think part of your success is because you had bad stuff happen? And he said yes, and so I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say, I don't think you have to have tragedy. But it does teach you one really important thing is that there is always a way forward, always, and it's in your control.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I think there's probably wisdom for mentorship there, or whether you're a parent or a mentor, that easy times don't result in growth. ([Time 0:32:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5e9d0421-d052-4a73-8a2d-70672e6bca27))
	- The Art of Navigating Tension: A Guide to Good Power
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Good power is doing something hard or meaningful, but in a positive way., * To embrace and navigate tension, you have to be willing to bridge divides that unites people.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  Uh, let's, if it's okay, just zoom out to, uh, you mentioned, uh, power and good power a few times. So if we can just even talk about it here, your book is called Good Power, Leading Positive Change in Our Lives, Working World. What is good power? What's the essence of good power?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So the essence of it would be doing something hard or meaningful, but in a positive way. I would also tell you, I hope one day I'm remembered for how I did things, not just for what I did. I think that could almost be more important. And I think it's a choice we can all make. So the essence to me of good power, if I had a contrast, good to bad, let's say, would be that first off, you have to embrace and navigate tension. This is the world we live in. And by embracing tension, not running from it, you would bridge divides that unites people, not divides them. It's a hard thing to do, but you can do it. You do it with respect, which is the opposite of fear. ([Time 0:39:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2dc03f31-4a52-46ba-80d6-f7e3a5e812ec))
