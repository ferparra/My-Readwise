	- [[nondualism]], also called non-duality, means "not two" or "one undivided without a second".[1][2] Nondualism primarily refers to a mature state of [[consciousness]], in which the dichotomy of I-other is "transcended", and awareness is described as "centerless" and "without dichotomies"
	- An ocean is that one seer, without any duality [Advaita]; this is the Brahma-world, O King. Thus did Yajnavalkya teach him. This is his highest goal, this is his highest success, this is his highest world, this is his highest bliss. All other creatures live on a small portion of that bliss.— Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.3.32, [11][12][13]
	- The negation of dualistic thinking in pairs of opposites. The Yin-Yang symbol of Taoism symbolises the transcendence of this dualistic way of thinking
	- Monism, the nonplurality of the world. Although the phenomenal world appears as a plurality of "things", in reality they are "of a single cloth"
	- Advaita, the nondifference of subject and object, or nonduality between subject and object.
	- Advaya, the identity of phenomena and the Absolute, the "nonduality of duality and nonduality",[web 1] c.q. the nonduality of relative and ultimate truth as found in Madhyamaka Buddhism and the two truths doctrine.
	- Mysticism, a mystical unity between God and man.
