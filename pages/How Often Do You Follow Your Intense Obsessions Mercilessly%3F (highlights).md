	- Argentine Olympic sailor and a naval architect Santiago Lange demonstrated a high level of obsession with his pursuit of Olympic goal. At 54 years-of-age, Lange had to overcome cancer and the loss of half a lung to win Olympic gold in sailing at Rio 2016. Lange’s obsession to win gold helped him recover from cancer. Reflecting upon his life Lange said “When I look back it was a good experience, difficult, but I learned a lot. I was operated on in Barcelona and after five days I was cycling; in a month I was back sailing. This may help to give strength to many people who are going through what I've been through. I became obsessed with getting to Rio very well prepared and we did."
