	- **Moods that are conducive to learning (29) - wonder, perplexity, serenity/acceptance, patience, ambition, resolution, confidence, trust**
	  
	  1.  Learning to shift from unproductive to productive moods is a critical aspect of learning to learn. As we learn to become aware of our moods, and are able to observe ourselves in a negative mood that blocks us from achieving what we want to achieve, such as resignation, we can choose not to remain hostages to this mood, and take action to cultivate an alternative mood that is more conducive to achieving what we set out to achieve (reflect on your learning objectives and why that gives you energy) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw3crxv61g1yytc0cee6kvm))
		- **Note**: Learning to shift from unproductive to productive moods is an essential part of learning to learn. By being mindful of our moods, we can recognize when a negative mood such as resignation is preventing us from our goals. We can then choose to cultivate a more productive mood, such as wonder, perplexity, serenity/acceptance, patience, ambition, resolution, confidence, or trust, which will help us to reach our learning objectives and give us the energy we need to succeed.
	- Dreyfus Skill Acquisition model
	  
	  1.  Beginner - advanced beginner - competent - proficient - expert - master
	    1.  **A master reinvents the rules; generates new discourses and disciplines from anomalies in the domain. A master is willing to override the perspective that they intuitively experience and choose a new one for the sake of learning and contributing to their field. A master is willing to regress to earlier stages in the learning scale for the sake of taking risks and learning**
	    2.  Masters deal with wonder, resolution, ambition and need to concern themselves with arrogance and resignation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw3d6s483cadj0wjbzkkc4p))
		- **Note**: The Dreyfus Skill Acquisition model outlines five stages of learning, from beginner to master. A master is willing to take risks to learn and contribute to their field, and is willing to regress to earlier stages in the process. They must also be mindful of the emotions of wonder, resolution, ambition, arrogance, and resignation.
	- Trust = combination of sincerity, competence, reliability, engagement/care ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw3dj53751cf8dxbz6jdzj2))
	- Galilean Relativity
	  
	  1.  Easterners perceive things holistically, viewing objects as they are related to each other or in a context, whereas Westerners perceive them analytically in isolation; Easterners use wide-angle lens; Westerners use a narrow one with a sharper focus. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw3dmkhryeq1t20rknbrzqz))
		- **Note**: Galilean Relativity means that Easterners and Westerners see things differently. Easterners see things as part of a bigger picture, looking at how things are connected and in what context. Westerners look at things one at a time, focusing on the details. Easterners view things like a camera with a wide-angle lens, and Westerners view things like a camera with a narrow lens that zooms in.
