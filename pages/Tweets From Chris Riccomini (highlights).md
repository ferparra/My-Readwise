	- I've been thinking of a survey post on modern/next-gen analytics, including:
	  
	  * Headless BI
	  * Analytics Engineering (DBT 'n stuff)
	  * Data Mesh (I know..)
	  * Reverse ETL
	  * White-label data viz (a la @TopcoatData)
	  
	  What else should I cover? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/criccomini/status/1451557884769169412))
	- ðŸ‘‹ The project I've been working on is now open source!
	  
	  Open Robo-Advisor is a Python library that acts as an advisor ðŸ¤– for passive indexing (think Wealthfront). It's very basic, but I wanted to get it out early.
	  
	  Check it out and send feedback! ðŸ‘€
