	- LangChain is one of the coolest things I’ve seen in programming in a while
	  
	  It’s a toolkit for building “agents” on top of ChatGPT et al. 
	  
	  If you’re a programmer, you should probably drop what you’re doing and check it out ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dotta/status/1640475815488913412))

	- @LangChainAI fwiw

	- One of the surprising things about LLMs is that they’re incredibly good at chaining reasoning if they’re allowed to think out loud

	- But it’s not limited to OpenAIs models. You can write adapters for any LLM and hook them into local data sources, search engines, scripting languages ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dotta/status/1640476222672052227))
