	- Violence now finds its expression in positivities, in destructive or exploitative self-assertions that position us against ourselves.
	- Disciplinary societies are not effective at adapting to the flow of capital. They drill us into rigid patterns of living that cannot be easily changed - hence the tendency of global society towards the abolition of borders, walls, taboos, prohibitions, tariffs, punishments, and moral codes.
	- The traumas of the achievement-subject are not those of the Freudian age, where we repressed our desires out of a sense of social duty, compulsively washed our hands, and dreamt about our mothers. No, the manias of our age are depression, exhaustion, and burnout.
	- The word Sabbath originally meant “stopping”, which presupposes “starting”. Both are needed, but modern society has disrupted the “stopping”. In doing so, it has destroyed those moments in which we might contemplate.
	- The depressive is not passive, but hyper-active, and lacks composure.
