	- a calmer, deeper metamodern attitude, one that can draw on both contemplative and performative modes of being, and access a wider range of tempos of engagement of reality, is possible.
	- So personal metamodern paradigms foster agent-y dispositions as the Rowson quote earlier suggests. They get you viewing the world in a way that does not render you helpless and inactive. You get to do things! You are powerful!
	- the cost is that thoughtfully considered relevance can degenerate into unconscious hypersensitivity to mere salience.
