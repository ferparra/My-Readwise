	- Creation is about more than just money.
	  
	  It's about self sufficiency. Self actualization. Playing long term games. Collecting optionality.
	  
	  It's about having a job while not *BEING* your job.

	- A GraphQL CDN is one of those “in retrospect, it’s obvious” ideas 😍
	  
	  Difficulty of caching, security, and performance at scale is on every single list of GraphQL downsides, they can solve this in one fell swoop..
	  
	  You have to wonder why no one else was working on this before! https://t.co/bBA1vlqv83 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1405520218194075648))
	- My take on Why @TailwindCSS:
	  
	  https://t.co/Rj1B6Xk5mM
	  
	  Probably obvious to experts, but it's the top organic Google result for "Why Tailwind" now. I think more people should write straightforward "Why X" or "What is X" posts. You don't always have to write earthshattering theses. https://t.co/SJjWpgauGL

	- One of the most underrated skills for engineers is finding a “minimum spanning stack” that they know inside out, and not constantly jumping to the new hotness.
	  
	  Having opinions about every new thing is an antipattern.
	  
	  Embrace hammers so you can nail everything else.

	- As far as I can tell no major bootcamp survived.
	  
	  DBC -> Kaplan
	  Fullstack -> Bridgepoint
	  Hack Reactor -> Galvanize
	  Galvanize -> K12
	  Hackbright -> Capella
	  Flatiron -> WeWork
	  General Assembly -> Adecco
	  Lambda -> Bloom
	  
	  Lots of sizzle about "unlocking human potential".
	  
	  No steak. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1542659132259414016))

	  I don't know what the next great AI product *is*, but I know what questions it will answer.
