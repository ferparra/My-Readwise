	  So I would say unequivocally yes. Okay, appreciate that. And the reason for that is that singing is not always about what comes out, but where it's coming from. So if the sound that comes out of your mouth came from joy in your heart, then you're already a success. Thank you. I'm gonna form a band with your dad. It's gonna be rough for the rest of us.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  We're just gonna do it. It's do it all the time. My poor dad. Other than me and your dad singing, hardest thing about your job. Hardest thing about being a laryngologist, anything. Flora is yours.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I would say the hardest things about being a laryngologist include sometimes having to tell people they have cancer. Fuck. Yeah. And having a surgical non-success for getting out one of those airway tubes and just having to tell them flat out what we tried didn't work. And I'm sorry. And not so hard, but occasionally hard, is that sometimes medicine is one of these things where you walk into a room with a stranger and they ask you a bunch of personal questions. And then some of my patients, they tell me really, really bad truths like about their life or their situation and to be able to balance my human heart and give them encouragement and also do the medical diagnostic work I have to do because sometimes I just wanna go down the rabbit hole with them, you know? Like whether it's, oh, I'm here because I survived an abusive situation and I did have an injury to my voice box and what can we do to make it better? All the way to, like, oh, I'm back. I'm trying to stop smoking, but I'm just out from incarceration, but I've got this great job and for me to be able to be present and encouraging and neutral in their lives and be like, well, thank you for sharing that. You know, that's not something you can share with everyone and I thank you for trusting me with your truth. It's a real responsibility to be authentically here and present with patients so they can tell us the truth and we can get to the root of the matter. So it's sometimes hard, but it's also a privilege to be just that trusted. It can be tough, but we're trying to show up for our patients as real people. So sometimes your doc is having a bad day. Sometimes you're having a bad day. So we want to offer our patient's grace and we hope that you can offer us grace as well. And, you know, I think sometimes people don't always remember that we may have just come from a room where we gave super, super discouraging news to someone and then we're coming to something that's either good or mildly frustrating and we work really hard internally to meet you, where you are, because for you, whatever we're talking about is serious and it doesn't really matter for that encounter that what I just came from, but your doctor is a person. And so they have to make that transition. So I hope sometimes if we're like five, 10, or even 40 minutes late, that people can understand that sometimes the person with cancer is 20 minute appointment was not appropriate and I have to stay with them until we get through what they need to get through so that I can go in and tell you, no, you don't need a tonsillectomy.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, yeah, that's such a good perspective to give people, especially as people who have recently lost people, you know what those appointments are like. Oh, yeah. And, you know, so thankful for the other patients who did wait while I was in a room with my dad, you know? I'm sure you know that too. What about your favorite thing? What is it that just gets you out of bed? ([TimeÂ 0:54:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b0fd5e15-0d41-4a6f-befa-dca6c5914697))
