	  I was going to save these questions for later, but s ing as good a time as any to get into them. Or ond strategy, which your book is about, i outsays the fact that people just build feature, features, features, and generally have a strategy or are using a strategy. And so just spending a little time there, what are signs that your team or your company either doesn't have a strategy or aren't using their strategy?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yes, thats got question. Ines that there are no strategy. Teams are all working like dogs, like they're they're working 80 hours weeks. I see this all the time. People are heads down, crunch and crunch and crunching, releasing, releasing, releasing, or sometimes not releasing. But they're working like crazy, and none of the metricks are moving. So the executive team is going, what is happening? Product is a black box. ([Time 0:21:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/91663283-de86-40a4-8643-481efe2d5a69))
	- What's Your Advice For Chief Product Officers?
	  
	  Summary:
	  If you want to get better at strategy, talk to people who really understand the market and financials. I'd go talk to your chief product officer, if you have one, and just ask them what's their process? How did you set this ritly? We got to these three priorities, or something like that. Just having conversations with people about what their thought process is,. how they analyzed it, what that means.

	  I was just talking to one of the chief product officers w who graduated from my programme last year. Now she's the scipio of a company, and i said, what was your advice for especially people woere not chief product officers yet, or i sees, cause i hear from a lot of people, you know, i'm not given the opportunity to work on strategy. And i loved her advice because she said, you know, even when i didn't have that role or responsibility or that scope, i sat there and i still imagined what i would do if i was in their possision. That's powerful, you know, pretending to see pie. Would you do something different? What would you do? Can you dig into the data? Can you ask questions? Can you get into there? I'm not saying, like, go re invent the wheel for the company, but it's going to give you reps, right? It's going to give you the experience asking those questions. So i think that's powerful, picturing what what you would do. Her scenario, if you want to get better at strategy, talk to people who really understand the market, really understand the financials. I'd go talk to your chief product officer, if you have one, and just ask them, like, what's your process? How did you set this ritly? We got to these three priorities, or something like, how'd you get there? Whoud you look at i think that's important, just having conversations with people about what their thought process is, how they analyzed it, what that means. I think that's really important when you get into setting strategy at higher levels for product, a lot of it has to do with the market and the customers and the financials and the things that we don't get exposed to as much as, you know, as a team level product manager.
