	  I'll be pinning this detailed timeline, as my final piece covering this topic, as now the case is closed in my mind.
	  
	  This was a crime plain and simple and I'll put no more wind in this criminals sails:
	  
	  FTX: Meltdown.
	  
	  The definitive and chronological thread. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020859156865026))

	  Sept 30th, 2022:
	  
	  On September 30th, I noticed an odd behavior, that while other exchanges were declining in their Ethereum "open interest" (amount of futures contracts bought on leverage)
	  
	  FTX was not.
	  
	  It was at an all time high: https://t.co/5cyj53rTZY ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020861874769921))
	- 3/82
	  
	  At the time, we didn't know why.
	  
	  We'd later learn that the FTX<>Alameda relationship had for years misused customer funds illegally, and set up their systems in a way to maximize every dollar for their own benefit. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020864638767105))
	- 4/82
	  
	  We had learned over the Summer that FTX had been using their $FTT and $SRM tokens to get large loans from centralized lenders like BlockFi and Celsius, often selling the assets they borrowed, distressing the markets and then buying out these distressed lenders.

	- 5/82
	  
	  So what is the problem with these tokens?
	  
	  They are primarily controlled by Alameda, with a low circulating supply.
	  
	  It would be as if you sold one single strand of your hair for $100, and now claimed that the rest of all our hair was worth $1T in collateral. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020874675744769))
	- 6/82
	  
	  But, the market assumed that these games stopped with simply bad lenders making deals they shouldn't have.
	  
	  We were wrong.
	  
	  In early October SBF began to quietly lobby the US congress for the DCCPA bill:

	- 7/82
	  
	  This bill would effectively ban decentralized finance, and force consumers to use centralized products like FTX.
	  
	  There was a pattern emerging here that none of us saw at the time.
	  
	  An obvious thread in hindsight, where everything was about putting more assets in FTX. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020880203894784))
	- 8/82
	  
	  We later learned than whenever FTX/Alameda invested in an entity, they often told the projects to use the FTX exchange as their bank account/keep their assets on the exchange, as a part of the deal term.
	  
	  This DCCPA bill was the same mantra, more assets on the exchange ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020882720432129))
	- 9/82
	  
	  October 19th:
	  
	  Near the end of October, lawyer @lex_node managed to get and release a copy of the DCCPA bill that had been floated around Washington as a draft.
	  
	  The community, seeing that it would result in banning DeFi expressed their outrage towards Sam. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020885245403136))
	- 10/82
	  
	  Over the coming days, Sam was erratic, aggressive and insulting to just about everyone.
	  
	  It's also where he made his now infamous jab at Binance CEO CZ about not traveling to DC.

	- 11/82
	  
	  To this day, Sam wrongly claims that this led to CZ attacking the value of their token and collapsing their exchange. (But more on that soon)
	  
	  The flippant tone of SBF struck the community as odd. It seemed like something was clearly wrong behind the scenes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020893633970176))
	- 12/82
	  
	  November 2nd:
	  
	  On November 2nd, Coindesk then published an overview of Alameda's assets, which suggested that Alameda could be insolvent:
	  
	  https://t.co/LnUcq9FhIM ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020896129662976))
	- 13/82
	  
	  Rather than respond to these posts, Sam continued with business as usual, even his new and sudden tradition of posting a teaser of the weekly $FTT buy backs each week, trying to raise the value of the token: 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FhuMEPxUcAAgg6Z.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020902655959040))
	- 14/82
	  
	  We learned then, that Alameda had over $8b of loans on their books, that was primarily backed by their $FTT token - something that no sophisticated lending desk (the type that would have $8b to spare) would ever allow.
	  
	  Except perhaps FTX... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020905642262528))
	- 15/82
	  
	  This is when we became alarmed.
	  
	  You see unlike a bank, a crypto exchange isn't authorized to simply lend all your assets, unless its outlined in their terms of service, or unless you opt-in to a specific lending product. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020908196663296))
	- 16/82
	  
	  FTX's terms of service expressly require that you retain title to your assets, which means, if they use them for any purpose other than what you direct them to, it's legally theft.

	- 17/82
	  
	  But, FTX's opt in lending market only showed around $2.8B in peer-to-peer authorized lending.
	  
	  Something that wouldn't make up the total number required to lend to Alameda.

	- 18/82
	  
	  FTX also had an "Earn" program through the old Blockfolio app but it was later confirmed by head of sales @tackettzane that (at least as far as FTX employees were told) these funds came from marketing dollars and not lending.

	- 19/82
	  
	  Since historical snapshots of FTX's balance on November 3rd showed only about $3B in assets, of which $1.4B was their own token, this suggested two possibilities:
	  
	  -FTX had an undocumented "cold wallet" somewhere
	  -FTX was illegally lending (stealing) user assets. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020930376155136))
	- 20/82
	  
	  Given I had seen lots of large FTT transaction sold over the counter (peer to peer rather than on exchange) the past few weeks, I figured FTX was trying to cover up a hole:
	  
	  https://t.co/XH8BcDrXt5 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020932917903360))
	- 21/82
	  
	  That was when Binance moved their $583M of FTT left over from their investment in FTX.
	  
	  https://t.co/ldycfE4Eh5
	  
	  The next morning CZ made a rare announcement of their intent to sell their FTT:
	  
	  https://t.co/Xa3KZS1IfG ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020935799418880))
	- 22/82
	  
	  He noted irregularities among FTX.
	  
	  While I had suspected a small gap in finances, this seemed like something much larger.
	  
	  Which was suddenly confirmed when Alameda CEO Caroline broke he silence about finances, and offered to buy out the remaining FTT ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1593020938626355200))
	- 23/82
	  
	  It was an odd choice for her to publicly name a price and odd for Alameda to care about the specific price.
	  
	  It was this moment that set off tons of onchain sleuthing.
