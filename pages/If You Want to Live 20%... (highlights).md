		- **Note**: Thread
	- Caffeine doesn't actually produce a usable form of energy as many assume.
	  
	  There's a molecule called Adenosine Triphosphate [ATP] that our cells use as energy.
	  
	  As our cells use ATP, they create a breakdown product called Adenosine [ADO] ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509205954474119168))
	- As we use more ATP we begin to see a build-up of ADO.
	  
	  This build-up of ADO starts to bind to receptors of the neurons in your brain, signaling that rest is needed, causing you to feel tired.
	  
	  Enter Caffeine. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509205957233950723))
	- As stated before, caffeine doesn't produce energy.
	  
	  Rather, it actually acts to block ADO receptors. Otherwise known as a neurotransmitter inhibitor
	  
	  This prevents ADO from signaling tiredness to the brain. Simply giving you the perception of feeling more energized. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509205960123826182))
	- Caffeine also affects neurotransmitters other than ADO
	- I explain this because it's important to understand how biological processes work - especially in the case of psychoactive stimulants - if we are to develop a healthy relationship with them.
	  
	  When there is understanding, we are better equipped to make conscious decisions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509205965802917891))
	- Many of us tend to reach for our morning cup of joe the instant we wake up, and with coffee shops on every corner, it's easy to get into the habit of trying to drown our morning moods in a 20oz black drip.
	  
	  I hope to show you that coffee is so much more than a mood booster. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509205968621477888))
	- It could be argued that coffee is THE HEALTHIEST drink for you in the world.
	  
	  Yes, the healthiest drink in the world.

	- Dr. Sanjiv Chopra, former Dean of Medicine at Harvard says,
	  
	  "Coffee may be the healthiest beverage you should drink. People usually limit the amount that they drink and convince themselves that they do not need that extra cup. Evidence that they are misinformed is overwhelming.‚Äù ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509205979044335616))
	- Much of the literature out there confirms he's spot on.
	  
	  If you aren't reaching for that 2nd or 3rd cup of coffee you're likely leaving far-reaching health benefits on the table.
	  
	  Coffee consumption in the range of 3-5 cups/day has been shown to protect against numerous diseases. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509205981766381568))
	- Alzheimer's & Dementia
	- Over an 18-year study of men and a 24-year study of women, coffee consumption of 3-5 cups a day was shown to lower the risk of premature death in men by 20% and women by 26%
	  
	  If that doesn't make you want a steaming pour-over I don't know what to tell you
	  
	  https://t.co/3UIuIXm2xd ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509205991757271041))
	- This study from JAMA found that among half a million participants, daily coffee intake is associated with a longer lifespan and reduced risk of death from all causes especially cardiovascular disease and cancer.
	  
	  2 of the 5 top leading causes of death.

	- "Coffee drinking of 3-5 cups per day at midlife was associated with a decreased risk of dementia/AD by about 65% at late-life"
	  
	  https://t.co/iU6EWRbbL3 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509205998224875520))
	- This study found that those who drank 3-5 cups of coffee per day had a 45% lower chance of developing T2 Diabetes.

	- These are just 5 of the THOUSANDS of studies backing the efficacy of coffee as a preventative health measure, and a staple in a healthy diet.
	  
	  But how can such a small bean have such a large impact on our risk of developing such serious health complications? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509206004470202368))
	- The answer is Antioxidants
	  
	  These mighty beans host a powerful antioxidant profile, namely:
	- Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals, preventing potential negative effects on health. 
	  
	  Free radicals can damage cells and are believed to accelerate the progression of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and age-related diseases. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509206010526904320))
	- Antioxidants are critical to health because they inhibit the oxidation caused by these free radicals in our bodies.
	  
	  Oxidative stress can ultimately lead to cell damage, cancer, high blood pressure, and systemic inflammation.
	  
	  To combat this process - drink more coffee. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509206013462790144))
	- Studies have found that beverages are the leading source of antioxidants in diets worldwide.
	  
	  Coffee being the superior source of antioxidants compared to other frequently consumed beverages.

	- While coffee is truly a powerful dietary source of antioxidants don't forget about:
		- **Tags**: #[[favorite]]
	- This study is comprehensive in its analysis of antioxidant activity across the board concerning dietary sources.
	  
	  This information corroborates the literature showing that consuming coffee regularly indeed aids one's ability to combat oxidative damage.

	- And guess what, the positive health benefits aren't exclusive to caffeinated coffee.
	  
	  That's right if you're sensitive to caffeine or simply don't want to drink +200mg of caffeine daily, you can drink decaf and still get an array of benefits. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509206039840780291))
	- So now that you're coffeepilled, I want to touch on a few things to ensure that you stay enjoying your coffee for many years to come.
	  
	  Let's go over:
	- Mycotoxins
	  
	  These are toxic chemicals produced by molds and are potentially harmful to human health when consumed in large quantities.
	  
	  Mycotoxins are typically found in agricultural products like grains, red wine, beer, peanuts, and more.

	- Coffee beans, throughout their journey from farm to cup, are susceptible to mold growth.
	  
	  The Mycotoxin commonly associated with coffee is Ochratoxin A [OCA].
	  
	  known effects of acute OCA exposure are kidney disease and immune system dysfunction.

	- This is why it is essential to support coffee companies you trust
	  
	  The industrialization of production poses a significant threat to the toxicity of your coffee
	  
	  Mold can form from harvesting, climate conditions, poor practices, transport, and improper storage. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509206063676944390))
	- It is for this reason that I suggest doing research on trusted brands that truly put their customer's health at the forefront of their production process, eg. Not Starbucks.
	  
	  A few brands I trust
	- Organic Coffee & Pesticides
	  
	  Coffee is also one of the most chemically treated crops.
	  
	  Some estimates state around 250 pounds of agricultural chemicals are used for every acre of coffee grown. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPHG7FKVIAA3fO3.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509206073336508418))
	- Coffee is one of the most traded commodities in the world next to oil.
	  
	  An estimated 140 billion cups of coffee are consumed annually by Americans alone. 
	  
	  This demand places a great deal of pressure on farmers to produce crops which incentivizes pesticide use. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509206076637417478))
	- Buying organic not only ensures you're getting pesticide-free coffee, but it also means you are voting with your money.
	  
	  By buying organic, you vote for safer farming practices, vote for companies that support those practices, and support the farmers who grow organic. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509206079455969281))
	- ADRENAL FATIGUE
	  
	  If you suffer from adrenal fatigue I would severely limit your coffee and caffeine intake as it exacerbates the issue of adrenaline and cortisol because of prolonged stress.
	  
	  This can affect cortisol's natural circadian rhythm, making it difficult to sleep. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509206082337460230))
	- Combating sleep deficits with caffeine is counterproductive and what you really want to do is prioritize rest in every way that you can.
	  
	  This is the first step in stabilizing your hormones. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509206085210501120))
	- TOLERANCE
	  
	  With consistent caffeine use adenosine receptors start to increase in number, this is called upregulation.
	  
	  More receptors mean more caffeine is required to block adenosine to feel the stimulating effects. This can lead to excessive use to achieve the desired effect. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509206088100433922))
	- Pay attention to your body, and ensure that you are not using coffee as a vice for poor lifestyle decisions such as:
	- THE DEHYDRATION MYTH
	  
	  Caffeine is a MILD diuretic, meaning it makes you pee more, yes.
	  
	  But, if you're drinking a full cup of coffee you're also replenishing fluids.
	  
	  If you're drinking espresso, you're getting more caffeine in relation to liquid so it can be dehydrating there. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509206093917917187))
	- To wrap up,
	  
	  The health benefits of regular coffee consumption are vast, and when we pair them with the performance-enhancing qualities of caffeine these little brown beans could literally be LIFE-SAVING in a variety of circumstances.
	  
	  However, with an increase in ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509206096791040003))
	- coffee and caffeine consumption comes physiological and lifestyle challenges that we must be aware of primarily addiction, dependence, and over-use.
	  
	  It is extremely important to LISTEN to your body and to not exceed safe levels of caffeine consumption. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509206099638980609))
	- Obviously this is the tip of the iceberg of coffee and caffeine.
	  
	  There is so much more I want to cover and will be posting a Part 2 very soon. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briankimpson/status/1509206102553993224))
