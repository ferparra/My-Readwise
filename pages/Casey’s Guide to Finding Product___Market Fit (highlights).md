	- I define product/market fit as satisfaction that allows for sustained growth.
	- Product/market fit is not when customers stop complaining and are fully satisfied. They’ll never stop complaining. They’ll never be fully satisfied
	- Product/market fit is when they stop leaving
	- talk about the product to others to attract them to the product
	  invite people directly to the product to attract them to the product
	  create content that they or the company can share to others to attract them to the product
	  make the company enough money that the company can invest that money into paid acquisition or sales loops with a healthy payback period to attract them to the product
	- measuring whether a company is above it or not is possible by measuring retention curves and new user growth. If the retention curves every month flatten and new user numbers increase at a healthy payback period, you can feel confident you have product/market fit
