	- 1/ðŸ§µIf data (in structured form) and their views/lenses are decoupled they remove a lot of pain in human computer interaction. Or put differently: they will unlock superpowers only available to the seasoned programmer these days. https://t.co/lhaBN8iDEy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohannesMutter/status/1589988784308830208))

	- 2/ðŸ§µ First thereâ€™s no more task & tool mismatch: wrestling with an app or frustrated about missing features? DIY assemble tools from a component store. Work under the hood (if you want to) or pick a template. Things normal to a developer today but impossible for Jane Doe. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohannesMutter/status/1589988786926387201))
	- 3/ðŸ§µ no manual sync/ copy & paste/ data redundancy or normalization: start in one view, continue in another with ease, go â€žbackâ€œ anytime. Render complex data with different views side by side and discover patterns that otherwise require juggling the â€žstateâ€œ in your head.

	- 4/ðŸ§µ I think we can witness already a new UI paradigm to emerge out of the blend of headless CMSs (Sanity), personal knowledge management tools (Notion, Tana) and web browsers (Beam). Kosmik, Formable, Codex, WonderOS and my own endeavor are going that direction. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohannesMutter/status/1589988790718066690))
