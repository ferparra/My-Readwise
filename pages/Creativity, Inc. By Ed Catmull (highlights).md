	- Often, success and failure are due to random events. They can’t be predicted and can come out of nowhere. This is not an easy concept to grapple with because our brains aren’t wired to accept randomness. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/ffb49599-9d75-4082-a194-2a723964ce85))

	- Experimental projects give you a space to take risks without the pressure of making a profit. They allow your organization to explore new ideas, find better ways of working, and give employees with potential more experience.

	- Use Postmortems. Postmortems are meetings that occur after a project is completed in which you discuss the process as a whole. This allows you and your team to speak out about what’s working and what’s not. These postmortems should occur relatively quickly following the end of a project while the process is still fresh in everyone’s mind. They allow you to reflect on what you’ve learned and let you prepare for future projects. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/81bbd985-af9c-41eb-b6ac-a11dfa9a0d0f))
