document_note:: The Hero with a Thousand Faces is a book about the similarities in symbology between diverse religions and cultures, and argues that the differences between them are not as large as commonly thought. It introduces the monomyth, a unifying story which is found in all varieties of religions, myths, histories, and other stories. It follows the "master key" of storytelling, which is the Cosmogonic Cycle, which is the creation and destruction of the universe. The Latticework curates and connects the ideas found in this book, making them actionable in day-to-day life.
