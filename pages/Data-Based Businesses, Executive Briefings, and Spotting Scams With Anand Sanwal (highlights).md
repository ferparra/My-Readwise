	- How to make money from data without actually doing any data work
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Sam highlighted data that is easy to understand and sells it at high fees., * CB insights is a great business model.)

	  My kids were my kids were excited that you called me a shithead. So I appreciate that one. You're welcome. All right. Here we go. Sam, you put your favorites on the sheet. I put my favorites. What's interesting to me is we have almost no overlap, only maybe two out of the 10 that you put down there were my favorites. I had completely different ones. And so I say we take turns where we say, tell us about blah, blah, blah, blah, like the little, the little three set three word tagline and he gets to pitch it and let's react and let's try to get through a bunch of these. So we might go on random. Okay. Or drill down, but like let's in general try to go, you know, an inch deep on each one of these for now.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  You want me to go first? Yeah, you go. So the reason why I highlight basically everything I highlighted to CB insights interests me because basically you're not coming up with any data. You're just organizing data that already exists in really easy to understand ways and then you're selling it at high fees. And I think that's like the greatest business model on earth. And you've listed out a bunch of ideas, including like six or seven that were more of these like data. Yeah. So you had one in there called sawdust data and you have examples. You're like, you can look at what the government does. Like the government has all this data. You can make that clear and easier to understand for people, both the sawdust data as well as the government data products. What do you mean by all that? Yeah.

	- Idea: books about successful people from niche communities
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Businesses that work are those that have high consideration, opaque, and variable skew., * The framework that the speaker uses to assess whether a business is a good investment is based on these three factors., * The niche that the speaker is interested in is those that are growing, have significant variability, and are relevant to the listener's community.)

	  Speaker 1
	  I'd say the businesses that work are, I think like I, my framework is variable skew, highly opaque high consideration. And so I'll break that down. So high consideration means like somebody's taking risk or putting a lot of money out there, right? It's just like, it's got, there's some skin in the game. Opaque meaning it's just hard to find, you know, and I think if you go into slack groups and people are like, Hey, does anybody know X? That's usually an asset class that's like opaque, right? Does anybody know who a good vendor is for this or good software providers for this? And then the last one is variable skew, which is like, like a car is a high consideration software purchase, but it's not really variable. Like it's got a set of features you can compare them on a grid. And so the internet's really good for that. I like businesses where like the variability of the skew is significant because you can't just put it into a table. You can't like an iPhone's and iPhone is an iPhone, but like we launch yardstick, like, you know, I don't know, radiology software that uses, you know, that AI reads radiology images like those are totally different. And so that's like the framework I use. And so when it meets on those three, I think that's an interesting messy, hard business that's going to be a lot of pain, but like you could build a moat around that.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  All right. Do you want to do it? Oh, sorry.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I love your column. So I told you you have 77 rows. So those are the different ideas. But then you had some columns. One of them was frame frameworks or inflections. And that was your, that was one of your things. So pay variable skew high consideration. The other one you had was tiny, but growing niches, like, or like inflection, like it might be time for that to grow. Is that, is that your other one that you look for in ideas? And we can give an example here of like you did this representation media. So you said extend the rebel, rebel girls book for other communities. And then your framework was tiny, but growing niches. So talk about that idea and explain it with that framework. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So rebel girls, if you're a parent of a daughter, you might be familiar with it. So we bought this book and my daughter was, you know, three, four. And it's just like one or two page stories of like famous women in history. So like Amelia Earhart, Marie Curie, Maya Angelou. And it's great. Like it's a, it's a really kind of inspiring book, really cool artwork. That book is sold, I think 5.5 million copies at like $20. So it's like $110 million. And that's probably dated, right? But I think there's like this idea of like what I, what I call representation media, right? I bet you could extend that to, I don't know, like Hispanic entrepreneurs or like autistic scientists, right? Like people want to read about and see examples of success in their communities. And so I think you could extend rebel girls across a bunch of different things. And so that's the, I think that niche is growing, right? Like people, like you get these micro communities that actually are pretty large that would love to read about themselves and receive good representations of themselves.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  That's a great idea. I've had the, I've had a similar idea because we get gifted some books that are like, I don't know, like Hindu religion book or like, but it was like the kids version or something like that. ([Time 0:07:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5df37457-6bb0-4ca3-a9d5-63833782e4a5))
	- How to build an effective data asset
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Data is a valuable asset that can be used to improve business operations., * Out of 100 people will not do the work necessary to collect this data, so it is important to build an asset that can be sold to others., * It can be a profitable side hustle to collect data on behalf of others.)

	  Speaker 3
	  Do you want to like, I don't know about you, Sean, but like what is we're talking about some nerdy stuff here? But I find it like crazy fascinating because it's very clear to see the opportunity here. But what's shocking is like when you say, I'm going to go get the data, someone like me, I would be like, well, I got to go like Google it and like find a database. And you're like, no, I'll just like hire like, I'll use mechanical Turk. You said earlier or I'll just hire someone or I'll just like make a ton of phone calls and just doing that stuff. I can get interesting insights.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Is that really how a lot of this works? And the beauty of that business is 99 people out of 100 won't do that work. So like once you built the data asset, like most people will think it's cool and they just won't do it. Like the other one that I like, which is I don't know if I put on the page is I was trying to get a pool bill at my mom's house and like pool pricing is just like it's opaque, highly variable and high consideration. And like, I have no idea what to pay for a pool. Like some kids should just go door to door at every person's house that has a pool and just be like, how much should you pay for your pool and like get the specs and then go find out and find out what do they pay for months for cleaning and whatever. I don't know what a pool requires. And like literally build the database of like. That's a great idea. Pools in North Jersey. Here's what it costs. So yeah, because that's what people Google to, right?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Like, you know, pool, pool cost and then my city, right? That's a, that's a term that people will look for. Or even if they're just looking at pool costs, but you have their, their city and the headline, they're going to click that one over the next one.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  And then you go back to the pool people and you're like, Hey, listen, I got this pricing next time you want to bid. You probably need to know what your competitors are bidding. So like you can sell the data to both sides, right? Like, but it's definitely like it's a perfect side hustle. Like, you know, it'd be like a thing that I, you know, I hope my kids will like just go do this, like door to door and go get data.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I love how even though I tried to pick a non nerdy data one, it actually underneath the hood was a nerdy data one. You're like the, you're a data hammer and the whole world is just little nails that you're just trying to hammer with your, you know, like, but dude, this is the best.
