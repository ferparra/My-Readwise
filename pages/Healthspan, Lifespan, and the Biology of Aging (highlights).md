	- How Did You Become a Therapeutics Company?
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Eric met his cofounder, Stanford, while they were both reading their sci-fi novels and they both had an interest in aging biology., * They found a company and started working on developing therapeutics for aging diseases by looking at human data sets., * The first step was locating and negotiating with special biobanks that had longterm health data on humans.)

	  The joke is that I ask Stanford is an incubator with a football team. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, exactly, right? So I think that was really critical, just meeting some people who'd been through the journey before and understanding that it could be done. The precise mechanics of how it was done, like that's so important to have that help early on, that opened that door. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Yeah, so you found the company and how does the company come together? I mean, you get a co-founder. Yeah. And so Eric, when you meet Eric, how does this actually come together?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, my co-founder Eric has been my friend since high school.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Okay, I do want to say.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So we were both reading our sci-fi novels. I think we first met on the math team. Yeah, well, yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So it's been a very long relationship. That's fantastic.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, yeah, and we both had actually shared an interest in aging biology. He'd gone down a career to get his MD, and we'd still always talk about aging biology, even collaborated on a paper together, actually back when I was in grad school. So it was very natural for us to do something together. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  To found the company, you get some initial funding. Yes. And then you're off to the races. That's right. Yeah. Maybe we could fast forward a bit. How do you go from having the idea that, you know, aging biology could have an impact in disease to actually becoming a therapeutics company?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  The very first step for us was to establish that by looking at human biology, watching the process of aging unfold, in the right human data sets, we could find compelling targets. As step one for us, the very first thing we did, when we started the company, we located and found and negotiated with several very special biobanks that started collecting samples from people, humans, when they were healthy and middle-aged. And these samples were collected as long as 50 years ago. They had samples that were collected longitudinally throughout the lives of these people that were tied to health records with information on how long those people lived, the diseases they got as they aged, and also critically their health span. So like how their muscles aged over time, how their brain aged over time. And this is what we really believed we needed, this kind of data to understand aging, because human aging doesn't happen overnight, you know, or doesn't happen in two weeks, like it does in the worms, which we'd like to study in universities.
