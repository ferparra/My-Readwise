	- Today we are launching the public beta of Stripe Apps, a new way for developers to extend @stripe and build on top of our platform.
	  
	  Some background on why we built Stripe Apps, what our platform enables you to build, and where we are headed.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- Our users around the world are increasingly leveraging Stripe to run more aspects of their business. We see business-critical workflows spanning payments, operations, support, and customer management running on Stripe. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/auchenberg/status/1529131508291620864))
	- Stripe is the gravity center for many business-critical workflows, and such workflows typically involve a range of tools. Yet, we have heard from our users that they are jumping between tools to get even basic tasks done.
	  
	  We can all recognize this proliferation of SaaS. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/auchenberg/status/1529131509457661952))
	- Yet we hear from our users that while they are using Stripe to run their business, they are also jumping between a multitude of tools outside of Stripe to get things done. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/auchenberg/status/1529131510502072320))
	- Itâ€™s hard to run a modern business with the proliferation of SaaS, and our users are already busy building their businesses. They donâ€™t want to spend their time re-inventing business operations themselves. 
	  
	  They would like Stripe and our ecosystem to help fill those gaps. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/auchenberg/status/1529131512225968129))
	- So when looking at this, we saw an opportunity. An opportunity to open up our platform, our industry-leading developer experience, and our design, to enable a new layer of Stripe that makes it possible for anyone to extend Stripe. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/auchenberg/status/1529131513261936640))
	- We are making it possible for our users to customize Stripe to better fit their needs by going to the Stripe App Marketplace, where they can install a range of Stripe Apps that help them run more aspects of their businesses from one place. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/auchenberg/status/1529131514310496256))
	- We are making it possible for developers, whether you are an indie developer or work at a larger company, to build new experiences that either extend existing Stripe functionality or add a new range of functionality that hasn't been possible in the past. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/auchenberg/status/1529131515426156544))
	- With Stripe Apps, we are giving you the power of the Stripe API together with a new capability we call UI Extensions that make it possible for you to build experiences that either run in the background or bring new custom user experiences directly in the Stripe Dashboard. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/auchenberg/status/1529131517032558592))
	- You can create apps for yourself, your company, or your clients, and with the Stripe App Marketplace, you can distribute those experiences to the more than one million businesses using Stripe today. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/auchenberg/status/1529131518253076482))
	- We know that Stripe canâ€™t be the expert in all of the solutions our users need, so weâ€™re investing in our platform so experts like you can be a part of an expanding ecosystem and help solve the problems of our shared customers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/auchenberg/status/1529131519305916421))
	- To show you what's possible with Stripe Apps, we worked with a range of early beta partners to build new experiences that help share context between business tools, simplify business operations and automate workflows.
	  
	  See them in our App Marketplace. https://t.co/DBFiOxqKo3 https://t.co/o9udRMMwL5 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/auchenberg/status/1529131547743223808))
	- We are incredibly excited to see what you will build with Stripe Apps. We're in public beta and canâ€™t wait to get your feedback to inform our future roadmap.
