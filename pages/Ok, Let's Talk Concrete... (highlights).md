	- Ok, let's talk concrete details. Is there an example of a company that has put all of these principles into action? Is there a company that has worked out a way to avoid Goodhart's Law?
	  
	  Yes. There are many companies, because these ideas are not new.
	  
	  One of them is Amazon. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1613103961506209794))

	- Amazon runs a meeting called the Weekly Business Review, where they look at 400-500 metrics in 60-90 minutes. I'm told it occurs every Wednesday.
	  
	  Some prior thoughts: https://t.co/ejlPicwDbD
	  
	  It turns out, though, that the WBR is a REALLY good example of Wheeler's principles. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1613104487882969089))
	- How do they do this? Well, they divide their metrics into 'controllable input metrics' and 'output metrics', and then they ... wait and see if driving the input metrics ACTUALLY drives changes in the output metrics.
	  
	  Seems like common sense. But easier to say than do:

	- But so how does this prevent Goodhart's Law? Well, if a controllable input metric leads to an undesirable outcome, they drop the metric.
	  
	  The WBR thus acts as a safety net, a weekly checkpoint to adjust metrics:

	- Finally, if you read Working Backwards (my summary below), you'll notice that the WBR is administered and verified by an independent group: the Finance department.
	  
	  They audit metrics, and vouch for accuracy during the WBR.

	- So the WBR process pretty much satisfies all the requirements for Joiner's list:
	  
	  a) They make it hard to distort the system
	  b) They make it hard to distort data
	  c) They enable and encourage changes to the system or to the inputs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1613106814698287107))
	- There's more about the WBR that I'm not going to go into.
	  
	  (There are non-obvious, second order side effects, such as your ENTIRE LEADERSHIP TEAM SHARING THE SAME CAUSAL MODEL OF THE BUSINESS; teaser below):
