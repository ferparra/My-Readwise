	- [Aristotelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelianism) [essentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism) is concerned with properties which Marcus defines in the context of a modal framework. One proposal is that a property is essential if something has it, not everything has it, if something has it then it has it necessarily, and it is not wholly individuating *e.g.* a natural kind property. It is otherwise claimed by Quine and others that modal logic or [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics) is committed to essentialist truths. Marcus argues informally that there are interpretations of some modal systems in which all essentialist claims are false. [Terence Parsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Parsons) later formally proved this result. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn3wwcgwt26fc5km3rvj5qhb))
