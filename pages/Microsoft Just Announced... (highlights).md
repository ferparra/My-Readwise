	- Microsoft just announced its new Bing with @OpenAI integration - using a model more powerful than ChatGPT
	  
	  I’m on campus right now with access. Tweet reply what you’d like to test and I’ll try your query -

		- **Note**: Thread
	- Access is currently available via waitlist
	  I’m told it will roll out to millions of people within a few weeks

	- Tip: try things that search engines today aren’t good at 
	  
	  Instead, treat it like a personal assistant, that has intelligence and can handle tasks and basic calculations 
	  
	  Example: “Will the IKEA Klippan loveseat fit into my 2019 Honda Odyssey if I fold down the seats?” https://t.co/EvSgMIPlg9 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/karenxcheng/status/1623055316350029825))
	- “I’m looking to go on a tropical vacation. What are some places I can travel to from SFO that are under $1,000? Budget should include flight and hotel” https://t.co/I7rppd5cgh ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/karenxcheng/status/1623058761287086085))
	- “Find me tickets to a Beyoncé concert in the United States where I won’t need a jacket at night”
	  
	  It understands that it needs to find someplace warm, it checks the tour dates, and it cross-checks the weather forecast during those dates

	- My favorite use case - having it negotiate on your behalf. I’ve always dreaded wording these emails
	  
	  “My landlord just told us he is increasing rent by $200/month. Help me write a friendly email to negotiate with him. Mention our lobby has been under construction for 3 months”

	- ChatGPT only does data before 2021, but Bing pulls from very very recent data.
	  
	  AND it can organize that data for you
	  
	  "Gather results of who won the grammy's last weekend, and compare that with the last 3 years. Create a table summarizing results"

	- Major caveat - you'll want to double-check your data for accuracy -  prompt from @Enuriru 
	  
	  Not everything it's showing is accurate
	  
	  "make a table that compares features of Augmented Reality platforms - 
	  Rows:"  (@enuriru specified all the rows below)
