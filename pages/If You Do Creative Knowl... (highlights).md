	- If you do creative knowledge work, you need a system.
	  
	  In 2018 I learned a massively useful system to go from collecting notes to creating shareable insights.
	  
	  The CODE Framework by @fortelabs:
		- **Note**: Thread
	- "Creativity is just connecting things." —Steve Jobs
	  
	  Creative people are better at seeing the relationships between ideas, which is a crucial skill in our complex world.
	  
	  Becoming a better note-taker and note-maker, you become a more creative thinker as you start to see patterns. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748743959453701))
	- Note-taking and making are under-appreciated skills in knowledge work.
	  
	  Our mental working memory is limited, so we need to externalize our thinking to be effective.
	  
	  Yet, few knowledge workers treat their notes as first-class parts of their process, wasting them instead. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748745205157893))
	- I learned the CODE Framework from @fortelabs in his Building a Second Brain course.
	  
	  Once I grokked the lifecycle of useful notes, I started to be more careful in collecting them.
	  
	  After all, a nothing is worse than a vague note; it'll just waste my future self's time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748746568323080))
	- "A digital note is a 'knowledge building block':
	  
	  A discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head." —@fortelabs 
	  
	  Like a Lego block, a knowledge block stands on its own and has value. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748747935674371))
	- Good knowledge blocks are reusable and can serve as building blocks of more complex ideas.
	  
	  As you remix your knowledge blocks, they become more than the sum of their parts.
	  
	  @RoamResearch is the perfect tool to capture, organize, distill, and express your insights. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748749185589255))
	- Our notes should drive us to take action.
	  
	  To make them effective,  it's necessary to organize our notes in a way that makes it easier to use them to consistently achieve our vision.
	  
	  In other words: we need a system as creative knowledge workers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748750443876355))
	- The CODE framework is that system to express yourself; to bring your perspectives into the world.
	  
	  Everyone has the drive to bring something into the world, and as creative professionals our livelihood is even connected to that drive. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748751668531204))
	- At the core of the CODE Framework is your note-taking app. Why so?
	  
	  A note-taking app enables you to:
	- So how to apply the CODE Framework?
	  
	  Let's start with Collect, or capturing your insights and those of others.
	  
	  Everything starts with a note, so you need to have a clear process on how to collect and store them before you can organize them for later use. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748754596237320))

	- What should you capture in a note?
	  
	  The vague but only workable answer: whatever resonates with you.
	  
	  Be it inspiring, surprising, personal, or just plain useful. Whatever resonates with you is worth collecting. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748755858690049))
	- Once you have collected a bunch of notes, you need to organize them in some way to make them useful for your future self.
	  
	  The organization phase is what trips up most people; they have no trouble collecting stuff, but subsequently never revisit their notes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748757209206789))
	- There are several ways to organize your notes.
	  
	  Tiago uses the folder-based PARA structure; Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives.
	  
	  As I use @RoamResearch, I don't worry too much about organization. Linking keywords is enough. Plus I have ((block search)).

	- Collecting and organizing notes is only a tiny part of the story.
	  
	  If you beautifully organize your notes but never revisit them, the whole exercise is a giant waste of time and energy.
	  
	  Don't let your notes die; by distilling your notes you gain most insights. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748760170438657))
	- Again, there are several approaches to distill your notes.
	  
	  Some popular ones are the so-called Evergreen Notes and Zettelkasten.
	  
	  @fortelabs uses a system called Progressive Summarization to progressively compress and remix his notes.

	- The key goal of distilling your notes is to make review a breeze.
	  
	  You should almost understand a note from glancing at it, so you don't need to spend much time processing it deeply. This will help to create connections.
	  
	  Strike a balance between understanding and compression. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748762762543120))
	- Aim for understanding when distilling your notes.
	  
	  You need to give your future self enough context to interpret the note, but not so much that no new lines of thinking are triggered. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748764326948869))

	- The second important characteristic of a distilled note is discoverability.
	  
	  Notes need to be concise enough that you can quickly glean and use its content.
	  
	  If notes are too long, your future self will not bother revisiting them or potentially waste time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748765694337024))
	- To compress a note, ask yourself:
	  
	  "How do I make what I'm consuming right now easily discoverable for my future self?"
	  
	  Compress a note by using metadata:
	- Ideas are only powerful when they're out in the world.
	  
	  Information hoarders go nowhere because they don't put their ideas to use.
	  
	  Once you have a bunch of distilled and interconnected notes, it's time for the grand finale: expressing yourself. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748768164737027))
	- To use your notes to express yourself, you need a process to dive back into your distilled notes and extract the most useful parts.
	  
	  In Roam, use block references to quickly outline documents, memos, and articles.
	  
	  This bottom-up approach leverages your notes to refine insights. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1412748769364348930))
