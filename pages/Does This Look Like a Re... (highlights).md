	- Does this look like a reserve currency to you?
	  
	  Lots of talk about USD losing reserve currency status, and the CNY gaining it.
	  
	  But NOBODY wants to own Chinese bonds...

	- Since early 2022, foreigners have been selling CNY bonds almost every single month (with the exception of a tiny inflow in Dec 2022).

	- They had some success during 2020 and 2021 when rates were rock-bottom in the rest of the world, and index including helped.

	- It is strange to have a reserve currency that nobody really wants to own in bond-form.
