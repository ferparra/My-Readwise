	  A lot of seed-stage companies that have not found product-market (PMF) fit want to be product-led growth (PLG) from the beginning and open up self-service for everybody to use.
	  
	  I think that's a big mistake. We'll talk about why in this thread ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mgonto/status/1494526365491601410))

	  When your company hasn't found PMF, you need to quickly work with the market (customers) to make changes in the product to find PMF. You might even have to do a medium/big pivot. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mgonto/status/1494526368243073031))

	  If you start with self-service and there's no more PMF, a lot of people won't signup. Those that signup will never activate. Those that activate will not be retained. When you email them to ask them for feedback, they've forgotten about you and won't spend the time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mgonto/status/1494526370910670855))

	  However, if you get some design partners (early customers) by using your network and your investors' network who feel the pain that your product is solving you'll have a great way to iterate fast and get feedback. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mgonto/status/1494526373662060544))

	  The person in that company who brought you in may be betting their role/position. Their success is connected to yours. They'll dedicate a lot of time to give you feedback, tell you what features they use and which ones they don't, etc. It's in their best interest.

	  You should get a handful of design partners. I'd recommend 6-9 so that you get broader feedback from multiple industries, sizes, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mgonto/status/1494526379085369344))

	  Once you feel there's PMF with those 7 customers, it's time to open the gates and implement self-service to get feedback from everybody.
	  
	  Very few products are lucky enough to get PMF from the get-go and have successful self-service. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mgonto/status/1494526513533702147))
