	- The bond market can be deceptive for many.
	  
	  Plenty of incomprehensible jargon and technicalities, which often end up pushing people away from one of the most important markets in the world.
	  
	  Let's start demystifying the Bond Market with a 101 thread.

	- There are two important ways to deconstruct bond yields such that you really understand what’s going on under the hood.
	  
	  The first one is:

	- Risk-free real yields represent the barometer of how cheap/expensive is the inflation-adjusted cost for incurring into more leverage.
	  
	  Borrowing at 2% nominal yields with inflation reducing the real amount of your due liabilities by 3% per year sounds good for borrowers...

	- ...and bad for lenders/investors.
	  
	  As our monetary system relies on ever-increasing leverage to bring forward future consumption and oil the ‘‘wealth illusion’’ mechanism, keeping a close eye on the real borrowing costs is paramount important.

	- Not only in absolute terms, but especially in relative terms.
	  
	  Relative to R-star.
	  
	  R-star is the equilibrium risk-free real yields at which the economy runs at potential growth rate: with those prevailing real yields, the economy doesn’t overheat or excessively slows down.

	- The chart below shows US 5y forward, 5y real yields against my estimate for equilibrium real yields: every time observed real yields approach or cross the equilibrium levels…ouch for risk assets and the economy.

	- Inflation expectations play an important role, too: Central Bankers often have a mandate to keep inflation around 2%, and hence they pay close attention to the fixed income market expectations for medium-term inflationary pressures.
	  
	  Why the obsession with 2%?

	- Simple: incentive schemes.
	  
	  As we rely on increasing debt to produce some decent cyclical growth, deflation is very scary: the real value of your liabilities would increase over time, making debt-servicing costs unaffordable and leading to a toxic deleveraging exercise.

	- On the other hand, high level of inflation potentially de-anchoring expectations are tricky too: the private sector might reprice their perceived inflation risk premium and demand higher wages to compensate for that, which in turn might boost demand...a vicious spiral.

	- Policymakers love the status quo, so guess where they set their targets?
	  
	  Far enough from each scary tail scenario.

	- So, when you see 10y Treasury yields moving up or down always ask yourself: is it real yields, or inflation expectations moving?
	  
	  Are they moving in the same/opposite directions, and why? Are real yields above or below r-star, and how fast are they moving in which direction?
	  
	  11/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1568971870170484737))
	- So: one way to decompose and understand moves in bond yields is to look at real yields and inflation expectations.
	  
	  The second way to decompose bond yields is the following.
	  
	  Don't worry: I'll explain in plain English (with Italian accent, ofc).

	- In our monetary system, the purest proxy for a risk-free investment is an overnight deposit at the domestic Central Bank - after all, that’s the clearing house for all commercial banks and an entity fully backed by the government.
	  
	  13/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1568971876407320577))
	- But bonds have a maturity longer than overnight, and the fixed income market is very much forward looking: the long-term expectations for the overnight Central Bank deposit rate are captured by OIS swaps.
	  
	  14/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1568971878425042944))
	- OIS swaps reflect the fixed income market consensus for where Central Bank deposit rates are going to be in the future. 
	  
	  If you want to grasp what the market expects Federal Funds rate to be xyz years from now, look at the OIS market.
	  
	  15/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1568971880580927488))
	- The Eurodollar market reflects expectations for future Libor fixings (not Fed Funds), hence overlaying a measure of interbank credit risk.
	  
	  The Treasury market also incorporates balance sheet costs and repo rates into the analysis.
	  
	  OIS markets are the cleanest tool.
	  
	  16/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1568971882820411392))
	- Ok, so OIS for risk-free rate.
	  
	  What the heck is an Asset Swap Spread?
	  
	  That’s (simply speaking) the difference between Treasury yields and OIS swap rates.
	  
	  Now look at this:

	- Wow, a positive ASW spread: Treasury yields (blue) are above OIS swap rates (green).
	  
	  Does this mean that long-end Treasury bonds have some sort of embedded credit risk that makes them riskier than depositing money at the Fed over time (OIS swaps)?
	  
	  No, not really.
	  
	  18/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1568971889837580289))
	- Asset swap spreads on safe government bonds are mostly driven by regulation, balance sheet constraints, the repo market and (in the short-term) flows.
	  
	  I will cover these in a separate thread.

	- Don't forget the private sector doesn't borrow at Treasury rates though: they also must pay credit spreads
	  
	  Credit spreads are a very important component of the Financial Conditions index: if they widen quick enough, the private sector starts facing higher and higher costs..

	- ...to refinance their large debt loads and hence faces restrictive conditions.
	  
	  If credit spreads widen too much, the access to credit becomes prohibitively expensive and the private sector moves into a painful and forceful deleveraging.
	  
	  21/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1568971895604936704))
	- So, two useful ways to decompose bond yields are:
	  
	  A) Real yields + inflation expectations
	  
	  B) Risk-free (OIS) rates + ASW spreads + credit spreads
	  
	  Those decompositions are very relevant to grasp what's going on in the bond market.
