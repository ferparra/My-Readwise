	  Well, yeah, I mean, to me, the scariest, if I have to call it one country, would be South Korea, where we're down to around 0.8. And to put that in context, we're talking of a situation where the number of children being born in South Korea at the moment will fall by half every 25 to 30 years. And that's a way to think of it. The birthright numbers are not very helpful if we try and imagine the future impact. I mean, what's the difference between a fertility rate of 1.9, 1.8? They sound the same. They're not. If we take a birth rate around 1.9, the number of babies being born fall by half every 900 years or so. It's effectively irrelevant. You go to 1.8 and that goes down to around 250 years. And every notch you go down, it gets deeper and deeper and deeper in terms of how far down this curve you are. You've got to look at other regions, of course, Taiwan is similar to South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore are very similar as well. Japan is a little higher, but because it's been going on so long here in Japan, the impact really is starting to notice right now. And finally, to answer your question, China is probably in terms of because of its size, the most scary in terms of what's about to happen there in terms of that age balance, where I just don't know how China will cope with the number of all people they have to support there.

	  Peter Zion on this show said that he thinks China's population will be down to 650 million by the year 2050. How accurate do you think he is?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I think he's in the ballpark. I think absolutely. What we're also unsure of is how accurate the numbers out of China are. There's a lot of speculation. ([TimeÂ 0:13:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/65343963-a76e-4744-8fcd-157295750cbd))
