	- Hereâ€™s my guide to kick off Product Discovery (incl. tools/templates)
	  
	  1) Define your Problem
	  2) Map your Assumptions
	  3) Prioritize your â€˜Riskiest Assumptionsâ€™
	  4) Create a Discovery Backlog
	  5) Design your experiments
	  6) Bring it all together in a Research Plan

	- STEP 1: Define your Opportunity
	  
	  Before we can even start discovery we need to be clear on what are we doing discovery on? 
	  
	  This can be as simple as writing a problem statement or through a tool like an opportunity canvas.

	- TOOLS for defining the opporutnity:
	- STEP 2: Map your Assumptions
	  
	  Whenever I'm doing discovery, it almost always starts with an Assumptions Mapping exercise. Assumptions Mapping is from Strategyzer's book 'Testing Business Ideas'.

	- Step 3: Prioritize your 'Riskiest Assumptions'
	  
	  You want to invest your time in tackling the assumptions in the top-right corner first â€” the important and unknown assumptions.
	  
	  These are your 'riskiest assumptions' and therefore the most important to test first.

	- Step 4: Create a Discovery Backlog
	  
	  Take your riskiest assumptions and list them down into a backlog.

	- Step 5: Design your experiment 
	  
	  One you have your list of assumptions to test, next you need to convert them into one-or-more hypotheses that you can test.
	  
	  Use the following format:
	  
	  Well will test this by [experiment]
	  We will know this to be true when [measurable result]

	- Design Your Experiments:
	- Step 6: Create a Research Plan 
	  
	  The final step is turning your experiments into a research plan. This is about organizing your experiments into a logical sequence. i.e. it may make sense to roll 2â€“3 hypotheses together.

	- BONUS: Timebox your discovery activities
	  
	  There is always an endless amount of things we can learn about but learning needs to eventually convert to action. 
	  
	  It's therefore good practice to time box your discovery activities - How much time are you willing to invest into Disco?
