	- @BlackHC Imagine an excel spreadsheet with your age (y) , height (cm), weight (g), money ($), etc
	  
	  It has a row for you and everyone else
	  
	  Each column is then  normalised -1 to 1, using min and max values of all people
	  
	  Age 0 - > - 1.0
	  Age 99 - > 1.0
	  
	  That's it!
	  
	  Don't try graphing it tho ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MathYouF/status/1619004404589559808))
