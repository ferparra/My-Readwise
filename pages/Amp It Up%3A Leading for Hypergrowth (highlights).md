	- Strategy
	  
	  1.  Execution is king but will only go so far if the strategy is off. Make sure that your operating executives are also the head strategists for their units. The CEO must also be the chief strategist
	  2.  Hire drivers, not passengers. Get the wrong people off the bus
	  3.  Attack weakness, not strength
	  4.  Create a cost advantage or neutralize someone else’s
	  5.  It’s much easier to expand a market than create a new one
	  6.  Early adopters buy differently than late adopters. Aim for the early adopters first but then have to use those examples to lure in late adopters
	  7.  Stay close to home in the early going – more resources and attention can be given to local customers and get better and more frequent feedback
	  8.  Build the whole product or solve the whole problem as fast as you can
	  9.  Architecture is everything
	  10.  Prepare to transform your strategy sooner than you expect – as a leader, you need to operate well ahead of the current dynamic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1awzq0xedgyb4p422ky1ns))
