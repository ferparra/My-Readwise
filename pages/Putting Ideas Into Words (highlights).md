	- Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows
	  you that you didn't know it as well as you thought.
	- You know that putting your ideas into words changed them.
	- The real test is reading what you've
	  written.
	- It may cost you some nice sentences, but
	  you have to resign yourself to that. You just have to make them as
	  good as you can and still satisfy the stranger.
	- At best the plan is vague and
	  incomplete. Very likely there's some undiscovered flaw that invalidates
	  it completely. At best it's a plan for a plan.
	- Can you ever know so much that you wouldn't learn more from trying
	  to explain what you know?
	- A great deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have if
	  anything a higher proportion of unconscious knowledge than beginners.
	- Putting ideas into words is certainly no guarantee that they'll be
	  right. Far from it. But though it's not a sufficient condition, it
	  is a necessary one.
