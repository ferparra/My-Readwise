	- [[@logseq]] Do you want to harness the full power of Logseq's outlines and links?
	  
	  Then you should also learn about queries.
	  
	  Last summer, I ran a two-week cohort and taught everything I know about how to structure Logseq graphs.
	  
	  See lesson 2 to dive deeper:

	- @vonadz [[@logseq]] Iâ€™m learning web dev and keep my notes in Logseq.
	  
	  Organizing code snippets is easy and it doesnâ€™t really matter where in Logseq you store them. What matters is that you indent/branch and add links.

	- Every writer needs a system.
	  
	  A writing system frees up the mental space needed to produce great work.
	  
	  And it doesnâ€™t matter what tools and techniques you use, as long as you use them consistently.
	  
	  Have you defined your writing system?

	- @arvidkahl Nothing helps sell an idea like passion.
	  
	  In my corporate jobs, Iâ€™d often nerd out about processes and software systems (yes, Iâ€™m that guy). But it wasnâ€™t my knowledge that would sell people on my advice; they always told me it was my enthusiasm.
	  
	  Lesson: show your passion. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1622770713428885505))
