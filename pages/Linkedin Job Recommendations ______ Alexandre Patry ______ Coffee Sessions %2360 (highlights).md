	- How to Take the Risk of Analyzing a Problem
	  
	  Summary:
	  Emily's advice to junior engineers: 'Plan for a curriculum of experiment and plan for learning you think along the way' She also says that your work is not yourself, so try to detach yourself from it as critical as you can. Emily on her time at linkton: 'It was an amazing experience but i'm glad I didn't stay there long enough to see all my friends go through their ups and downs'

	  Speaker 2
	  Ye, i think it's. Lok, an important point. I like the risking it, because i imagine, you t liif smebody has a new way ovatove idea, especially if its sort but, you know, something that hasn't really been tried outat least i linked in, you know, like maybe thee's examples in research, but it's like an open question of, like, whether whether it'll work at linkton, or how much work it'll take to get it to work well. So. Liok, what are some examples of, like, things people can do to like, d risk before, like, diving deep into a project like that?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  That's a good questn, so i think just getting feedback from your fear, so putting it out there and making sure that at least the knowledge around you is gathered and you get this feedback, is one piece of it. The second thing i like to do is try to get the enten together as fast as possible, so you have the complete feedback lop thand you can have a better understanding of of what's the weakest part. A, i've seen people stuck in analysis paralysis. You try to think of everything, and nothing gets done. So solution for that is just get your end dirty. Even if it's not perfect, at least you'll get some crickle that and some feeling around the complexity of the problem. So talk to your peers. Try to put something quick just to learn, not to fin al product, but just to learn what are the challenge and and go from there.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Yes, that's great. Ye, the taste of sharing. I think one thing would kind of like one to shift into a i a chat with you about, obviously, you were a very successful engineer at linkton. You ar teleed over a very large org. You know, obviously you mentar a lot of engineers and what notd i was, fortunately one of them. And i so what is some advice you would give to a junior engineer? Emily, we have like, tons of them in the community, and i'm sure that they're trying to learn and grow. So, like, what, what are your best fire tips for, like, these people that are like really trying to get their hands dirty and the stuff?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I think getting the ends dirtys is the first thing, right? You should look at your deta and just keep it high level. So many people look at mitrix and go from there. I think you need to look at both hands. Anecdotal piece of of data also tells us story. So if you're able to connect metrix with aangol data, tell your story, i think you're e're in a good place to convince yourself and others you're doing the right thing. A other thing is, don't plan only for your next experiment. Plan for a curriculum of experiment and plan for learning you think along the way. Plan for constant iteration and improvement. That's how we do macine learning. Experiment and nd, repeat and am ye. Always make sure that you compare what you're doing to other alternative and that you have success creterior. That's not i did the code that i wanted to do. It should be, i'm trying to move something. If it didn't work, why didn't it work? And then readjust and en continue from there.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  That's so huge. And that was something i'd like wrote that down now. And the notes. It is such a distinction between i set this goal and i was able to implement what i said i was able to implement, as opposed to, i set this goal and this changed. And this is how i moved the needle, not like i wrote the code and is now implemented. So that is a huge learning for me. And it is very much like taking the the eye out of things. It's like making it more about the project, as opposed to myself and my ability, right? I really like that as a team, team mentality, too. I think we're coming to the end. Is there any question tat or anything that you would have liked to have talked about that we didn't get to? Anything else that you want mention?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  No, i think we've covered it all. And i just want to emphasise it, your work is not yourself, so try to detach yourself from it. Try to be as critical as you can. I it's soke for an experiment o not work. It's not the reflection of your failure. It's just you learn something and you move on. So should be comfortable with with those learning that didn't resulted intheva that you run.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  And your team is hiring linguists.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I don't know how any linguists we're hiring these days, but we're always hiring mel engineer. So there you go.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  So if anyone wants m go and work with alex. He's always hiring ml engineers. You heard it straight from him.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  This has been all and highly recommended to work with alex, by the way. Thanks. Go.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  That's it. That's where schyler was trained, in the the deep arts, the dark arts of the m l engineer. So this is all. This has been awesome, man. Like, there are probably 20 quotes that i could pull out of here and will recycle and will reuse in other conversations that i have to make myself sound smart and like i know what i'm talking about. So i appreciate this so much. Thanks.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yo. That for the wasn i discussing with you as thanks.
