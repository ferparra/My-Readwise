	  You want to have a PhD to be a scientist. You can be a five-year-old kid, can be a scientist. A grandmother who owns a flower shop in Brooklyn could be a scientist, right? Using things like eye tree, the track, different species, a family who likes to go walking in maybe the Appalachian Trail.

	  A lot of times people are hesitant to get involved because they might be worried about their abilities. Like, oh, am I going to be good enough? Am I good enough at identifying my butterflies to contribute to this or my birds or whatever it might be? And so I guess I would just emphasize that for a lot of projects, the way they're designed is that for many of them, there are no prerequisites in terms of skills. Do you need to just be able to follow careful instructions?

	  According to Cooper, Citizen Science is a great example of collective action in practice. Every documentation, no matter where you are or what you're studying, matters. It's not just about your individual observation, but about the collective results.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  Sometimes I might feel really small, like, who cares about my one observation, but like especially now, there's so much need for us to shift from kind of an individual mindset to this collective mindset and realize what we can do when we're all being part of a coordinated effort striving for a common goal.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Citizen Science is not only about collective action, but also building community. Citizen Science projects rely on a community of participants and professionals from all corners of life. You might participate in a project through local institutions like a school or church. I think Citizen Science provides an opportunity for people to learn more about the world around them.

	  You're connecting not only to the world around you, but your family and other people and you kind of start belonging to this community of people, which is really cool too. ([TimeÂ 0:13:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e7d0be60-efdb-4975-bc9a-c59e41a99918))
