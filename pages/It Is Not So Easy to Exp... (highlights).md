	- It is not so easy to explain @TeamTopologies main thoughts in a few sentences, but let's give it a try: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kl_johnny/status/1425524029167968256))

	- 1. build a team with true end-2-end responsibility for their software (design, develop, maintain, support, run). kill hand-offs. (you build it, you run it) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kl_johnny/status/1425524031063797762))
	- 2. take care that this software is not too big or too complex for the teams cognitive capacity. the software needs to fit in the team's head. you can increase the team size to increase cognitive capacity, but only up to around 5-8 people (cognitive load and dunbar's number) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kl_johnny/status/1425524032875765761))
	- 3. if the software gets bigger than the team's capacity, break the software into smaller parts at their natural fracture planes and rebuild your team structure. Split the software in a way the teams can still work autonomously and are "stream-aligned" like in #1. (Conway's law) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kl_johnny/status/1425524034716983302))
	- 4. try to reduce the stream-aligned-team's cognitive load with platform teams. Platform teams build modern platforms with self-service APIs. However, they are not responsible for the stream-aligned-team's applications and should not be a blocker in the team's flow of work.

	- 5. try to reduce the stream-aligned-team's cognitive load with enabling teams. Enabling teams help stream-aligned-teams to gain new capabilities for delivering better software (knowledge transfer) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kl_johnny/status/1425524038743609349))
