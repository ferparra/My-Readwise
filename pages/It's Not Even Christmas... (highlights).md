	- It's not even Christmas and TS-Pattern just crossed âœ¨5K Stars on GitHubâœ¨
	  
	  Ilâ€™s a good time to think about the *next* major version!
	  
	  Here are 5 features Iâ€™d like to include in âœ¨TS-Pattern V5âœ¨ ðŸ§µðŸ‘‡

	- Feature nÂº1 â€” More out-of-the-box matcher functions for Strings and Numbers

	- Feature nÂº2: Variadic Tuples support.
	  
	  We will finally be able to match non-empty arrays!

	- Feature nÂº3: Custom Matcher Protocol
	  
	  Wouldnâ€™t be nice if you could choose how TS-Pattern should match your OWN data type?
	  
	  It would be super cool for third party libraries too:

	- Feature nÂº4: Evaluate `match` eagerly.
	  
	  Currently, nothing happens until you call .exhaustive(), .otherwise() or .run() at the end of your pattern matching expression.
	  
	  This is counter intuitive to newcomers, I think we should fix that.

	- Feature nÂº5: Make subsequent .with clause inherit the narrowing of their predecessors.
	  
	  This would be cool, but Iâ€™m affrayed that this would be costly in terms of compile-time performance. 
	  
	  Iâ€™ll have to give it a shot:
