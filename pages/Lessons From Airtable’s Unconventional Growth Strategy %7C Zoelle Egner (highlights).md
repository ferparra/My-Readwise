	- The Power of Having a Mission and a Vision
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Having a compelling mission and vision is important for companies to hire well., * Authenticity is key for companies to be successful.)

	  And that's really exciting. Just a double click on that one actually reminds me some founders of companies I've invested in. I often hear how much easier it is for companies that have a mission that people are excited about for them to hire versus companies that don't. And so it's a really good reminder of just the power of having a mission and a vision that is really compelling to people versus some B2B software that people aren't not excited about.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Even though there's great reason stuff, great B2B software, love B2B software. There are, I love great B2B software. I spent like most of my career on it, but I agree with you. I think if you have an authentic mission and people aren't just like, oh sure, okay, you're connecting the world. Like, but really it's, you know, sound like telephony startup like, okay. If people feel like it's genuinely authentic to what you're building, it can be incredibly meaningful.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Yeah, I'm just, I just remember a founder who's just like, he's a second company, first company, he did not have an amazing mission. The second one didn't. Like, wow, so much easier to hire for this new startup. So totally get up. Absolutely. Okay, number two and three. ([Time 0:13:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3a02066b-4814-488f-93b3-fa0ebc09179b))
	- How to create champions at scale
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* AirTable spent money on branded AirPods to increase the credibility of their employees and increase the chances that they would be successful in selling their product., * It is important to invest in swag that is likely to be appreciated by your customers, as this will increase the chances that they will be more likely to recommend your product to others.)

	  Hopefully not, hopefully not, but once you actually get in with folks, it's very difficult to remove it, right? So like suddenly your attention rates are incredible, your word of mouth is incredible. If you're willing to do that, initial work. A lot of people think that AirTable was like a pure product-led growth company and missed that like huge customer success component that was always very, very important in the early days. And that helped us ultimately move more towards that PLG motion for a while, but was it essential to getting it set up in the first place?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Fascinating.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  The other one that we did, related to this, Champions at Scale, was we spent a hilarious amount of money on a really fancy swag. I know this sounds silly, but like branded AirPods level of fancy swag. Admittedly, more people were in the office back then. Now they are more remote and this would not work as well. But back in the day, if you gave people something really good, like not a pen or a sticker, really good, they would show it off to absolutely everyone that they talked to, because they were so excited they got branded AirPods. People would ask about it walking by their desks. It sounds so like trivial, but for that like, you know, a couple hundred bucks that we spent knowing like, Hey, this person's already a champion. And if someone asks them, they're going to give a really good pitch, totally worth it. Sometimes better to not skimp on swag. Hard to measure, very effective.

	- How to Use Templates to Increase Conversion Rates
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Templates can be helpful if used correctly, by narrowing the surface area for users and helping them understand how to connect the dots between their problem and the product., * They are not a top of funnel mechanism, but can be incredibly helpful in expanding within a company.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  I think they can be tremendously helpful if you were horizontal because they help to narrow the surface area for a user so they understand how to connect the dots between their problem and your product. And if it is not obvious to someone how they can solve a specific problem, they're gonna be like, oh, hey, that seems really cool. When I think of something, I'll definitely come back and then you have lost them. And so if you can be like here are three templates that a person like you might be excited about, that can be really helpful. Where people sometimes get confused about templates or have the wrong expectations about templates is when they think that templates are going to be an acquisition mechanism and they don't build in the foundation that is necessary for that to be true. So a lot of people think that templates were what drove like air tables top of tunnel. That is not the case. I was having a conversation with someone who works a lot on SEO at air table in the much later days and sort of laughing over the fact that people thought that was a big source of traffic because it was not. We did not optimize them for that. Good luck finding them in search most of the time. Like not at all useful where they were helpful. You know, narrowing that surface area, helping with sort of matching patterns, helping people understand how the product worked. Super helpful expansion within companies. Tremendously useful, but they were not a top of funnel mechanism for us because we didn't put the work in to do that. Like we did not have an SEO engine. We weren't Zapier. Zapier has done a great job with that. They get a ton of traffic because they built it as a programmatic SEO play. But you have to be clear about what your goals are and what problem they are solving because otherwise it is very easy to like, I'll just build a bunch of templates and then all of the leads will appear.
