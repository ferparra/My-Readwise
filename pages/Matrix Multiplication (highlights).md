	- Matrix multiplication is non-commutative, in general.  That is,
	  normally 
	  
	   even when both products are defined (such as when the
	  matrices are square.)
	- A matrix 
	  
	   times a vector 
	  
	   defines a linear transformation
	  of 
	  
	  .  In fact, every linear function of a vector 
	  
	   can be
	  expressed as a matrix multiply.
