document_note:: This post by Michael C. Frank explores the differences between the scale of language learning input for large language models vs. humans. He presents four possible scenarios to explain the gap of 4-5 orders of magnitude between the two, offering possible explanations such as innate knowledge, multi-modal grounding, active, social learning, and differences in evaluation. He concludes that more research is needed to understand this gap, and suggests the importance of challenges such as BabyLM.
