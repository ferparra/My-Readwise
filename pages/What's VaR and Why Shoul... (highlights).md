	- What's VaR and why should you care?
	  
	  VaR stands for "Value at Risk" and is a core method to monitor portfolio risk. Brokers use VaR models to determine customer margin
	  
	  The problem is VaR may be based on long held relationships across assets, or even equities & equity vol.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- There are diff't ways to measure VaR using historical relationships, proprietary models & tests like Monte Carlo
	  
	  VaR models calc your max portfolio risk across various levels of confidence, like 99.5% or 95%
	  
	  i.e 99.5% of the time your 1 day loss is less than this VaR number ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spotgamma/status/1574519890517495808))
	- So, a fund manager may be sitting there thinking "the VaR report tells me I'm hedged on my BTP/Bund spread" or
	  "my options portfolio flips long vega if stocks drop 5%, so I am hedged"
	  
	  And, if your VaR risk number is within your brokers margin requirements. Its all good, right? https://t.co/naRhOfsH5c ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spotgamma/status/1574519908293312512))
	- It is until some 6 standard deviation move rolls in, smashing long held relationships. 
	  
	  There are a bunch of these relationships under stress now.
	  
	  Not just in credit markets, but also with relationships like SPX crashing but vol not moving like the VaR model said it would... https://t.co/hm8Mz3gPlH ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spotgamma/status/1574519921312161797))
	- If, during that market stress, your unrealized loss pushes past that VaR estimate you may then get a margin call from your broker.
	  
	  Sure, you can say "its your VaR models fault", but they likely wont have much sympathy.
	  
	  You then have to add cash or liquidate a bunch of stuff. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spotgamma/status/1574519923665240064))
	- Many funds have their own risk metrics & parameters which sit on top of their brokers VaR models
	  
	  Banks/brokers also have models that look at aggregate client risk. 
	  If risk from all their customers being, say, short vol, is too high, customer VaR models may spontaneously update ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spotgamma/status/1574519925397286912))
