	- One of the main errors people make is to see in Agile the same aspects, activities and phases as in Waterfall. This is a fatal mistake, and here's why: a thread ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/duarte_vasco/status/1633345659704160258))

	- I just read a book that had in it's structure all the same aspects that Project Management has. The same steps, and the same terminology. This is a fundamental error! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/duarte_vasco/status/1633345717380042753))
	- Project Management starts from the perspective that you already know what you need to do, and how to do ti (the plan), and the problem is one of execution control (delivery). That's totally false in product and software development! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/duarte_vasco/status/1633345749416017920))
	- In SW and Product, we only know a few things (and even those will get challenged along the way). We know the business we are in (at least some companies do), we know what kind of users we want to help, but not how! and...

	- ... often we don't even know some of those questions. Often we only have a vision: search the web in less than one second, make paper obsolete, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/duarte_vasco/status/1633345825567850496))
	- When we are creating VALUE, the value can only be validated by the customer and users. Never by us, especially before we even start delivering (e.g. while planning the "project") ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/duarte_vasco/status/1633345871457689602))
	- Project Management incredibly inadequate for product and SW development, because it's theoretical base requires us to know too much up front, and its succes relies on following those erroneous initial assumptions! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/duarte_vasco/status/1633345912335474690))
	- When you see an "agile" presentation using project management terminology, ask yourself: is the speaker using these words to translate, or to make people feel "safe". ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/duarte_vasco/status/1633345952533676034))
