	- One reason product management is such an appealing career is you get to sit at the intersection of technology, business, and design. You get to wear many hats and learn multiple points of view. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=227))

	- As an early tip, be as much of an observer as you can. Don’t try to disrupt or change things too much early on. You’ll come to a product and have your conceptions of what needs to change, but most times there’s a culture of making decisions and reasons for why things haven’t been high priority in the past. You don’t want to pull the trigger too quickly. ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1329))

	- Do you just go with whatever a manager says? If not, when do you speak up and why? Is it about your personal goals or those of a team? Is it about the short-term or the long-term goals? How do you influence someone when you don’t have the power to just make something happen? Do you gather data to support your conclusion? Do you rally support from those around you? Do you bring up risks or opportunities? What tools did you use to influence your manager, and which of those were successful? How did you adapt to your manager’s style?

	- Prior to your interview, try to look up the company’s revenue, profit, and user count. Of course, for some startups, some (or all) of these values could be zero. ([Location 3336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=3336))
