	- ðŸ§µWhy I chose @obsdmd over @RoamResearch? (1/n)
	  
	  Having tried both for 6 months each, my key insight: People who say "which tool you use doesn't matter as much, what you do with it matters, just write.." ARE WRONG. It does.

	- (2/n) @RoamResearch: a fantastic app... for outlining and data-basing other people's ideas with the right set of tags/links, queries and block references. Its so 'frictionless' to remix ideas that every-time I thought of writing something, it pushed me to remix and NOT WRITE. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chuckroberty/status/1421144986033164293))
	- (3/n) @obsdmd was the opposite - CONSTANTLY nudging me to write my own ideas. Its system encouraged me to think of links & tags as CONNECTORS, but always secondary to writing original (and may I add aesthetically pleasing notes) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chuckroberty/status/1421144987853418499))
	- (4/n) Of course one may reasonably ask - what is 'original writing'? Don't we all stand on the shoulders of giants? Yes and No. There is a BIG difference between being inspired from other people's ideas and consequently GENERATING new ideas built on that - vs just remixing.

	- (5/n) In a decadent society, with an even more stagnant academia-@RoamResearch is the perfect superpower. It allows you to game the system - endless citations, re-combinations, re-loops and voila! you have generated enough material for enough new papers to get that dream temp job ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chuckroberty/status/1421144991548665865))
	- (6/n) But @obsdmd believes in those flashes of insight that happen exclusively when you think and write deliberately and slowly, and not choose easy remixing. With a gorgeous interface + 'focus' mode, I constantly felt like writing more and more, and link only that which is imp. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chuckroberty/status/1421144993339633671))
	- (7/n) @RoamResearch represents hyper-modernity. Its hyper-'productivity' is machinic to the core. @obsdmd is a rejection of the hyper-modern, and its trying to find its way into a newer, slower and more deliberate humanity.

	- (8/n) In my journey towards @obsdmd, a special influence was @NickMilo. This video made me realize I was asking the wrong questions about my tools and made me contemplate on what kind of note-taker do I want to be.  https://t.co/j6r2rhuOld ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chuckroberty/status/1421144997127094276))
