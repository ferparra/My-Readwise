	- Somebody asked me how to grow a Twitter account from zero. This is how:
	  
	  -post high quality content
	  -leave high caliber comments in tweets of large accounts
	  -retweet good content with your own insights 
	  -tag authors tactfully
	  -FF mid size accounts
	  
	  The key though is VOLUME.

	- Most alts have already had a 50% pullback in 2021. Either from their Febraury highs, or last week. 
	  
	  Reason funding rates are now so low is simple: many blew up or turned extremely risk averse last week.
	  
	  That's bullish. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1387993076745089026))
	- Spotify pays musicians $4K for every 1M streams. So an upcoming musician with a single with say 300k streams would make about $1,200. Nothing. 
	  
	  NFTs could change the balance of power between large platforms and musicians, by empowering musicians to get paid per stream directly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1445544444137132037))

	- Most of the bitcoin OI increase of the last month was driven by the CME. The CME requires 40%-50% in margin, so max leverage is about 2x. In contrast, leverage in crypto exchanges is *much higher.*  
	  
	  Bottom line: the market is considerably less levered than analysts think. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1453734758651809799))
	- Stocks hitting record highs right before the Fed formally announces tapering next week. Exactly the opposite of what your smart Fintwit influencers told you. would happen. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1454120513882705920))
	- You have two choices in life
