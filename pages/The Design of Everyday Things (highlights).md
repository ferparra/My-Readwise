document_note:: The Design of Everyday Things is an insightful book that explores the principles behind good and bad design. It focuses on five fundamental psychological concepts - affordances, signifiers, mapping, constraints, feedback, feedforward - to explain how to achieve discoverability in design. The book also explores Human Centered Design and the importance of creating products that meet human needs, are understandable and usable, and provide a positive and enjoyable experience. It provides an overview of the seven fundamental principles of design, different types of errors, and the importance of root cause analysis. Additionally, the book highlights the importance of communication between machines and people, the necessity of testing and sensibility checks, and the impact of cultural constraints and conventions.

- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Feb 21st, 2023]]
	- Mapping - the relationship between the elements of two sets of things
	  
	  1.  Best mapping - controls are mounted directly on the item to be controlled
	  2.  Second best - controls are as close as possible to the object to be controlled
	  3.  Third best - controls are arranged in the same spatial configuration of as the objects to be controlled ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmmndfp7havpfkkf4pdn1f))
		- **Note**: The Design of Everyday Things emphasizes the importance of mapping when it comes to controls for everyday objects. The best mapping would be to mount the controls directly on the object to be controlled, followed by placing the controls as close as possible. The third best option would be to arrange the controls in the same spatial configuration as the objects they control.
	- Conceptual Models - an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works. It doesn't have to be complete or even accurate as long as its useful ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmnaawg87hchxn8gwk5eme))
	- Forcing Function - failure at one stage prevents the next stage from happening. Many errors stem from interruption
	  
	  1.  Interlocks - forces operations to take place in proper sequence
	  2.  Lock-In - Keeps an operation active, preventing someone from prematurely stopping it. (happens with ERP for example, confusion comes in when trying to switch which leads to lock-in for the current system)
	  3.  Lockouts - prevents someone from entering a space that is dangerous, or prevents an event from occurring. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmncjf28sbq7kr8agsgz6v))
		- **Note**: The Design of Everyday Things outlines three methods for preventing errors from occurring: interlocks, lock-in, and lockouts. Interlocks require operations to take place in the proper sequence, lock-in keeps an operation active, and lockouts prevent someone from entering a dangerous space or prevent an event from occurring.
	- 7 Stages of Action
	  
	  1.  Goal (form the goal) - what do I want to accomplish?
	  2.  Plan (the action) - What are the alternative action sequences?
	  3.  Specify (an action sequence) - What action can I do now?
	  4.  Perform (the action sequence) - How do I do it?
	  5.  Perceive (the state of the world) - What happened?
	  6.  Interpret (the perception) - What does it mean?
	  7.  Compare (the outcome with the goal) - Is this okay? Have I accomplished my goal? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmpd5s3v90jgt72fgegv8z))
		- **Note**: This document outlines the seven stages of action which are forming a goal, looking at action sequences, specifying an action, performing it, perceiving the state of the world, interpreting the perception, and comparing the outcome with the goal.
	- The insights from the 7 stages of action lead us to 7 fundamental principles of design
	  
	  1.  Discoverability
	  2.  Feedback
	  3.  Conceptual Model
	  4.  Affordances
	  5.  Signifiers
	  6.  Mappings
	  7.  Constraints ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmybejk60eqbs446t2trbw))
		- **Note**: The Design of Everyday Things outlines seven fundamental principles of design: discoverability, feedback, a conceptual model, affordances, signifiers, mappings, and constraints. These principles are meant to help create a user-friendly environment that is easy to understand and navigate.
	- 3 Levels of Processing
	  
	  1.  Visceral (lizard brain)
	  2.  Behavioral (learned but subconscious skills)
	  3.  Reflecetive (conscious cognition)
	  4.  Design must take place at all 3 levels - do not blame people when they fail to use your products correctly, take people's difficulties as signifiers as to how to improve, eliminate all error messages and replace with help and guidance messages, make it possible to correct problems directly from help and guidance messages, assume that what people have done is partially correct, think positively ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmq0t3sv4xa9zeg5d8rsyw))
		- **Note**: The Design of Everyday Things outlines three levels of processing: visceral (lizard brain), behavioral (subconscious), and reflective (conscious). Designers must consider all three levels when designing products and should not blame users for mistakes. Error messages should be replaced with helpful and guiding messages, and it should be easy to correct mistakes. Designers should also assume that what people have done is partially correct and think positively.
	- Two types of errors
	  
	  1.  Slips - person intends to do one action and ends up doing something else. Slips frequently occur when the conscious mind is distracted so, one way to reduce slips is to ensure that people always pay close attention to the acts being done. Provide perceptible feedback about the nature of the action being performed, then very perceptible feedback describing the new resulting state, coupled with a mechanism that allows the error to be undone
	    1.  Action-based - wrong action is performed
	    2.  Memory-lapse - intended action is not done or its results not evaluated
	    3.  Mode-Error - when a device has different states in which the same controls have different meanings
	  2.  Mistakes - when the wrong goal is established or the wrong plan is formed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmqbb8pc8e4yg2cbetc527))
		- **Note**: The Design of Everyday Things discusses two types of errors: slips and mistakes. Slips are when a person intends to do one action and ends up doing something else. To reduce slips, people should ensure they pay close attention to their actions and be provided with perceptible feedback about the nature of the action being performed. Mistakes occur when the wrong goal is established or the wrong plan is formed.
	- The trickiest and most important part is to design for when things go wrong
	  
	  1.  Understand the causes of error and design to minimize those causes
	  2.  Do sensibility checks. Does the action pass the "common sense' test?
	  3.  Make it possible to reverse the actions - to "undo" them - or make it harder to do what cannot be reversed
	  4.  Make it easier for people to discover the errors that do occur, and make them easier to correct
	  5.  Don't treat the action as an error; rather, try to help the person complete the action properly. Think of the action as an approximation to what is desired ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmr78peemnetxx68csc8ap))
		- **Note**: This document outlines five key strategies for designing everyday objects in a way that minimizes errors. These strategies are to understand the causes of errors, do sensibility checks to ensure the action passes a 'common sense' test, make it possible to reverse actions, make it easier for people to discover and correct errors, and treat the action as an approximation to what is desired rather than an error.
	- Precise behavior can emerge from imprecise knowledge for reasons
	  
	  1.  Knowledge is both in the head and in the world
	  2.  Great precision is not required
	  3.  Natural constraints exist in the world
	  4.  Knowledge of cultural constraints and conventions exist in the head ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmxp1cmn47cbfgr0qbsygh))
		- **Note**: The Design of Everyday Things argues that precise behavior can arise from imprecise knowledge due to the combination of knowledge held in the head (cultural constraints and conventions) and knowledge held in the world (natural constraints). It also states that great precision is not always required in order for successful behavior to occur.
	- Solve problems by interpreting, find natural mappings. Make memory unnecessary by putting the required information in the world. Appropriate constraints and forcing functions, natural good mapping, and all the tools of feedback and feedforward. The most effective way of helping people remember is to make it unnecessary. The unaided mind is surprisingly limited. It is things that make us smart. Take advantage of them. Pilots:
	  
	  1.  Write down critical information
	  2.  Enter it into their equipment as its told to them, so minimal memory is required
	  3.  They remember some of it as meaningful phrases ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmms2n9sr499yvjqmb29mc2))
	- Consistency in design is virtuous. It means that lessons learned with one system transfer readily to others. On the whole, consistency is to be followed. If a new way of doing things is only slightly better than the old, it is better to be consistent. But if there is to be a change, everybody has to change. Mixed systems are confusing to everyone. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmms9v5xf4bfhv1fh8r8dy1))
	- Standardization is the fundamental principle of desperation: when no other solution appears possible, simply design everything the way way, so people only have to learn once. The standards should reflect the psychological conceptual models, not the physical mechanics.
	  
	  1.  Skeumorphic - incorporating old, familiar ideas into new technologies, even though they no longer play a functional role. One way of overcoming the fear of the new is to make it look like the old
	  2.  One type of cultural constraint, provides a major breakthrough in usability ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmsdvhpyhcqt4kk18mdt66))
		- **Note**: Standardization is a last resort - when there are no other options, design everything the same way, so people only have to learn it once. This means that the standards should reflect how people think about things, not how the physical things work. 
		  
		  Skeumorphic is a way of making new technologies look like old ones, even though they don't really do the same thing. This helps people feel less afraid of new things. Culture also helps us use new things more easily.
	- Checklists are important and is way better to have two people do checklists together as a team: one to read the instruction, the other to execute it. If, instead, a single person executes the checklist and then, later a second person checks the items, the results are not as robust. The person following the checklist, feeling confident that any errors would be caught, might do the steps too quickly. But the same bias affects the checker. Confident in the ability of the first person, the checker often does a quick, less than thorough job. One paradox of groups is that, quite often, adding more people to check a task makes it less likely that it will be done right. A collaboratively followed checklist is an effective way to counteract these natural human tendencies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmx5zngyhmwb8hjbze2ecv))
		- **Note**: Checklists are very important and it's better to have two people do them together. One person should read the instructions and the other should do the tasks. If only one person does the checklist and then someone else checks it later, the results won't be as accurate. The first person might rush through the tasks because they think someone else will make sure everything is correct. But the same thing happens to the person checking - they might not check as carefully because they think the first person did everything correctly. This can be a big problem if more people check the task, because it's actually more likely that something will be wrong. The best way to avoid this problem is for both people to do the checklist together.
	- Swiss-Cheese Model
	  
	  1.  Accidents usually have multiple causes, whereby had any single one of those causes not happened, the accident would not have occurred. Like slices of Swiss cheese, unless the holes all line up perfectly, there will be no accident.
	  2.  Two lessons: do not try to find "the" cause of an accident. Second, we can decrease accidents and make systems more resilient by designing them to have extra precautions against errors
	  3.  Well-designed systems are resilient against failure. Design redundancy and layers of defense
	  4.  Can prevent errors by adding more "slices of cheese", reduce the number of holes (or make the holes smaller), alert the human operators when several holes have lined up. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmt8e3wsp9z112w7k3gb7q))
		- **Note**: The Swiss-Cheese Model illustrates that accidents are the result of multiple causes, and that by adding more safeguards and making the system more resilient, accidents can be prevented. It also advises against trying to pinpoint a single cause of an accident and suggests designing with redundancy and layers of defense to reduce errors. To further prevent errors, operators should be alerted when several holes have lined up.
	- Resilience engineering - goal is to design systems, procedures, management, and the training of people so that they are able to respond to problems as they arise. It strives to ensure that the design of all these things - the equipment, procedure, and communication both among workers and also externally to management and the public - are continually being assessed, tested, and improved. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmttv7q0ybw4ryzfr36412))
		- **Note**: Resilience engineering is the way we design systems, procedures, management, and how we teach people, so they can react quickly if something goes wrong. This helps us make sure that all the things we use - like our equipment, procedures, and how we talk to each other and management - are always being checked, tested, and made better.
	- Norman's Law of Product Development - the day a product development process starts, it is behind schedule and above budget
	  
	  1.  The way to handle the time crunch that eliminates the ability to do good up-front design research is to separate that process from the product team: have design researchers always out in the field, always studying potential products and customers. Then, when the product team is launched, the designers can say, "We already examined this case, so here are our recommendations." The same argument applies to market researchers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmvr742cynzrmbjbnw6n38))
		- **Note**: Norman's Law of Product Development states that product development processes are often behind schedule and over budget. To combat this, Norman suggests separating the design and market research processes from the product team, with dedicated researchers always in the field studying potential products and customers. This allows the product team to easily access the recommendations of the researchers when launching a product.
	- Complexity is essential, confusion is undesirable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmwj76mt76zej67h6rxbqg))
	- Most successful teams are a combination of human experts and computers. Weak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, to a strong human + machine + inferior process ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmmwzxtaw3n1eesrfjg0heq))
