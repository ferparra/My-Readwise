document_note:: The Big Short is a look at the financial crisis of 2008 and the role that greed played in it. It focuses on a small group of people who saw the flaws in the system and decided to make bets against it. These people had the insight to recognize that mortgage bonds were too uncertain and that subprime loans were a form of exploitation. They used credit default swaps and other financial instruments to make bets against the market, which eventually led to its collapse. They were met with skepticism and hostility, but their bets were ultimately vindicated.

		- **Note**: Greenblatt was saying that if you know a certain date when something important happens with a stock, like a company merging with another company or a court date, then you can use options to make money. This gave Jamie an idea: Buy a long-term option to buy the stock of Capital One. He was surprised at how cheap the options were compared to the stock.
