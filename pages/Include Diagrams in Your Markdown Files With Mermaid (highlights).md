	- [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid#readme) is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that takes Markdown-inspired text definitions and creates diagrams dynamically in the browser. Maintained by [Knut Sveidqvist](https://github.com/knsv), it supports a bunch of different common diagram types for software projects, including flowcharts, UML, Git graphs, user journey diagrams, and even the dreaded Gantt chart.
