document_note:: Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird is set in 1930's Alabama and follows Scout, Jem, and their father Atticus, a lawyer who decides to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a white woman. Despite evidence to the contrary, the jury casts a guilty verdict due to racial prejudice. Bob Ewell, the woman's father, attempts to get revenge on the family, but is thwarted by the mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley. The book explores themes of prejudice, justice, and understanding, with Atticus imparting wisdom on the importance of empathy and courage to his children. The novel also features the iconic metaphor of the mockingbird, symbolizing innocence, which Atticus warns them never to kill.

	- After Scout and Jem were attacked by Bob Ewell - **"Sometimes I think I'm a total failure as a parent, but I'm all they've got. Before Jem looks at anyone else he looks at me, and I've tried to live so I can look squarely back at him...if I connived at something like this, frankly I couldn't meet his eye, and the day I can't do that I'll know I've lost him. I don't want to lose him and Scout, because they're all I've got."** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gscw88qm4mkg9dd27kjdy616))
		- **Note**: Atticus, Scout and Jem's father, is feeling bad because he thinks he is not a very good parent. He knows that his children look up to him and he wants to make sure they can still respect him. He is afraid that if he allows something bad to happen, he won't be able to look his children in the eye. He doesn't want to lose their respect, because they are the most important people in his life.
