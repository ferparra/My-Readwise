	- Whatever amount people say they will pay for it is wrong.
	  If someone says, “I wouldn’t personally use it, but I bet other people would”, no one will use it.
	  The answer to any question that starts with “do you want” or “are you concerned about” will always be “yes”.
	  If someone says “maybe it’s just me, but…” — it’s not. Especially if it pertains to your product being hard to use or your marketing being unclear.
	  If you want to charge money for your product, don’t talk to people who try to get everything for free. (They might eventually be customers, but not until your product goes more mainstream or becomes a defacto standard.)
	  What features your customers ask for is never as interesting as why they want them.
	  Almost anyone will do almost anything for you as long as: the request is short, you are enthusiastic, they don’t have to make any decisions that require more than 1 minute of thought.
	  You can’t build a good product if you don’t genuinely like the people who’ll be using it.
	  You don’t have to be like them, but you have to like them.
	  The two driving forces of purchase and usage behavior are apathy and the desire to avoid looking/feeling stupid.
	  Whenever you start thinking”this is a lot more complicated than I originally thought”, it’s too damn complicated.
