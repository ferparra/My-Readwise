	- Bob Iger, Disney CEO: What's the Best Way to Give Product Feedback?
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* It is important to be clear with feedback, and not focus on minutiae., * It is also important to only give feedback that will make a real difference.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 3
	  On the last note on feedback, the other thing you said, and this is a part that I actually resonated with me personally.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I'm glad you read my book. I haven't read it in a while.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  I read the entire thing. It was very quickly. It was the specific details that stood out. And the one that really stood out to me here was not to be petty with your feedback. Like you already alluded to this already when you said not to focus on Minutiae. But I literally had someone call me like two weeks ago because a big tech company, they're launching a new podcast. And the first piece of feedback this person gave to her creative was, yeah, the music seems kind of off. And I was like, that's literally where you started. That's probably the worst thing to do. And it was like so relevant to what you say in your book. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Only say things that will really make a big difference. Well, the big visionary stuff first, which I thought was a really compelling thing.
	  
	  Speaker 5
	  And sometimes the petty stuff never.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  There were times when I had a list that was three pages long, small stuff that I just can.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  And essentially, it's a little bit like my business in venture capital where I have a rule where I basically never give specific product feedback to entrepreneurs. I know that. Yeah. Well, because I used to be an entrepreneur. These VCs would come in and they would say, you know, move this button. And like we had a person on the team who spent four months on the layout of that page. And the other problem, right, is that what you don't realize is a investor is that will then propagate down through the company. Exactly. And it really was just one person's opinion, but suddenly it becomes like a board mandate. Yeah. I just don't want to do it because of sure I have thoughts. But I don't want it to be seen as like an investor mandate. Like the colors off or is it silly? Because I'm not an expert on color. But it's interesting though, conversely, having worked with Steve much as I did, he did believe that details matter.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yes. And that a collection of details, which can be small in nature, actually made a big difference.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  And so the question is. But he's just, I mean, he's such a special, I don't know, the books where he's sitting in there going through every pixel. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, I remember he would take me to the Pixar Design Lab. Yeah. And take the blankets off the design tables and under the blankets for the new products. And at one point, I think I might have described this in the book, but if I didn't, I've described it at other times. He made me put my ear down to the way the power cord touches the laptop. And it was then they were using a mag connector. And you could hear the click of the magnet and the click and he admitted about 10 times that we're both over years down. Yeah. Click, click, click. He says, you hear that? It was clear is really making them feel good.
	  
	  Speaker 4
	  Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  But you're making a key point here, Bob, because there is a paradox. You're right with how do you focus on details and not pettiness? And there's a difference between the two. And I think you're right, Chris. Like Steve Jobs is an example of someone who's earned the right to be focusing on miniche because he's such a visionary. The problem that I see with a lot of tech people who do this is sometimes where people who come into a room, they'll sort of act like their visionaries like Steve Jobs, but they're actually not. And then they focus on the miniche and you're kind of looking at them like, yeah, I don't really care if you think.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, I think it's Steve earned the right.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Yeah. Yeah. And I think what you were saying, I guess I think of it as the feedback should sort of correspond to the person's expertise. Yes, exactly. Right. The person has earned the right because of experience knowledge that he's been proven right. And not just hierarchy. Not just our historian.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Exactly.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  I'm glad we talked about that. ([TimeÂ 0:12:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/519923d6-9dbb-4807-8645-b4be95e06779))
