	- 1/ Today we've deployed the first spell that will allow MKR holders to vote on the new liquidations system for MakerDAO, which replaces the English Auction system for a real-time Dutch Auction of collateral.

	- 2/ We're rolling this out in our LINK-A vault first. This means that liquidations on this vault type will now go to the new auction system, where the price begins high and drops over time. When it reaches a price you want, you can buy the collateral immediately. https://t.co/0pEFNilQZy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/brianmcmichael/status/1384311122950451204))
	- 3/ If you don't have the money to buy the collateral, we'll let you borrow it for free. You can take the collateral as a flash loan, flip it on your favorite AMM, and pay the protocol back in Dai.

	- 4/ If you do have the money to buy the collateral, that's cool too. You'll be able to use a wallet like metamask or whatever and buy it directly. DEX aggregators can also integrate these auctions into their price feeds. You may participate in an auction without even knowing it.

	- 5/ This should significantly lower the barrier of entry to MakerDAO auctions and provide a price as close to market as possible.

	- 6/ It's a big update nearly a year in the making. It's gone through a handful of audits by some of the best firms in the industry, but the markets are frothy and we want to have as much participation as possible, for the sake of vaultholders and for the protocol.

	- 7/ It's not all fun and games though. Smart contracts are still a nascent industry where the accuracy and precision of our code matters. You need to be able to trust the code in your pacemaker and your airplane and your Vault. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/brianmcmichael/status/1384311140654616576))
	- 8/ We're disclosing two critical bugs that were recently discovered in the End module. The core MCD code underwent testing and auditing in 2019, but recent improvements to our testing practices have uncovered these issues, which are getting corrected now.

	- 9/ While this industry is still growing, we hope to guide it to a set of best practices. In the same way that you expect your airplane to fly, you should expect that your smart contracts are safe. So today the SC Core team presents our security strategy.
