	- 1) What I want in a TFT: Idea Resurfacing 
	  
	  I want my notes to Resurface when I'm researching for content inspiration. 
	  
	  Either by being easy to find or automatically being there for me.

	- 2) As a content creator I constantly work with ideas. 
	  ▫️Generating them
	  ▫️Processing into polished content
	  ▫️Reusing the ideas ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yourpalomar/status/1492870416041402372))
	- 3) I struggle coming up with ideas on the spot. It's like writers block, but it happens every time I sit down. 
	  
	  👉 Every. Single. Time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yourpalomar/status/1492870419250135041))
	- 4) Being able to start with previously captured ideas is a deal-breaker for me.
	  
	  I don't need to stare at my screen until I get distracted or postpone my writing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yourpalomar/status/1492870421485662213))
	- 5) I love Backlinking in Obsidian. 
	  
	  I can create a topic and capture new notes mentioning it. 
	  
	  Then opening the topic page I'll be able to search the notes within the sidebar.

	- 6) Another thing I like is @logseq namespacing. 
	  
	  ▫️Parent/child_one/child_two
	  
	  I can nest pages just like @NotionHQ. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yourpalomar/status/1492870436929130497))
	- 7) A note that mentions "child_one" is shown in "Parent" but not in "child_two".
	  
	  The best part is that you can quickly create notes by just using the [[ bracket shortcut.
