	- Organisational Scaling question:
	  
	  An org does ad-hoc Knowledge Management with a disorganised internal wiki. They make a habit of asking questions in Slack. As they grow more, newcomers are too daunted to ask questions. The wiki gets messier.
	  
	  What ACTUALLY works to fix this? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498395923453386756))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Over the past 10 years I’ve seen tons of attempts to fix this with a mixture of SaaS and hastily-thrown-together tools, but it clearly isn’t solvable with software alone.
	  
	  Modern ad-hoc orgs try to make it a shared responsibility, but as it grows, everyone just feels guilty. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498396914986807296))
	- Loads of interesting answers already, thank you!
	  
	  Unfortunately, I have yet to see tools which really help here, especially since one of the wiki problems is that people take it on themselves to write their own versions of guidance for particular problems... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498401086847152128))
	- ... which means that wiki (+ Google Docs + whatever else), when searched, either turn up nothing or LOADS of things, many of which are covering the same ground in different ways.
	  
	  The docs are sometimes years old, and it's hard to tell if the advice is still good. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498401423461019651))
	- Several responses about how to manage this within engineering teams. That's a problem in itself, but it - like the Engineering dept - is a small part of a bigger thing. Support is usually outside Engineering, but often needs similar information from a different perspective. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498416128250441729))
	- Those who bet on Conway's Law making an appearance: YOU WIN! (But it was a safe bet.) https://t.co/2ZIQHy99nS
	  
	  And this is the problem with asking people to take shared responsibility for the wiki, because they will usually default to representing internal structures. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498416129038974976))
	- Shared responsibility has other problems too. Knowledge grows faster than the org, so the per-person load increases. There's little incentive; wiki updates don't usually get scheduled, so the time you spend has to come from elsewhere. Is your wiki work part of your perf review? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498481312029548546))
	- Or, to put it another way:
	  
	  As a do-ocracy grows, so do the gaps in its knowledge management. Responsibility is shared, so some people stretch to cover those gaps. In taking on more load, they spread themselves thinner to protect the system, and risk themselves in the process. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498484341009051648))
	- Pausing to look at thread responses. Signal:noise ratio is HUGE. Thank you so much, everyone!
	  
	  Most common response: "Yeah, you really need to pay someone to own internal KM. Ideally, a team. (Of librarians.)"
	  
	  OK, so:
	  Who's done this?
	  At what org size?
	  Why did [[leadership]] buy in? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498504852569272328))
	- Also got many responses talking about tools - and new systems for using them - to help with the problem.
	  
	  Unfortunately, with most of these, their effectiveness changes radically as an org grows. It's not just diminishing returns; the total value of the knowledge base drops. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498513774172532738))
	- I suspect this is worse with wikis than more structured tools. It's not that wikis are inherently bad; rather that, as they grow, their benefits create more blights.
	  
	  Entropy is magnified. Metcalfe's Law of exponential value doesn't apply without exponential effort. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498520916610805760))
	- (Huge thanks to @doriantaylor, author of the superb "Agile as Trauma", for pointing to Lehman & Belady's Laws of software evolution: https://t.co/PSqgYWi0H0
	  
	  Bear in mind that these laws apply not just to the KM tooling, but to their content as well. It's all software.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498530180221997057))
	- There's a whole thread to write about How Software Makes Things Worse in this scenario - but I will save that for later, because it'll have better gags
	  
	  it is, after all, a people problem
	  https://t.co/NnEzl16s2s
	  
	  In the meantime, a couple of vague "what if" ideas for fixing it: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498539008619540480))
	- As you can see from the thread so far, I'm particularly fixated on the Shared Responsibility aspect. We're used to the benefits of teaching newbies to update the wiki, and less exposed to the costs.
	  
	  (Dunno about you, but I'm fascinated by interesting flaws in system dogma.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498545882911830016))
	- Imagine an org rapidly growing while its KM system is already failing. Need lots of newbies to carry the org's workload. As they rush in, the growing org tries to evolve its processes to deal with the increased scale.
	  
	  (Everyone playing Adage Bingo: cross off Brooks's Law.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498548612288036866))
	- The wiki is increasingly vital, so the newbies are *begged* to fix any outdated pages with what they learn. After all, newbies are the ones best placed to make these fixes, right? They see the problems most clearly, bless their innocent, trusting hearts.
	  
	  Unfortunately: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498549742246064131))
	- here's what happens with a newbie on a busy team.
	  * Assigned a task, they try to learn what's needed
	  * Wiki is outdated, so they either take longer or just do the task wrongly
	  * Looking for the correct info, they ask increasingly-stressed staff having to explain something AGAIN ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498550927199916036))
	- So they're behind schedule; dealing with stressed people; encountered multiple contradictory answers to the same question; increasingly demoralised from all that PLUS their own mistakes
	  
	  and now they're expected to spend EXTRA time on updating a wiki with a well researched answer ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/yoz/status/1498551890321104897))
	- (Will write more tomorrow. Pausing here to obey My Partner’s Law: you’ll never be immortalised in an adage if you don’t get enough sleep, you ridiculous man.)
