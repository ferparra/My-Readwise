	- 1/ @Instadapp's new LM recently got live with a new @Uniswap v3 staker. Allowing ETH/INST NFTs to get APR from 9.21% to 6150.81% (at the time of writing this).

	- 2/ Uniswap v2 only allows to deposits liquidity at the entire range but Uniswap v3 allows users to deposit liquidity at any desired range and concentration meaning users can earn more, better LM rewards but getting exposed to more impermanent loss.

	- 3/ Currently on ETH/INST mining, users can earn 9.21% at full range (Uniswap v2 range) & 6150.81% at the closest range possible.

	- 4/ More concentration gives better APR but more impermanent loss & higher chances to go out of range. Once the liquidity goes out of range, the LM APR is ZERO. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/smykjain/status/1440055771845128200))
	- 5/ With closer range, users have to do constant rebalancing and it only rewards users if they are providing in-range deep (concentrated) liquidity that can be used for better swaps.
