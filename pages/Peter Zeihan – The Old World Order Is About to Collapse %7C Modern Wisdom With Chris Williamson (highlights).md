document_note:: Peter Zeihan argues that the end of globalization is occurring, and that this will have profound implications for the world. He cites the fact that people are having fewer children and that America's post-war generation was an exception to this trend. This, he argues, has resulted in a lack of mature adults necessary for the consumption-based economic system. Additionally, he points to China's population which is expected to drop from 1.3 billion to 650 million by 2050, leading to food and energy shortages. He posits that the U.S. is better positioned than most nations because of its geography and demography, and that the U.S. must build out its industrial capacity in order to remain competitive in a de-globalizing world.
