- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- Questions for writing a function:
	  
	  Should I keep command and query separate?
	  Do I write the contingent designs for errors like try/catch and logs?
	  Do I write the preventive designs for errors like pre condition or assert?
	  Should the function name describe the purpose?
	  Do I add some suitable doc strings on functions?
	- Questions for writing a module:
	  
	  Should I explicitly specify the APIs of this module, and make these APIs apparently different from internal functions?
	  Has all the unnecessary dead code been removed?
	  Do I design or use suitable Clojure records to model some immutable concepts of the domain problem?
