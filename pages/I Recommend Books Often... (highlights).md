	- I recommend books often — to the point where friends complain that a Very Cedric Thing is to go “read this book, it’s *just* 300 pages” (which, yes, yes, is a lot of pages).
	  
	  But I REALLY recommend reading Understanding Variation by Donald Wheeler. My pitch … ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1615265115724734466))

	- This book is everything you need to know about being data driven in business in 162 pages.
	  
	  Yes, there is math, but the math is elementary school level.
	  
	  It’s ridiculous. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1615265659642073088))
	- I hesitate to call this a ‘tree book’, but it covers a LOT of ground for such a complex topic. It gives you one major technique, a set of general principles, and then multiple concrete instantiations of that technique taken from real world companies over multiple decades.

	- The technique is applicable to the analysis of ANY business process.
	  
	  Manufacturing output, recruiting, sales, monthly visitors to your website, conversion rate — you name it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1615267100167405568))
	- (What’s the name of the technique? I hear you asking. I will tell you the name, and then you will Google it, and then you will think that you can skip the book. You should NOT do this — unless you want to blow your foot off while using it).
	  
	  But, ok: ‘process control charts’. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1615267828244041730))
	- The chart itself is terribly simple. You can teach elementary school kids to do it.
	  
	  The point is the style of thinking (and the org behaviour) necessary to use it well. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1615268205299367936))
	- I’ll repeat, once again: it’s well worth your while to buy the book, and read it cover to cover, and attempt to put the one technique to practice on a small process in your business, just to get a feel for the style of thinking.
	  
	  Don’t Google. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1615268775552770048))
	- I will possibly violate this tweet thread by attempting to write a summary of the book on Commoncog, but we shall see — I still have to use the technique long enough to get results. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1615269296372060160))
