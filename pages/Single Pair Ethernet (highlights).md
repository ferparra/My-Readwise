	- Standard Ethernet works using multiple pairs of copper wire to transmit data. To transmit 100 Mb/s of data, two pairs were required, for 1 Gb/s, four pairs are required. This means cables must be larger with larger connections and devices. With the magnitude of the number of sensors throughout the manufacturing process, the amount of cabling required also increases dramatically. That is expensive and requires vast amounts of valuable space. Transmitting those large amounts of data through smaller pathways is now needed. SPE can transmit at speeds of 1 Gb/s across distances of up to 40 meters as well as offer PoDl.
