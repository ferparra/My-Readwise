	- null hypothesis (often denoted H0,[1]) is a general statement or default position that there is no difference between two measured phenomena or that two samples derive from the same general population
	- esting (rejecting or not rejecting) the null hypothesisâ€”and thus concluding that there are (or there are not) grounds for believing that there is a relationship between two phenomena (e.g., that a potential treatment has a measurable effect)
	- Hypothesis testing requires constructing a statistical model of what the data would look like, given that chance or random processes alone were responsible for the results.
