document_note:: The Toyota Production System is a system for eliminating waste in the production process. It is based on two pillars: Just in Time and Autonomation, which is automation with a human touch. The tool used to operate the system is kanban. Just in Time means that the right parts reach the assembly line at the right time and in the right amount. This allows for zero inventory. Autonomation changes the meaning of management, reducing the number of operators and increasing production efficiency. The pull method is used to manage the process. It involves the final process withdrawing the required quantities from the preceding process at a certain time. Management should be done by ninjutsu, the art of invisibility, and standards should be set by the production workers themselves. Ford's approach of inversion, which is coming up with brilliant inverse conceptions, is also a key part of the system.

	- •   **All we are doing is looking at the timeline, from the moment the customer gives us an order to the point when we collect the cash. And we are reducing that time line by removing the non-value-added wastes. Simple, but brilliant**
	  •   **The basis of the TPS is the absolute elimination of waste. The two pillars to support the system are Just in Time and Autonomation, or automation with a human touch. The tool used to operate the system is kanban** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrhdxwpe0psbkx3sraek8rk))
		- **Note**: The Toyota Production System (TPS) is a system designed to reduce the timeline from the moment a customer orders to when cash is collected, by eliminating non-value-added wastes. It is based on two pillars - Just in Time and Autonomation - and the tool used to operate the system is kanban.
	- JIT is much more than an inventory reduction system. It is much more than reducing changeover times. It is much more than using kanban or jidoka. It is much more than modernizing the factory. It is, in a sense, making a factory operate for the company just like the human body operates for an individual. The autonomic nervous system responds even when we are asleep. The human body functions in good health when it is properly cared for, fed and watered correctly, exercised frequently, and treated with respect. It is only when a problem arises that we become conscious of our bodies. Then we respond by making corrections. The same thing happens in a factory. We should have a system in a factor that automatically responds when problems occur ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrh8znx065mbya041x45cf1))
		- **Note**: The Toyota Production System is much more than simply reducing inventory or changeover times. It is a system that functions like the human body, responding automatically to problems as they arise and requiring proper care, feeding, and exercise to maintain good health. It is a system that requires respect to ensure that it can operate efficiently.
	- Kanban = sign board to communicate what and how much is needed
	  
	  1.  Pickup information, transfer information, production information
	  2.  The first rule of kanban is that later processes goes to the earlier process to pickup products
	  3.  Constant flow and leveling production, in according with standard work methods, is necessary for kanban to work well ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrh87e1s94wp0hcp6xe32f0))
		- **Note**: The Toyota Production System uses Kanban, which is a sign board that communicates what and how much is needed, to help facilitate the production process. The first rule of kanban is that later processes go to the earlier processes to pick up products. To ensure that the system works well, production must be constant and level and standard work methods must be followed.
	- **The plant is the manufacturing's source of major information. It provides the most direct, current, and stimulating information about management. A proper work procedure therefore cannot be written from a desk. It must be tried and revised many times in the production plant.**
	  
	  1.  *Touching the medium* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrh9sgd9czfnxnn07raxz97))
	- Standard should not be forced down from above, but rather set by production workers themselves ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrhafqf1n97m9d0kk1f9qxk))
	- **I have always tried to view things upside down. Reading ford, I was encouraged by the way he repeatedly came up with brilliant inverse conceptions**
	  
	  1.  *Inversion* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrha203bb0h7m92a1hw8fh8))
		- **Note**: The Toyota Production System, as outlined by its founder, encourages looking at problems from an inverse perspective in order to come up with creative solutions. This is exemplified by the founder's frequent use of "inverse conceptions" when approaching a problem.
