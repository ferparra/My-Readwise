document_note:: Steven Pressfield and Joe Rogan discuss the creative process, the ego, the soul, resistance, the muse, human nature, the mind, psychedelics, unknown past lives, the moral dimension, and more. They discuss how the ego produces resistance in an effort to prevent one from connecting and trusting in the greater, human self. They suggest removing choice from practice and getting out of bed right away to counteract the resistance that the ego produces. They also suggest setting precise goals and that there is an art to being a person and that one can get better at everything they do. Finally, they discuss the importance of doing the right thing and being kind, as well as the importance of always having a project to work on.
