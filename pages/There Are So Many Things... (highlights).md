	- There are so many things about moving into a management or [[leadership]] role that, on paper, are simple when, in reality, are really freaking hard. 
	  
	  Here’s a short list of simple things that are really hard to do well. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryanrumsey/status/1331624473997537281))

	- 1. Define and measure what good performance looks like. 
	  
	  There are best practices and there are times to throw out the rules. Establishing those fences takes time and a lot of energy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryanrumsey/status/1331624474970615815))
	- 2. Teach others what you know. 
	  
	  Teaching is very different than showing. “Do this” is not an effective mode of teaching. Teaching includes providing space to practice new skills without recourse. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryanrumsey/status/1331624475889184768))
	- 3. Knowing when to provide space and when to step in when an individual or team is struggling. 
	  
	  The learning process and sponsoring others requires both. It can be such a grey area and is very much dependent on the individual you’re working with. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryanrumsey/status/1331624476795133955))
	- 4. Sharing enough of the bigger picture while ensuring you don’t share too much. 
	  
	  Providing context is great. Using your team as your therapy session is not so great. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryanrumsey/status/1331624477621440513))
	- 5. Being in service to others when no one is in service to you. 
	  
	  It can be really shitty when trying to be the leader you want to be when you don’t have a leader you want to work for. REALLY FREAKING HARD! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryanrumsey/status/1331624478611300353))
	- 6. Validating the feelings of others; especially when you disagree with them. 
	  
	  Validation isn’t agreement, but validation is a critical step in being empathetic. Separating your feelings about a decision from the decision itself is another hard thing to do. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryanrumsey/status/1331624479475249158))
	- That’s an incomplete list for sure. 
	  
	  What are other simple things that are really hard to do as a leader? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryanrumsey/status/1331624480872009730))
