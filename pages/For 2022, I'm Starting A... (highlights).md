- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- For 2022, I'm starting a group to practice order of magnitude estimation. 
	  
	  From "How many piano tuners are in NYC?" to "Is climate change solvable?"
	  
	  The goal is to enable everyone to powerfully reason from first principles to answer their most pressing questions.
	  
	  Stay tuned!

	- I'm planning to have live video sessions where we can discuss questions together, split into groups to discuss solution approaches, and then work through them together. 
	  
	  These will also be recorded for others to follow along to. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jamesgiammona/status/1477520645890064384))
	- Some great examples of order of magnitude estimation are @xkcd's What If? and How to books and @SanjoyMahajan2's excellent MIT course
