	- ðŸ¦„ Lotta people seem to be wondering how to use @Uniswap v3!
	  
	  Hereâ€™s a few tips and tricks... https://t.co/727PwVZyrI ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1390123562195894275))

	- 1/ In v3, you must choose a price range youâ€™re willing to participate in.
	  
	  If we deposit into the ETH-DAI pool, I could set a min of 4000 DAI/ETH and a max of 5000.
	  
	  In this scenario, I deposit only ETH but when ETH reaches $4000-$5000, I begin earning fees as ETH sells to DAI. https://t.co/fMLjKIcky9 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1390123569208758276))
	- 2/ Similarly but different, I could set a lower min = 1000 DAI and max = 2000 DAI but I would then deposit only DAI.
	  
	  I donâ€™t earn fees until the market price goes below 2000 DAI/ETH. 
	  
	  At that time, my DAI begins selling off to ETH as ETH prices goes lower while I earn fees. https://t.co/jFJWFzpx2e ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1390123576150433795))
	- 3/ The most obvious range is to set a min lower and a max higher.
	  
	  Say I am willing to buy ETH all the way down to 3000 DAI/ETH and willing to sell ETH for DAI up to 5000 DAI/ETH.
	  
	  Set that range
	  ðŸ“‰Min = 3000
	  ðŸ“ˆMax = 5000
	  
	  And now deposit both DAI and ETH, kinda like v2. https://t.co/QsG4u1exGR ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1390123580554465281))
	- 4/ If youâ€™re into stablecoins or pegged assets, then v3 is also powerful. 
	  
	  For a DAI-USDC LP, just set the lowest price to highest price where you are happy holding exposure to these stablecoins.
	  
	  Eg. Set low of 0.998 DAI / USDC and high of 1.01 DAI / USDC https://t.co/l0xHCQihzH ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1390123584874586115))
	- The TLDR is you have to be willing to do the opposite of whatever the market is doing but in a price range.
	  
	  Even in v2, if ETH/DAI is ðŸ“ˆ, swappers are buying ETH and as an LP Iâ€™m doing whatâ€”selling ETH!
	  
	  If ETH price is ðŸ“‰, swappers are selling and as an LP, Iâ€™m buying ETH. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1390123586648690688))

	- The key difference is when we reach the boundary of a range, you end up with 100% of whichever token was being dumped by the masses.
	  
	  If I set a price range min = $3400 and price = $3470, my LP will be 100% ETH if price crashes to $3300 in the ETH/DAI pool. https://t.co/E9aJgEYQA4 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1390123590591320069))
	- If youâ€™re looking to better understand v3, @0xNader wrote an awesomely simple post on how @Uniswap v3 works on @zapper_fi Learn. 
	  
	  Check it out and keep a lookout for v3 support coming to Zapper sooner than youâ€™d expect. https://t.co/iM7RgWaJM6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1390123592373973000))
