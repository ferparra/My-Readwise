document_note:: REBT is a form of psychotherapy which is largely in line with Stoic philosophy. It suggests that emotional disturbance is produced by the rigid and extreme attitudes we have towards adversity (A), rather than the adversity itself (A). REBT teaches that healthy negative emotions can be experienced in the face of adversity, and encourages the idea of emotional responsibility and self-responsibility for one's own emotional disturbance. It also promotes values such as self-interest, social interest, self-direction, acceptance of uncertainty, and others, which are similar to those found in Stoic philosophy. It is a tough-minded philosophy which can help people to live virtuously in a challenging world.

- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Feb 4th, 2023]]
	- people learn how not to disturb themselves when they encounter various types of adversity which renders them more effective at changing whatever they can change when facing difficult problems common to the human condition. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdst9g8x0xtzn23h7gfgn9e))
	- REBT largely overlaps with Stoic philosophy and can be a very useful compliment to the practicing Stoic. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdstrj2xxahdfdv6hf6fxbb))
	- Epictetus taught that:
	  
	  > *“It is not events that disturb people, but it is their judgments concerning them.”* *Enchiridion 5.* He then goes on to add *“So make a practice at once of saying to every strong impression: ‘An impression is all you are, not the source of the impression.’ Then test and assess it with your criteria, but one primarily: ask, ‘Is this something that is, or is not, in my control?’ And if it’s not one of the things that you control, be ready with the reaction, ‘Then it’s none of my concern.’” Enchiridion 1(5).* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdsw4j0ztwxkg7vdyhp1j0z))

	- Consistent with Stoic philosophy REBT argues that adversity in and of itself is insufficient to produce maladaptive, self-defeating emotional disturbance. In REBT emotional disturbance is defined as emotional and behavioral reactions that are self-defeating, unhealthy, and undermine our primary goals of survival and happiness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdsx4b128w1wy2sem49z5ay))
		- **Tags**: #[[adversity]]
	- Before introduction to REBT theory, people will often wrongly believe that their emotional upset is a result of encountering adversity. People will attribute adversity, assigned the letter (A), as the direct cause of their Consequential Emotional and Behavioral Reactions which I will here assign the letter (C). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdsy7eebhpwe9mp32wamrmx))
	- Ellis in keeping with Stoic Philosophy showed people that is not adversity (A), but our Basic Attitudes at point (B), in the ABC model which largely produce our consequential emotional and behavioral reactions (C). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdsyq14j6xnryj2kyd3dbxe))
	- healthy negative emotions are not to be erased or eliminated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdsz4fpx39t5gm4svtmm7vv))

	- The experiencing of healthy negative emotions in the face of adversity is good and self-helping and result when our desires, wishes, wants, and preferences are undermined by the presence of adversity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdszn0jcjanw8dq3ytpevsw))

	- Healthy negative emotions result in motivation that leads to productive action to change what can be changed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdt5wtpvh700y2749d4em8q))
		- **Tags**: #[[motivation]]
	- There are essentially eight healthy negative emotions which include concern, [[sadness]], [[remorse]], [[disappointment]], [[sorrow]], productive [[anger]], relationship preserving [[jealousy]], and productive, motivating [[envy]]. In contrast to these healthy negative emotions are eight unhealthy and self-defeating negative emotions which are [[anxiety]], [[depression]], [[guilt]], [[shame]], [[hurt]], unproductive [[anger]], relationship interfering [[jealousy]], and unproductive, self-disturbing [[envy]]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdt6tzv83fk3a9hax1wqdrn))

	- The primary characteristic of unhealthy negative emotions is that they are self-defeating. These negative feelings interfere with a person’s ability to live well with that which cannot be changed. They also undermine effort to improve things. Unhealthy negative emotions often lead to excessive behavior (e.g., aggressive behavior) or lead to self-defeating avoidance and escape behavior that is unhealthy such as excessive use of alcohol, sex, exercise, or procrastination. Most importantly unhealthy negative emotions are likely to interfere with a person experiencing some degree of happiness in the presence of unchangeable adversity.

	- By contrast, the essential characteristics of healthy negative emotions are that they provide us important feedback that what we value, want, desire, and prefer is not occurring. These feelings motivate us to change what can be changed and to get more of what we want and less of what we do not want. Healthy negative emotions do not undermine our efforts to achieve our goals and allow us to live well with adversity when it cannot be changed. Essentially despite the presence of negative emotion which is associated with being blocked or obstructed by adversity the individual can still have some degree of happiness despite the presence of adversity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdt9fr1ygb45ew9sfs7a3fd))
	- Learning how to experience some degree of happiness despite the presence of adversity is an important skill to cultivate because the human condition is such that new problems manifest themselves throughout our lifespan. If we do not learn how to have some degree of equanimity or happiness despite the never-ending parade of problems that occur in life we are likely to have a pretty dismal existence.

	- Epictetus said:
	  
	  > *“Remember that you are an actor in a play, the nature of which is up to the director to decide. If he wants the play to be short, it will be short, if he wants it long, it will be long. And if he casts you as one of the poor, or as a cripple, as a king or a commoner – whatever the role assigned, the accomplished actor will accept and perform it with impartial skill. But the assignment of roles belongs to another. (Enchiridion 17)* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtbmf33jt7x1zpcetp9qjj))

	- Epictetus also said,
	  
	  > *“Don’t hope that events will turn out the way you want, welcome events in whichever way they happen: this is the path to peace.”* *Enchiridion 8* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtc4kbrap1x48qvxshs9af))

	- acceptance means to acknowledge that something exists which is against our goals & values and that it would be preferable for this particular reality not to exist ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtd496wwb1f97e3925saej))
		- **Tags**: #[[acceptance]]
	- Epictetus taught:
	  
	  > *“It is not events that disturb people, it is their judgments concerning them. Death, for example, is nothing frightening, otherwise it would have frightened Socrates. But the judgment that death is frightening* *–* *now that is something to be afraid of. So when we are frustrated, angry or unhappy, never hold anyone except ourselves* ***–*** *that is, our judgments* ***–*** *accountable.**”* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtdv0q8yys7bac96zprc4n))

	- In REBT we emphasize what is called the Principle of Emotional Responsibility. Like Epictetus quoted above, we teach that humans largely disturb themselves about adversity. Emotional disturbance does not happen to us. We are not victims of misfortune so much as victims of our rigid and extreme attitudes we hold towards what other people do to us and what fate throws our way. In REBT we argue the individual nearly always has some degree of emotional choice in how he reacts to adversity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtfhvz0adsawfgt7ac2xvg))

	- Epictetus taught:
	  
	  > *“Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you must believe you are being harmed. If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation…” Enchiridion 20* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtg507xm781ah4kk58zzzn))

	- In REBT we teach this idea of complicity in our self-defeating emotional reactions by introducing to the client the ABC model of emotional disturbance. This framework helps the client see that their rigid and extreme attitudes, assigned the letter B, come between adversity, assigned the letter A, and their emotional and behavioral reactions, assigned the letter C. Prior to REBT therapy clients will think “My colleague made me angry because he absolutely should cooperate with me on this project!” This statement shows that the client’s model of emotion is that A (adversity) directly leads to C (emotional and behavioral consequence). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtj5yb85n9eb3rsm0a62zf))
	- Ellis held that all humans are born and reared to hold, to greater or lesser extent, rigid and extreme attitudes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtjje6jf5yze83c8qcpff9))

	- Epictetus emphasized that
	  
	  > *“We must undergo a hard winter training and not rush into things for which we haven’t prepared.” Discourses 1.2.32* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtke5rjqm71wxqy7kpgm5t))

	- clients are encouraged to reflect on their rigid and extreme attitudes when they are in their home environment to help themselves when they disturb themselves between session ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtnhgdwdannb5rbwwzjbj9))
	- He argued that absolutistic, rigid, dogmatic, anti-scientific attitudes were at the core of emotional disturbance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtpd2dh1yy680prtxq4229))
	- REBT teaches that if rigid attitudes are the core of disturbance, then flexible attitudes are at the center of emotional health. The characteristics of these healthy flexible attitudes are that they are empirically valid, logical and promote adaptation to the circumstances of life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtqke15dwx5dfmvafezz1x))
		- **Tags**: #[[adaptability]]
	- They are typically expressed with words like want, wish, prefer, and desire. For example, in reference to the previously mentioned individual who has been angering himself over a colleague’s uncooperative behavior in the workplace, this man could move towards greater tolerance and emotional equanimity by holding the attitude “I want and strongly prefer that my colleague cooperate with me on this project, but it does not follow that he absolutely must cooperate with me on this project.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtrrt1x7yrq0p2gs5rck1d))
		- **Tags**: #[[desire]]
	- An alternative way of understanding the philosophy of REBT is that through the adaptation of flexible and non-extreme attitudes the individual to adopt a philosophy of unconditional self-acceptance (USA), unconditional other acceptance (UOA), and unconditional life acceptance (ULA). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtsvzxtge3j57t35bh4j2c))
		- **Tags**: #[[self-acceptance]]
	- Epictetus taught:
	  
	  > *“If you are ever tempted to look for outside approval, realize that you have compromised your integrity. So be satisfied just being a philosopher,* and *if you need a witness in addition, be your own; and you will be all the witness you could desire.” Enchiridion 23* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtvgsagnm91c12ws9j0byc))
