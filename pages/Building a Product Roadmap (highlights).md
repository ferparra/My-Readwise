- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Dec 5th, 2022]]
	- Table-stakes: These are new features that will add value to our existing customers and also help us acquire new customers. It is likely that our direct or indirect competitors already have this feature.
	- Game-changers: Game-changers are also new features with the difference that these features will leapfrog us ahead of the competition and create a lot of buzz around the product in a way that almost everyone wants to use our product. You are likely to have only a few such game-changing ideas in your list above.
	- Optimizations: These are ideally smaller tasks that involve solving some problem in a better way such as a UI, UX improvement or a minor functionality change. Working on these optimizations will likely help our existing customers solve something quickly or intuitively. But these optimizations will most likely not help in acquiring new customers.
	- Distractions: Distractions are ideas that should not be considered because they are likely to not benefit the existing customers in any meaningful manner, nor will they help acquire new customers.
