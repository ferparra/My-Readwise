	- The other side of the coin: if I lived in the US, it's less likely I would have quit my well-paying job with nothing lined up (the high health insurance costs to bear if doing so!) and chill/write for a year.
	  
	  In Europe, there was no such risk. It's how @Pragmatic_Eng was born. https://t.co/B82aUNhEUr ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1624371830210396160))

	- The "crazy tax system" refers to higher taxes than most of the world: this funds healthcare and social security systems. 
	  
	  These give peace of mind both when people lose their jobs and - relevant for me - when quitting your job & taking a break to recharge/start a business. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1624372518923403264))
	- A thing to note about Europe that a Brazilian friend told me, who moved to Amsterdam to take a paycut from their net earnings in Brazil (!!)
	  
	  "It's hard to put a price tag on living in a place where things work, you don't think about safety, and there's no visible class divide." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1624375911079346177))
	- This friend used to make more in Brazil but lived in an estate guarded by armed guards. Whenever I traveled to SF to Uber's HQ, the stark contrast between homeless people on Market St, vs techies making $200-800K working there was just grim.
	  
	  There's tradeoffs, wherever you live. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1624376507752755202))
