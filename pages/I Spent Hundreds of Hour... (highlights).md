	- I spent hundreds of hours figuring out how to organize high-growth teams in @NotionHQ
	  
	  The goal is to enable groups of people to ship high-quality work without too much process.
	  
	  Here are three essential things:
	  
	  1. Knowledge STRUCTURE
	  2. Top-down PLANNING 
	  3. Botton-up EXECUTION ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/optemized/status/1572731595714605063))

	- Knowledge Structure
	  
	  Decide what are the smallest units at your org? Generally, it's tasks, docs, and meetings.
	  
	  Figure out what contextual data does your team need to do their job? Usually, it's people, companies, and research. 
	  
	  How does it all connect to each other?

	- Top-down Planning 
	  
	  Once a quarter, outline goals and projects.
	  
	  Once a month, revisit them to make sure that your team is aligned.
	  
	  Once a week, plan out strategy, tasks, and check-in to move each project forward.
	  
	  Then, just do it. 
	  
	  (Making sure it's all related)

	- Bottom-up Execution
	  
	  If you've done the planning right, today's work should be clear.
	  
	  Open up your dashboard, mute notifications and go after it :)

	- All of this thinking is baked into HiveMind
	  
	  It's a Notion template on steroids that we're launching in 13 days.
