	- The Most Common Mistakes in Charts and Data Presentation
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Simplicity is the biggest flaw in charts and data presentations made today., * Researchers should use conventional graphics that are in the best pay, and specify them in advance.)

	  So let me, let me, if it's okay, get down to some nitty gritty, because I do want to make sure that every listener to the podcast comes away making slightly better charts than they did coming in. I mean, we live in a world where there's graphics and data visualization all over the place. This is probably an unfair question, but what do you think is the biggest flaw or the most common mistake in how people make charts and present their data these days?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Simplicity. Okay. They try five times, five different graphics or maybe 10. They have a programmer. It does us something special and they cherry pick the results. And my first piece of advice to any researcher is use utterly conventional graphics that are in the very best pay, very best graphics in your field. And you specify those graphics in advance. You can't search through, you can't cherry pick things are so bad that in medical research in the clinical trials, RCTs, randomized trials, they have to specify their graphics before they see the data. Wow. Because everybody was cheating. Jerry Vicki, because most everybody is doctor confirmation bias. ([Time 0:21:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/36fd1049-93c2-4e5b-a9ef-0a0a562d04d2))
	- The Six Page Counterpoint
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* PowerPoint can be used to improve the cognitive style of a presentation, which can give a presentation an order of magnitude competitive advantage., * The main way to improve the cognitive style of a presentation is to use sentences instead of bullets, and to start the presentation with a handout that uses sentences.)

	  That's very interesting because I know that you've said you've criticized PowerPoint before very trenchantly. And I'll confess, I use PowerPoint all the time when I give talks. But I guess I would never think to use it to sort of share information as text that makes documents. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I had a wonderful thing happen very early on about PowerPoint, which I didn't hear about until 15 years later. So the PowerPoint essay comes out and it has a Columbia and that's among other things. And it was called the cognitively style of PowerPoint. And it had a picture of Stalin giving a talk. And the people down below, you know, all the soldiers were down below making remarks about his bad PowerPoint. And somebody read that essay before it was published and said, why don't you say what you should do instead of just saying, you know, bad PowerPoint? And I first I got kind of shy. I said, my job's not to rescue PowerPoint. And I thought, well, but I should rescue my audience, my people. And so I wrote one page, which is every meeting should begin with a handout that uses sentences. Two to six pages using sentences, no bullets. And every meeting begins with a 30 minute reading period.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Boom.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  And it's how I taught. They confused Ivy League undergraduates, but we actually had to think in class in class. Oh my goodness. In class, we had to think that was yes, they were used to scrub. They were very good at scribbling notes, but they had. And so if I had a proof on the board, I would pass the proof out. So they didn't have to take notes and then they can annotate how I got from step three to step four, you know, marked that up. And so they weren't in doing stenography anymore. So a few months after that came out, Jeff Bezos and his direct assistant were flying, reading aloud my essay on PowerPoint. And they saw that set of sentences, six pages, and they immediately had not put it throughout the counterpoint. And the highest level decision making was made by the, there was no presentation. There was no rehearsal or no slide. There was the six, six page here. People can read that faster than you can talk. And so I have my courses. People got all five books and there was reading all during the class. I'm in talk a lot too, but we would stop and read these two pages and I'd talk about it. So on. And so it was back and forth of them reading different mode. And they could read, they could skip things later on. So you would slide, everybody has the same slide at once and it's controlled by the, but with reading, everybody in the room can use their own priorities and their own sense of relevance with that. And so all the work of preparation went into the report and a team might even do that six page here. And then they discussed it for an hour and a half. And he says, it gave us an enormous competitive advantage. And he said, they wrote about this 15 years later. It gave us a tremendous competitive advantage, an order of magnitude competitive advantage. ([Time 0:43:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4ca20b1d-c88c-477c-8cb9-ce8d073b620c))
