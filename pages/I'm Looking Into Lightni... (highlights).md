	- I'm looking into lightning and I have Qs
	  
	  1. Why don't we harvest lightning energy?
	  It sounds like we could, but don't. Why?
	  
	  It was mostly tried in the US, but lightning happens around the equator
	  
	  There's not much on Google

	- 2. One of the main issues is lack of predictability of where lightning falls. But there's a place on Earth where we know! Lake Maracaibo, where there's lightning 50% of the days
	  
	  Has anybody tried there?

	- BTW crazy why that has the highest density of lightning in the world: It's a funnel for hot air coming from the Caribbean, but it hits mountains on all sides, forces the warm air up, and BAM, lightning!

	- 3. Does really NOBODY know how lightning forms?!
	  
	  Yes, warm, moist water raises, hits cold air with crystals, and their friction extracts electrons.
	  
	  But why do these electrons go down, not up, causing the lower part of a cloud to charge negatively?
	  
	  Anybody knows? https://t.co/ms45iWHy1s ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1624112090620231692))
