	- I've spent an obscene amount of time trying to figure out the right TfT (Tools for Thoughts) stack for ME.
	  
	  My curiosity led me to explore 10+ TfT tools, but at the end of the day, I was just trying to solve 3 major pain points. 
	  
	  And here is where I landed as of TODAY.

	- A little bit about what is important for me - 
	  â€¢ I'm looking for a "functional minimum structure" that helps me to get shit done
	  â€¢ I have a hectic schedule and a fragmented mind, so having a powerful quick-capture tool is important

	- I choose my tools to solve 3 of my main pain points -
	  
	  1. Quick capture + shallow processing
	  2. Deep thinking + facilitate connections between unstructured data/ideas
	  3. Structured workflow to collaborate with my future self or a team ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JessicaShieh/status/1418861469274312704))

	- Disclaimer 1: 
	  The TfT space is constantly changing, I expect my stack to change over time.
	  
	  However, it is a good idea to revisit and focus on the fundamental processes, workflows and results you wanted to achieve. 
	  
	  Great thread by @maggied on the topic. https://t.co/garXm5b3ga ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JessicaShieh/status/1418861472671703040))

	- There is no perfect tool. Beware of the "shiny toy syndrome."
	  
	  That said, I'm still very curious about YOUR shiny toys lol.
	  
	  â€¢ What workflow/result are you trying to achieve?
	  â€¢ What are your remaining pain points?
