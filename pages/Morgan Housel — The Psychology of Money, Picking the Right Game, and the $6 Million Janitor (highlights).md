	- Sometimes peace of mind matters more than profit. [1:33:44]
	- What has been true for decades that will stop working, but will drag along stubborn adherence because it has such a long track record of success? [2:43:50]
	- “If your tolerance for bullshit is zero, you’re not going to make it at all in life.”— Morgan Housel
	- “You have to have a level of savings in your asset allocation that doesn’t make sense. You have to have a level of conservatism that seems like it’s a little bit too much. That’s the only time that you know that you are prepared for risks that you cannot envision.”— Morgan Housel
	- “A fine means you did something wrong like, ‘Shame on you, here’s your speeding ticket. Don’t do it ever again. You’re in trouble.’ And a fee is just a price of admission that you paid to get something better on the other side. Like you go to Disneyland, you pay the fee, and then you get to enjoy the theme park. You didn’t do anything wrong, it’s just that’s the fee.”— Morgan Housel
	- “Risk is just the odds that something will prevent you from achieving your goals. But the nuance is that everyone has very different goals and aspirations and time horizons.”— Morgan Housel
	- “You and I, and everyone else, and the smartest people that we know have no clue what’s going to happen over the next 10 years. That’s always been true and I think it always will be true.”— Morgan Housel
