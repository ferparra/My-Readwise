	- Is There a Difference Between the Extremes and the Individual Responses?
	  
	  Summary:
	  "I don't think you're going to take some one like myself, who's athletically quite average. I don't think any amount of training as going make me elete in anything." "We've published a little bit on this topic about the measurements that we have aren't typically good enough," he says. 'That would require a very, very good instrument'

	  And you've sort of already touched on it a bit, but do we have data to suggest how malleable that is? You know, we all know the extremes, right? Like we know these sort of mesamorphic specimens that kind of look at weights and get bigger and stronger. And then conversely, we know that sort of wiry person who can't put on muscle no matter what they seemingly do. But boy like you get them out there on a bike, and you could never catch them. But when you take some one, maybe who's not quite at the extremes, how much can training and over what time period, impact fibre type?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I think certainly some. I don't think you're going to take some one like myself, who's athletically quite average. I don't think any amount of training as going make me elete in anything. But i do think that i could improve certain aspects of that, for sure, but i don't think it's going to, myself, move me to up a couple notches. Now, there could be some people who certainly can. I think that this is where there's quite a bit of confusion with individual response data and things like that. We've published a little bit on this topic about the measurements that we have aren't typically good enough to say, not only did this group increase muscle size more than this group, but this individual increase more than this person, but not quite as much as this person and not quite as much as this person. That would require a very, very good instrument. So i think people often take that mean, so you're saying that there aren't individual responses. I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying that we may not have the ability to appropriately determine who's who. We can say, over all, on average, doing this will increase this or that. But i think that, just looking around, it seems at least pretty clear to me that there are some people who you give them a certain and man, do they look like world beaters a couple months later. So that does tell me something is different about them, but i don't know that we could detect that with a lot of the measurements that we have.
