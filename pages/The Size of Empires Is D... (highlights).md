	- The size of empires is determined by transportation technology: The borders can't be beyond 1 month of travel from the capital
	  
	  1. The Roman Empire
	  Left: Roman conquests over time
	  Right: The time it took to travel from Rome to different places

	- 2. Egypt
	  • Deserts were impenetrable
	  • Not enough forests (wood) for a Mediterranean fleet
	  • Only the Nile could be traveled
	  • Nile travel was stopped by the 1st cataract
	  ➡️the Egyptian kingdom was just the Nile between the Med and the 1st cataract

	- As kingdoms reduced the time to pass cataracts, they could expand a bit further.
	  Egypt eventually reached the 2nd cataract, while Kerma was between the 2nd and 4th

	- At its largest extent, as the kingdom improved its communications from the capital (always at the head of the Nile's delta), Egypt was able to travel upstream and on the coast

	- 3. Achaemenid Empire
	  It was the first to build long-distance roads. Without them, it couldn't have controlled so much territory.
	  Its borders were also within ~1 month of the capital

	- 4. China
	  China's heart is the plain between the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. But these rivers don't cross each other. The result was constant wars between the civilizations from each river
	  
	  That's why Chinese rulers built canals to connect them *in the 5th century BC*!

	- 5. Atlantic
	  Crossing the Atlantic was not viable until the Portuguese discovered key technologies like the Volta de Mar or the Caravel

	- The trip from Portugal to Brazil and from Spain to the Caribbean took about a month, while the trip from Portugal to its colonies in the Indian Ocean took several months. That's a key reason why they kept their American colonies much longer than most of their Asian ones ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1611153779465895937))
	- Just before the Independence War, it took more than one month in standard conditions to sail from England to the US, making the split unavoidable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1611153780921229314))
	- 6. Incas
	  The Inca empire had 40,000 km of unpaved roads for its chasqui runners who could go from the capital Cuzco to the final frontier in 14 days.

	- 7. Russia
	  The only reason why it could conquer and hold Siberia for so long was because the environment was too hostile  for a big local population. The trip from Moscow to the Pacific took many months when these regions were occupied

	- But the moment Russia felt threatened by Japan, it built the Trans-Siberian at breakneck speed, and completed the year the war broke. It cut the travel time from Moscow to Vladivostok to 10 days or so. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1611153786378108928))
	- You could conquer land beyond 1 month, but you couldn't keep it for long
	  
	  Alexander the Great reached India, but its empire split in at his death
	  
	  The Mongols conquered everything from Mongolia to Eastern Europe, but the empire split in 4 within 2 decades of its biggest extent

	- Why does this matter today?
	  
	  1. We don't realize that, up till very recently, political units were driven by hidden forces like transport tech
	  
	  Now that transport tech can get you anywhere in the world in less than 1 month, empires could be global if it weren't for other forces ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo/status/1611153790060711936))
	- 2. Earth countries will be able to keep colonies on the moon (3d travel), but not on Mars (~6m travel)
