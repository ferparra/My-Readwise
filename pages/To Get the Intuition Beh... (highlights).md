		- **Note**: Thread
	- For Linear Algebra: Topics include Vector spaces, Matrix vector operations, Rank of a matrix, Norms, Eigenvectors and values and a bit of Matrix calculus too.

	- Bonus 2: This is a really nice reference book to Matrix calculus, has things like what is the gradient of an matrix's inverse or its determinant  and so on.
