	- 1/8
	  
	  I'm going to need an explainer on the Crypto .com cold wallet set up?
	  
	  Decided to poke at wallet 4 on Etherscan and here is what I saw:

	  Nearly all of its inflows are from pass through addresses that only ever received from an exchange or another wallet that was dex trading.

	  Then sometimes it was passed to another cold wallet directly

	  But sometimes it went through contract addresses than Nansen lists as deposit addresses?
	  
	  Each one of which was created 71 days ago?

	  Why would the majority of cold funds come directly from exchanges, into a few addresses?
	  
	  Why would a cold wallet ever need to send to another cold wallet through a deposit contract? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1591632050649722880))

	  Then to make matters worse, why is that cold wallet sending to Gate, Binance, Huobi and Deribit?
	  
	  Like this tx 3 days ago sending 1500 ETH directly to Deribit:

	  Are these wallets cold or hot?
	  
	  And why is it only really exchange transfers?
	  
	  Could this be a legit setup? Maybe.
	  
	  But it's certainly unorthodox, and should be explained given the weird transactions that people pointed out tonight. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1591632061416218624))
	- 8/8
	  
	  Why the exchange flows here?
	  
	  What's the structure?
	  
	  Where are the Cronos chain stables held?
	  
	  It should be easy to work with the community and provide clarity here especially after just say you accidentally moved user funds. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1591632065207963651))
