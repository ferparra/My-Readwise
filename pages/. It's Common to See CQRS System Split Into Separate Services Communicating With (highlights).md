	- most systems CQRS adds risky complexity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpbv0fpww9wv6gy1kv7enzp))
	- The mainstream approach people use for interacting with an information system is to treat it as a CRUD datastore. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpbtpmfmky4gt4ep3g2gzjv))

	- Developers typically build their own conceptual model which they use to manipulate the core elements of the model. If you're using a Domain Model, then this is usually the conceptual representation of the domain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpbwqzw6wppf8j3qgct9b19))
	- The change that CQRS introduces is to split that conceptual model into separate models for update and display, which it refers to as Command and Query respectively following the vocabulary of [CommandQuerySeparation](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CommandQuerySeparation.html).

	- As we move away from a single representation that we interact with via CRUD, we can easily move to a task-based UI. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpbywyh9ag8w92exjsbgc3n))
	- CQRS fits well with [event-based programming models](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventNarrative.html). It's common to see CQRS system split into separate services communicating with [Event Collaboration](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventCollaboration.html). This allows these services to easily take advantage of [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html/../eaaDev/EventSourcing.html). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpbz2jhtezcgjxy7jzycj5v))
	- Having separate models raises questions about how hard to keep those models consistent, which raises the likelihood of using [eventual consistency](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/12/eventually_consistent.html). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpbznvd0mghek2cyn5jgfxc))
	- In particular CQRS should only be used on specific portions of a system (a [BoundedContext](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html) in DDD lingo) and not the system as a whole. In this way of thinking, each Bounded Context needs its own decisions on how it should be modeled. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpc0c2415bsb8vfqv8tqhgm))
