	- Here is a probabilistic puzzle.
	  
	  Feedex and Acme are two delivery companies. Feedex trains are 80% on time, while only 40% of its trucks are.
	  
	  However, Acme's trains are 100% on time, and 60% of its trucks are as well.
	  
	  Yet, Feedex is more reliable! Why?

	- As Acme dominates reliability in both categories, it seems like a better choice.
	  
	  However, something is missing from the picture. What do you think it is?

	- To find out the true reliability, we need the proportion of delivery vehicles used per company.
	  
	  It turns out that Feedex leans more on their trains! This is good news, as their trains are more likely to be on time.

	- As
	  
	  • the 80% (trains on time) of 80% (proportion of trains) is 64%,
	  • and the 40% (trucks on time) of 20% (proportion of trucks) is 8%,
	  
	  the chances of a Feedex package arriving in time is 64% + 8% = 72%. https://t.co/RmiRLPl5qV ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TivadarDanka/status/1646101147370033153))
	- What about Acme? Unfortunately, they rely mostly on trucks in an 80%-20% ratio. Thus, as
	  
	  • the 100% (trains on time) of 20% (proportion of trains) is 20%,
	  • and the 60% (trucks on time) of 80% (proportion of trucks) is 48%,
	  
	  Acme's overall reliability is only 20% + 48% = 68%.

	- To sum up, Feedex is on time 72% of the time, while Acme is on time only 68% of the time. This result is quite surprising, given that Acme is better in each category.
	  
	  The lesson: probabilistic thinking can bring in huge gains.

	- The above technique works because of the so-called sum rule, the cornerstone of probabilistic thinking.
