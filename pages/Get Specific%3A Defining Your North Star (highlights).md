	- When converging on your North Star Metric and Inputs, consider the following questions:
	  
	  1.  How will changes in this metric impact your decision-making? What decisions are you hoping to inform? If you have historical data, "try on" the various changes in the metric over the months or years.
	  2.  What doesn’t this metric tell you? Are any of those questions or uncertainties more important to address?
	  3.  Assume that all product development activities stopped. Would the metric increase? For how long? Why?
	  4.  In his talk, "Performance… It’s for People!," Web Performance Consultant Andy Davies argues that, "Your analytics are skewed. They’re biased towards visitors who’ll tolerate the experience you’re delivering." How does your chosen metric account for this?
	  5.  Will you eventually be able to generate this metric continuously or frequently with minimal effort?  
	    How is the metric affected by seasonality, day-of-the-week, and day-of-the-month effects?
	  6.  Is it possible (and helpful) to compare this metric across various account and user cohorts? Ideally, there is value in viewing it in isolation and across cohorts.
	  7.  What will be your signal to revisit this metric? Assuming you revisit it periodically, what tests will you run to determine that it is still useful? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbwxxdrnj90h30mjvmg068r))

	- Input Test 1: The Greenfield Test
	  
	  For this test, forget about current roadmaps, missions, or other restrictions. Instead, focus on generating new ideas. Pose this question to the team:
	  
	  *"How many opportunities can you come up with in two minutes to influence this Input?"*
	  
	  You can use this format:
	  
	  *We have an opportunity to improve [an Input] if we could [some change in behavior, outcome]. Potential interventions we might try to exploit that opportunity include [features, experiments, etc.].* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbwyvpx4swj6kbqe9744v57))
