document_note:: The Little Book of Bull's Eye Investing by John Mauldin argues that an investor should focus on understanding where the markets are going and not where they've been in order to be successful. Looking at cycles in terms of valuations is one of the keys to Bull's Eye Investing. It is important to target investments to where the market is going, buy value, set stop loss orders and price targets, and be patient. It is also important to understand why an investment will make money, and to be aware of the fact that there is much more knowledge required than what can be found in the book. The book also argues that in secular bull markets, an investor should search for assets that offer relative returns, and in secular bear markets, the investor should focus on absolute returns. Additionally, it is important to note where in the stock cycle one is, and to remember that the stock market does not grow faster than the economy over the long term. The book also offers advice on buying gold, which is a neutral currency, and on investing in real estate.
