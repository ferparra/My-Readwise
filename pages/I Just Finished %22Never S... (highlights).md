	- I just finished "Never Split The Difference" by @fbinegotiator. Given that Product Managers live almost all their working lives leading indirectly & trying to influence others, I strongly recommend you add this to your reading list! 
	  
	  Here are some key takeaways: ðŸ‘‡

	- Chris Voss was an FBI negotiator turned business negotiation consultant. Many of the stories in the book involve hostages and the kind of super-high-stress situations that hopefully we privileged office workers never need to worry about, but we can apply many of his lessons: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/onejasonknight/status/1609531896924442630))
	- 1. Negotiation is not a battle, it's a discovery process
	  
	  Develop empathy & use techniques like active listening, mirroring, being intentional with the voice you use (radio DJ, playful, assertive), preparing for surprises & pivoting where necessary. It's like product discovery! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/onejasonknight/status/1609531899101184003))
	- 2. Label their responses
	  
	  Don't just nod and agree, but label their responses ("It seems like..., It looks like...") to make sure you show you understand them and give them something to agree with (or push back against). Pre-empt barriers in an "accusation audit" & call them out ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/onejasonknight/status/1609531900850278400))
	- 3. Give them permission to say "No"
	  
	  People will say "Yes" to get rid of you. Removing the ability to say "No" can introduce stress & make them feel defensive. "No" is the beginning of the negotiation, and consider asking them a question that invites a "No" to put them at ease ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/onejasonknight/status/1609531902632812546))
	- 4. "That's right" are the two best words 
	  
	  "You're right" is awful because it puts the responsibility on you. It sounds like an agreement but may not lead anywhere. "That's right" means they've thought about it, internalised it and are more likely to take action off of it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/onejasonknight/status/1609531904419631106))
	- 5. Use [[cognitive biases]] to your advantage
	  
	  We all have them, and you're up against cognitive biases all the time. But use biases like [[loss aversion]], [[reciprocity bias]], [[anchoring]] etc to help frame the negotiation in ways that are favourable to you ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/onejasonknight/status/1609531906504146944))
	- 6. Look for Black Swans
	  
	  There are always unknown unknowns in negotiations. Maybe they are ill-informed, constrained or have competing interests. Try to understand these and use techniques to work them out as best you can. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/onejasonknight/status/1609531908316176386))
	- There's a lot more in this book, and I definitely recommend checking it out. I don't want to hear anyone complaining about having trouble with stakeholder requests until you've tried some of this stuff!
