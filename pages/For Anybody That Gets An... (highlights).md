	- For anybody that gets anxiety/FOMO about their ever-expanding list of: 
	  
	  -books to read
	  -shows to watch
	  -video games to play. 
	  
	  I found this to be really freeing:
	  
	  "Treat your 'To-Read' pile like a river, NOT a bucket." -@oliverburkeman
	  
	  Here's what he means: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SteveKamb/status/1616460004789477377))

	- @oliverburkeman If we think of our to-read/watch/play lists as a bucket, we feel anxiety that we're not emptying it faster. 
	  
	  The problem: we'll NEVER empty it. There's too much good stuff to consume.
	  
	  Instead, it's a stream that flows past, from which you pluck a few items, here and there. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SteveKamb/status/1616460466813034496))
	- We don't feel bad about all the books in a library we haven't read, right?
	  
	  It's only books in our "to read" folder on our Kindle or our "to watch" Netflix queue that stress us out
	  
	  We can let go.
	  
	  (Says the nerd with 117 books in his "current" Kindle folder & 150 in "to read") ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SteveKamb/status/1616461244067885057))
	- In the immortal words of Gureni Telsij of the Rebel Alliance:
	  
	  "There's too many of them!"
	  
	  There are too many great shows. Too many amazing books. Too many incredible video games. 
	  
	  We'll never ever ever get to them all. 
	  
	  We can let ourselves (and our queue) off the hook. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SteveKamb/status/1616469673629093889))
