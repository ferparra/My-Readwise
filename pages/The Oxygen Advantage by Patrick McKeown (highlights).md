document_note:: The Oxygen Advantage by Patrick McKeown details the importance of increased oxygenation to improve health and fitness. The main obstacle to this is chronic overbreathing, which is determined by the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood. To counteract this, the author recommends holding the breath until the first urge to breathe is felt, and then resuming nasal breathing. He also suggests different exercises to improve oxygenation, such as nose unblocking and breathing recovery. The key is to reduce breathing volume by feeling as if you would like to take in a bigger breath, without tensing the chest or abdomen muscles.
