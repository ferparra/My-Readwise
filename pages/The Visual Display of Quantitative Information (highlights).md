document_note:: The Visual Display of Quantitative Information is a book about graphical excellence, which is a combination of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency. It discusses principles such as maximizing data-ink ratio, erasing non-data-ink and redundant data-ink, and revising and editing. Additionally, it provides aesthetic and technical advice for creating attractive displays of statistical information. Ultimately, the goal of the book is to provide guidance on how to effectively communicate information through visual displays.

	- Excellence in statistical graphics consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency. Graphical displays should:
	  
	  1.  show the data
	  2.  induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about methodology, graphic design, the technology of graphic production, or something else
	  3.  avoid distorting what the data have to say
	  4.  present many numbers in a small space
	  5.  make large data sets coherent
	  6.  encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data
	  7.  reveal the data at several levels of detail, from a broad overview to the fine structure
	  8.  serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation, or decoration
	  9.  be closely integrated with the statistical and verbal descriptions of a data set ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq75x1bbrhhn8bh420e6vyw))
	- Graphical integrity is more likely to result if these 6 principles are followed:
	  
	  1.  the representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graphic itself, should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented
	  2.  clear, detailed, and thorough labeling should be used to defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity. Write out explanations of the data on the graphic itself. Label important events in the data.
	  3.  show data variation, not design variation
	  4.  in time-series displays of money, deflated and standardized units of monetary measurement are nearly always better than nominal units
	  5.  the number of information-carrying (variable) dimensions depicted should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data
	  6.  graphics must not quote data out of context ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq763363rwr0ex9at8mx5mq))
	- Five principles in the theory of data graphics produce substantial changes in graphical design. The principles apply to many graphics and yield a series of design options through cycles of graphical revision and editing
	  
	  1.  Above all else, show the data
	  2.  Maximize the data-ink ratio
	  3.  Erase non-data-ink
	  4.  Erase redundant data-ink
	  5.  Revise and edit ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq767ewsbn291fpxw133zp5))
	- Well-designed small multiples are:
	  
	  1.  inevitably comparative
	  2.  deftly multivariate
	  3.  shrunken, high-density graphics
	  4.  usually based on a large data matrix
	  5.  drawn almost entirely with data-ink
	  6.  efficient in interpretation
	  7.  often narrative in content, showing shifts in the relationship between variables as the index variable changes (thereby revealing the interaction of multiplicative effects) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq76bd6130c6zz24tnm961b))
	- Small multiples reflect much of the theory of data graphics:
	  
	  1.  for non-data-ink, less is more
	  2.  for data-ink, less is a bore ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq76gf5g1s3930jm3945zjp))
	- Attractive displays of statistical information:
	  
	  1.  have a properly chosen format and design
	  2.  use words, numbers, and drawings together
	  3.  reflect a balance, a proportion, a sense of relevant scale
	  4.  display an accessible complexity of detail
	  5.  often have a narrative quality, a story to tell about the data
	  6.  are drawn in a professional manner, with the technical details of production done with care
	  7.  avoid content-free decoration, including chartjunk ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq76kgdfgdbezqxjyrzcsvc))
