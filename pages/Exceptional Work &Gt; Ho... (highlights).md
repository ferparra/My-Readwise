	- Exceptional work > Hours worked. 
	  
	  In studies, when great work is done, managers couldn't tell the difference between employees who *actually* worked 80 hrs/week, and those who just pretended to. 
	  
	  They even got promoted at the same rates. Here are 3 important takeaways... 1/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1505865203879190533))

	- Finding 1: Seeming like you “can’t handle the hours” gets you penalized. 
	  
	  People who were candid with their boss about wanting a more balanced schedule were not seen positively. 
	  
	  They also weren’t getting promoted. 2/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1505865206307729418))
	- Finding 2: If the work was solid, managers didn’t even notice when people didn’t put in the hours. 
	  
	  Those who secretly started to go to their kids soccer games, ski, & adjusted their schedules (but told no one) were seen as “superheroes” in their work. 
	  
	  Praised & Promoted. 3/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1505865208060854275))
	- Finding 3: Taking “formalized” routes of adjusting your schedule will burn you. 
	  
	  Women were most likely to take the formal approach - reducing hours proactively with their company, or taking a step down in role. This strategy didn’t pay off. 
	  
	  No promotions or praise here. 4/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1505865209830948865))
	- The groups promoted equally were:
	  1. Those “perceived” to work 80 hr weeks, and 2. Those that actually did. 
	  But there was no difference. 
	  
	  The quality of the work wasn’t the issue - it was the perception of hours worked & all the things leaders assign to that. 5/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1505865211999313921))
	- Think this week: Is perception of hours invested more important than the caliber of work at your company? 
	  
	  How are you assessing your team?
	  
	  Getting rewarded for “passing” as a worker that put in 80 hours per week, was fascinating. 6/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1505865213668732933))
	- Here’s a great write up of one of the studies that inspired the thread. 
	  
	  Hard workers want to rise, but not all of them want work to overtake every aspect of their life.
	  
	  Rewarding the right things matters. 
	  Value the work over hours. 7/fin
