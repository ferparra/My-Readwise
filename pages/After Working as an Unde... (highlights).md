	- After working as an understudy @jackbutcher for a month, I have learned a lot. 
	  
	  I have also just completed both courses.
	  
	  Today, I am going to reflect on some of the biggest lessons I took away from @visualizevalue's "Build Once, Sell Twice." 
	  
	  Time for a thread ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/EfPvmz8wSb
	- 1. What is value? 
	  
	  People often say provide value on Twitter, at its core, to create value, you can:
	  
	  Do things people don't do. (non-specific, $)
	  Do things people won't do. (specific, $$)
	  Do things people can't do. (ultra-specific, $$$)

	- 2. Different forms of value 
	  
	  Psychological Value: Improve feeling
	  Monetary Value: Making money
	  Functional Value: Make someone more competent 
	  Social Value: Make someone fit better 
	  
	  I realized I mainly aim to provide psychological and functional value https://t.co/Iwqpv8DS6a

	- 3. Patience 
	  
	  Compounding is the eight wonder of the world. 
	  
	  It affects:
	  
	  Your health
	  Your money
	  Your relationships
	  Your reputation
	  Your abilities
	  
	  Instead of losing money "gradually, then suddenly." You want to gain money that way. https://t.co/Doh9MPiC6d

	- 4. Iteration 
	  
	  "Become the best in the world at what you do, keep redefining what you do until this is true." -- @naval
	  
	  Your competence increases your perceived value.
	  
	  Your curiosity increases your ability to produce consistently.
	- 5. Tell a story 
	  
	  When we monetize our specific knowledge, we are tapping into an arbitrage opportunity in the market that nobody else has access to.
	  
	  You are not going to stand out by not sharing your story. 
	  
	  Stand out because of who you are.
	- The course has changed how I view my time and 10x'ed my podcast growth 
	  
	  I outsourced podcast editing, increased my listenership by 200% and am moving to Youtube as a new platform. 
	  
	  It has also helped me find direction on my personal brand. A powerful, reflective exercise! https://t.co/STpBNWwevd
	- The course is truly a transformative experience. 
	  
	  I know it is a big investment so I would love to talk with anyone that is looking to take it. 
	  
	  DM me and I would love to hop on a call to discuss your thoughts and situation!
