	- Introducing Decision Diffuser, a conditional diffusion model that outperforms offline RL across standard benchmarks â€“ using only generative modeling training! Decision Diffusers can also combine multiple constraints and skills at test-time.

	- By modeling a policy as a return conditional diffusion model, we illustrate how we may circumvent the need for dynamic programming and subsequently eliminate many of the complexities that come with traditional offline RL.

	- We further show benefits of Decision Diffuser by considering two other conditioning variables: constraints/skills. Conditioning on a constraint or skill during training leads to behaviors at test-time that can satisfy several constraints together or composition of skills.
