	- In December 2020, @nichlaswa and @thomaspaulmann started it  as part of our first hackathon ‚Äì codenamed "Supreme Octo Happiness".
	  
	  Here are early designs including a read-only mode, which you can think of as a better-looking GitHub Gist for sharing code snippets via links.

	- We built our initial version with @vuejs, but after releasing a React-based extensions API we shifted all web projects to @reactjs for tech stack simplification.
	  
	  In the meantime we addressed your feedback and added new themes.

	- We relied on Codemirror for editing, but version 6 made it harder to support a wide range of languages.
	  
	  Most people don't edit code in https://t.co/SaSrEmU7PH and simply copy-paste it, so we simplified our setup to solely rely on highlight.js. üòå

	- Time for some shoutouts:
	  üìö We adopted Jotai by @dai_shi to handle the global state for all configurations.
	  üñºÔ∏è We rebuilt our UI with @radix_ui to make it higher quality and more accessible.

	- Rewriting is an opportunity to add extra details and stand out: @r51 and @nichlaswa gave the window a native macOS look with an eye-catching border ü§§

	- So, what's next? We're working on server-side rendering using @vercel's Satori to make exporting images more efficient and stable. There are some performance issues with drop shadows to be solved.
	  
	  As always, send us your feedback!
