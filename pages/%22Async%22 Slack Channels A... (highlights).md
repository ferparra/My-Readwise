	- "Async" Slack channels are one of our secret weapons at @beondeck
	  
	  After using them for ~18 months, I can't imagine Slack without them. Particularly now— operating 100% remote with 62 teammates in 14 timezones.
	  
	  Here's the "how it works" post I use to open each new 1:1 channel 👇 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david__booth/status/1345205618458517504))

	- Welcome to our private "async" channel!! 👋👋
	  
	  Here's how it works —> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david__booth/status/1345205620266291200))
	- Anytime you need a quick response, e.g. "are you coming to this meeting?", use DM.
	  
	  A Slack DM is like a tap on the shoulder. It says "I need your attention now, please stop what you are doing." Use these sparingly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david__booth/status/1345205622447357954))
	- Anytime you're posting something more suited to asynchronous consideration and reply, post it here instead.
	  
	  Treat your post in the main channel like the subject line of an email, then thread *everything* else, including any links and images. The thread is your "email" body. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david__booth/status/1345205624338931713))
	- Sometimes it helps to add an emoji to the start of the "subject line" post, indicating the nature of the message. 
	  
	  E.g.
	  ❓ = question
	  💡 = idea
	  ℹ️ = fyi
	  🎉 = celebration fyi ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david__booth/status/1345205626272563201))
	- Before starting a new thread, do a quick "cmd + F" search to see if we've already discussed the topic.
	  
	  If so, you can add to the original thread, "repost to channel", quote and/or merge in older threads (a bit like Twitter, I suppose) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david__booth/status/1345205629162377216))
	- Keeping each "subject line" to one sentence helps keep this channel easily scannable, particularly if we're parallel processing lots of topics
	  
	  You can also try pinning or saving threads, and adding emoji reactions, e.g.
	  
	  ☑️ = completed/closed
	  👀 = seen
	  ⏳ = waiting on something ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david__booth/status/1345205630844375040))

	- I recommend using Slack's “sidebar sections”, so you can keep all your async channels in one place, and collapse them to avoid being tempted by "bolded" channels.
	  
	  I aim to check async channels once or twice per day (same as my inbox, fwiw)
	  
	  Own your focus, don't break your flow.

	- We can also use this space to share “high bandwidth” video or voice updates asynchronously.
	  
	  Try posting a “subject”, then recording a quick @loom video/audio, or using the https://t.co/r9Mpkby2Y9 “VM bot”.

	- VM's are best for dense, context-rich updates. 
	  
	  Don't send VM's just because you can’t be bothered typing, that just offloads the work to the recipient to listen.
	  
	  Used effectively, async video/VM's can save us hours of meetings, and all sorts of other coordination pains. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david__booth/status/1345205646451376128))
	- We're always evolving this model, so let us know if you have any ideas or feedback! 
	  
	  Looking forward to working with you 📈💪💥 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david__booth/status/1345205648288452608))
