	- Construction on the World Trade Center began in 1968, but wasn’t delivered until 1971. The trouble was that when it did, New York barely needed a 60-story office building, let alone two 100-story towers.

Many at the time characterized the Twin Towers as “pure speculation.” As a result, office vacancies in Manhattan soared, tax revenues plummeted, and the city even flirted with bankruptcy.
