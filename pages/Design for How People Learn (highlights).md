document_note:: This document provides advice on how to create effective learning experiences by taking into account key principles of learning, memory, and attention. It covers topics such as setting a clear destination, identifying and bridging gaps, providing the right supplies for the journey, leveraging the learner's habits, making people the heroes of their own story, and creating job aids to support recall and recognition tasks. It also suggests ways to make learners feel capable, such as providing unexpected rewards, using social interaction, and giving them an inventory of the content. Finally, it emphasizes the importance of watching actual learners use the design in order to evaluate its success.

	- Identifying and Bridging Gaps
	  
	  1.  So when you are mapping out the route, you need to ask yourself what the journey looks like.
	    1.  Knowledge • What information does the learner need to be successful? • When along the route will they need it? • What formats would best support that?
	    2.  Skills • What will the learners need to practice to develop the needed proficiencies? • Where are their opportunities to practice?
	    3.  Motivation • What is the learner’s attitude toward the change? • Are they going to be resistant to changing course?
	    4.  Habits • Are any of the required behaviors habits? • Are there existing habits that will need to be unlearned?
	    5.  Environment • What in the environment is preventing the learner from being successful? • What is needed to support them in being successful?
	    6.  Communication • Are the goals being clearly communicated? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gstzkygbcdq36wabmec4t55v))
		- **Note**: Design for How People Learn involves identifying and bridging gaps in knowledge, skills, motivation, habits, environment, and communication in order to map out a successful learning journey. It requires understanding what information learners need, when they need it, and in which formats it should be presented in order to best support them. It also involves developing skills through practice, understanding the learner's attitude towards the change, unlearning existing habits and creating new ones, and addressing any environmental issues that may be preventing the learner from being successful. Finally, it requires making sure goals are clearly communicated.
	- Leveraging your learners as teachers. Intrinsically motivated learners are going to learn a lot on their own, and will learn even more if they share that knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gstzn96am4mvyne01qjd1ps0))
	- So when you are creating learning objectives, ask yourself: • Is this something the learner would actually do in the real world? • Can I tell when they’ve done it? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gstznh1myytb2w2z00pskv1d))
