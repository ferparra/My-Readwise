	- In 2004 I had an offer to join the new Kindle team at Amzn and I jumped at the oppty. I was on our retail team at the time -> Kindle was new/sexy. But a week before I was scheduled to start my new job, I was told to stay put and I learned an important lesson. Here’s the story:
	- 2 years earlier I had been given P&L responsibility for Amzn’s cell phone store. We sold phones + plans (like Car Warehouse and Best Buy). This was Amzn’s highest margin biz, but it was tiny and not growing and I was told it could get shut down. I had 6 mos to turn it around.
	- 18 months later, others starting copying us and growth stalled. When I got the offer to work on Kindle, I jumped at it. Not only would I have the chance to launch a new biz, I could walk away from my current biz and let someone else clean up the mess. But then...
	- Diego P. (WW head of retail) called me into his office. He explained you don’t get rewarded with new opportunities when you’re doing a bad job. He would allow me to join Kindle team, as soon as I got my current biz back on track and hired a successor who was stronger than me.
	- This was a tough message. Not only was my new opportunity on hold indefinitely, but it was also clear I was failing in my current role. I spent the next 6 months grinding on the biz and aggressively recruiting. I was able to re-accelerate growth and find a very strong successor.
	- Diego finally gave me permission to join the Kindle team. Steve Kessel had been holding my spot there, and I was determined to make up for lost time. As it turned out, we were still years away from launch and I hadn’t missed as much as I had feared.
	- A year earlier I had been on top of the world. I was running my own P&L, had performed a turnaround, everyone told me I was a rising star. Then things got hard and I tried to run away to a new job in a new dept. But great companies and strong leaders hold people accountable.
	- I never forgot this lesson, and I’ve often leaned on it when things get hard. It’s tempting to run away to something new (at work, in life). Resist that temptation - stay until your job is done, take pride in fixing what you broke, don’t hide from problems, act like an owner.
