document_note:: Naval Ravikant and Eric Jorgenson's "The Almanack of Naval Ravikant" is a collection of wisdom, advice and insight on topics such as wealth, health, happiness and more. The key takeaway is that it is best to do things for their own sake as it leads to higher quality work and less effort. Other forms of leverage such as products with no marginal cost of replication, like books, media, movies and code are discussed, as well as the importance of understanding the basics at a fundamental level and being able to falsify predictions. Lastly, it is important to focus on the direction of decisions over the amount of effort put in, and to recognize that no one can be better at being you than you are.

	- I only really want to do things for their own sake. That is one definition of art. Whether it’s business, exercise, romance, friendship, whatever, I think the meaning of life is to do things for their own sake. Ironically, when you do things for their own sake, you create your best work. Even if you’re just trying to make money, you will actually be the most successful. The year I generated the most wealth for myself was actually the year I worked the least hard and cared the least about the future. I was mostly doing things for the sheer fun of it. I was basically telling people, “I’m retired, I’m not working.” Then, I had the time for whatever was my highest valued project in front of me. By doing things for their own sake, I did them at their best. The less you want something, the less you’re thinking about it, the less you’re obsessing over it, the more you’re going to do it in a natural way. The more you’re going to do it for yourself. You’re going to do it in a way you’re good at, and you’re going to stick with it. The people around you will see the quality of your work is higher.

		- **Note**: Naval believes that if you do something just because you enjoy it, you will do your best work. Even if you are trying to make money, you will be more successful if you do things for the pure joy of them. One year, Naval worked less and didn't worry about the future, but he did things for fun instead. He found that when he did things for their own sake, he was able to do them better. He believes that if you don't want something too much, you won't obsess over it and you'll be more likely to do it in a natural way, which will allow you to do it better. People around you will notice the quality of your work. This is called effortless mastery.
	- The final form of leverage is brand new—the most democratic form. It is: “products with no marginal cost of replication.” This includes books, media, movies, and code. Code is probably the most powerful form of permissionless leverage. All you need is a computer—you don’t need anyone’s permission. Forget rich versus poor, white-collar versus blue. It’s now leveraged versus un-leveraged. The most interesting and the most important form of leverage is the idea of products that have no marginal cost of replication. This is the new form of of leverage. This was only invented in the last few hundred years. It started with the printing press. It accelerated with broadcast media, and now it’s really blown up with the internet and with coding. Now, you can multiply your efforts without involving other humans and without needing money from other humans.
	  
	  1.  *Leverage* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq806r2ayk4q8t44e2xfh7j))
		- **Note**: Leverage is a way to get things done without needing help from other people. This kind of leverage is new and very democratic. It includes books, movies, media, and code. Code is a special kind of leverage because all you need is a computer and you don't need anyone else's permission. Everyone can have this kind of leverage, regardless of their income or job. This kind of leverage has been around for a few hundred years, starting with the invention of the printing press. Now, with the internet and code, you can work on something and make it better without needing help from anyone else.
	- You have to put in the time, but the judgment is more important. The direction you’re heading in matters more than how fast you move, especially with leverage. Picking the direction you’re heading in for every decision is far, far more important than how much force you apply. Just pick the right direction to start walking in, and start walking.

		- **Note**: This passage means that it's important to use your best judgment when making decisions. It's more important to pick the right direction for each decision than it is to act quickly. You don't need to rush, but it's important to choose the right direction and start taking steps in that direction.
	- The really smart thinkers are clear thinkers. They understand the basics at a very, very fundamental level. I would rather understand the basics really well than memorize all kinds of complicated concepts I can’t stitch together and can’t rederive from the basics. If you can’t rederive concepts from the basics as you need them, you’re lost. You’re just memorizing. The advanced concepts in a field are less proven. We use them to signal insider knowledge, but we’d be better off nailing the basics.

		- **Note**: "Smart people are clear thinkers. They really understand the most important ideas. It's better to understand the important ideas really well than to memorize a lot of complicated facts that you can't remember or use. If you don't know the important ideas, you won't be able to figure out how to use the facts you know. Memorizing facts is not enough. The more advanced ideas in a subject are not as sure, so it's better to focus on understanding the basics first."
	- Mental models are really just compact ways for you to recall your own knowledge. I think a lot of modern society can be explained through evolution. One theory is civilization exists to answer the question of who gets to mate. If you look around, from a purely sexual selection perspective, sperm is abundant and eggs are scarce. It’s an allocation problem. Literally all of the works of mankind and womankind can be traced down to people trying to solve this problem. Evolution, thermodynamics, information theory, and complexity have explanatory and predictive power in many aspects of life.

		- **Tags**: #[[mental models]]
		- **Note**: Mental models are like shortcuts to help you remember what you already know. A lot of the things that happen in the world today can be explained by looking at how people have changed over time. One idea is that people created cities and societies to figure out who should mate and have babies. We know that sperm is more plentiful than eggs, so it's a problem of figuring out how to divide them up. All of the things that people have created in the world, from technology to art, have come out of this problem. Evolution, thermodynamics, information theory, and complexity are all tools that help us understand life better.
	- To me, the principal-agent problem is the single most fundamental problem in microeconomics. If you do not understand the principal-agent problem, you will not know how to navigate your way through the world. It is important if you want to build a successful company or be successful in your dealings. It’s a very simple concept. Julius Caesar famously said, “If you want it done, then go. And if not, then send.” What he meant was, if you want it done right, then you have to go yourself and do it. When you are the principal, then you are the owner—you care, and you will do a great job. When you are the agent and you are doing it on somebody else’s behalf, you can do a bad job. You just don’t care. You optimize for yourself rather than for the principal’s assets.
	  
	  1.  *Microeconomics / Principal-Agent* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq7y2wv9z04fx5938cnnsx8))
		- **Note**: The principal-agent problem is a very important idea in microeconomics. It's like what Julius Caesar said: "If you want it done right, then you have to do it yourself." This means that when you are the owner and you care about the job, you will do a great job. But if someone else is doing it for you, they might not do a good job because they don't care as much. They might try to get the best result for themselves instead of for you.
	- Least understood, but the most important principle for anyone claiming “science” on their side—falsifiability. If it doesn’t make falsifiable predictions, it’s not science. For you to believe something is true, it should have predictive power, and it must be falsifiable. I think macroeconomics, because it doesn’t make falsifiable predictions (which is the hallmark of science), has become corrupted. You never have a counterexample when studying the economy. You can never take the US economy and run two different experiments at the same time.

		- **Tags**: #[[experimentation]]
		- **Note**: Falsifiability is an important part of science. It means that something can be tested and proven. To believe something is true, it needs to be able to predict what will happen and then be tested to see if it is correct. Macroeconomics doesn't have these tests, so it has become corrupted. You cannot do experiments with the US economy because there is no way to test different experiments at the same time.
	- No one in the world is going to beat you at being you. You’re never going to be as good at being me as I am. I’m never going to be as good at being you as you are. Certainly, listen and absorb, but don’t try to emulate. It’s a fool’s errand. Instead, each person is uniquely qualified at something. They have some specific knowledge, capability, and desire nobody else in the world does, purely from the combinatorics of human DNA and development. The combinatorics of human DNA and experience are staggering. You will never meet any two humans who are substitutable for each other.
	  
	  1.  *Permutations & Combinations* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq7v93d471xbd78xz1f3n1n))
		- **Note**: No one in the world is better at being you than you! Everyone is different and unique. Nobody can do things the same way as you can. Even if someone has similar knowledge, skills, and desires, they still won't be the same as you. That's because of something called permutations and combinations. That means that every person is made up of different pieces that make them special and unique.
	- The first thing to realize is you can observe your [[mental state]]. [[Meditation]] doesn’t mean you’re suddenly going to gain the superpower to control your internal state. The advantage of meditation is recognizing just how out of control your mind is. It is like a monkey flinging feces, running around the room, making trouble, shouting, and breaking things. It’s completely uncontrollable. It’s an out-of-control madperson…The ability to singularly focus is related to the ability to lose yourself and be present, happy, and (ironically) more effective. It’s almost like you’re taking yourself out of a certain frame and you’re watching things from a different perspective even though you’re in your own mind. Buddhists talk about awareness versus the [[ego]]. They’re really talking about how you can think of your brain, your [[consciousness]], as a multilayered mechanism. There’s a core-base, kernel-level OS running. Then, there are applications running on top. (I like to think of it as computer and geek speak.)

		- **Tags**: #[[meditation]]
		- **Note**: [[Meditation]] is a way of understanding how your mind works. It doesn't give you the power to control how you feel. Instead, it helps you see how you can't control everything in your head. It's like a monkey throwing poo, running around, making noise, and breaking things. It's totally out of control. Learning how to concentrate on one thing is related to learning how to be in the moment, be happy, and be more successful. It's like stepping back and looking at things from a different angle, even though you're still in your own head. People who study Buddhism talk about the differences between awareness and ego. They mean that your brain works like a machine with multiple layers. At the bottom is a basic operating system, and then there are programs running on top.
