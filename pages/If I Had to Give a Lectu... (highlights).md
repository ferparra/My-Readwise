	- If I had to give a lecture series on marketing, here's 11 points I'd include: 
	  
	  1. Data is like protein:
	  
	  It’s valuable - but it shouldn’t be your *only* input. 
	  
	  If all your decisions are guided by A/B tests, you’ll eventually end up with a porn site. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1428063893184827392))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 2. The infinite ROI skill stack: 
	  
	  A. Understand how people work - Lindy. 
	  
	  B. Understand platforms + culture - Ever-changing. 
	  
	  Live in the barbell. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1428063902148046851))
	- 3. The best marketers are open source for the *first time ever*
	  
	  • You can visit ad libraries 
	  • You can sign up to newsletters
	  • You can see the copy on their website
	  
	  There's no centralised database like Github - but it's there for the resourceful ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1428063910511403008))
	- 4. Copy or reverse-engineer 
	  
	  A. If you want to do good marketing, just copy the greats. 
	  
	  B. If you want to do great marketing, reverse engineer the principles behind great marketing. 
	  
	  Warning: You will then be copied. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1428063917918523393))
	- 5. Think with headlines first
	  
	  Mr. Beast has full time staff who's sole job is to write headlines for YouTube videos. 
	  
	  If the headline is good, they then make the video. 
	  
	  This is the inverse of making the headline fit the story. 
	  
	  Think of distribution before creation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1428063926776967176))
	- 6. The content barbell 
	  
	  The future of content is now shot on smartphones or high end Netflix-esque studios. 
	  
	  The middle is dying. 
	  
	  Hiring a Chief TikTok Officer is the highest leverage move in 2021. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1428063934486130690))
	- 7. The best marketing textbook is your bank balance. 
	  
	  Follow the money backwards from purchase to first hearing about. 
	  
	  It's proven to work by your actions. (Not words) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1428063943570886658))
	- 8. Unbundle Word of Mouth marketing 
	  
	  It’s now Word of WhatsApp, Word of Slack and Word of Discord. 
	  
	  Always ask: “How will people post about this in their group chat?” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1428063956334170115))
	- 9. If technical, try to learn in real time. 
	  
	  The landscape is ever-changing. 
	  
	  Avoid people teaching case studies that worked 2 years ago. 
	  
	  You want to see what they are doing live in real time - live streams, slack groups or weekly updates. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1428063965486125077))
	- 10. Find the highest leverage “Bakers Dozen” 
	  
	  Bakers Dozen = 13*
	  
	  *When the customer was expecting 12 
	  
	  It isn't the 13 that makes the customer happy - it's the unexpected +1
	  
	  Highest leverage = Largest +1 for customer
	  
	  Five Guys extra scoop of fries is the best example of this ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1428063974008971266))
	- 11. There's 2 kinds of people: 
	  
	  A. People who don't understand the scale of the internet 
	  
	  B. People who know they don't understand the scale of the internet
	  
	  Imagine the infrastructure you would need to do this in the physical world. https://t.co/g238dktFIS ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1428065540581568513))
