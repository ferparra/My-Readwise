document_note:: This document explores how to create effective visual displays of information, including strategies such as adding detail to clarify, micro/macro readings, small multiples, layering and separation, and narratives of space and time. It discusses the importance of designing for readers, avoiding chartjunk, and using appropriate colors, as well as the costs associated with producing quality visual displays.

	- A most unconventional design strategy is revealed: to clarify, add detail. Clutter and confusion are failures of design, not attributes of information. What we seek is not necessarily simplicity, but an understanding of complexity revealed with an economy of means
	  
	  1.  *Note: Shows some high level maps which become clearer as details such as trees, street names, and more are added* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq71nv0zwfs7k0vnna4hrcx))
		- **Note**: This passage is saying that when we design something, we should try to make it clear by adding more details. When something is too cluttered and confusing, it usually means that the design was not done well. Instead of trying to make something simple, we should try to find ways to show complex things in the most efficient way. For example, a map could look confusing at first, but adding more details like trees, street names, and more can make it much clearer.
	- Small Multiples
	  
	  1.  At the heart of quantitative reasoning is a single question: compared to what? Small multiple designs, multivariate and data bountiful answer directly by visually enforcing comparisons of changes, of the differences among objects, of the scope of alternatives. For a wide range of problems in data presentation, small multiples are the best design solution.
	  2.  Comparisons must be enforced within the scope of the eyespan, a fundamental point occasionally forgotten in practice ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq725wy8fx5eff5zprtycgq))
		- **Note**: Small multiples are designs that help us compare different pieces of information. They answer a single question: compared to what? Small multiples help us compare changes, differences between objects and a range of options. They are a good solution for showing data in a way that is easy to understand. We need to remember to compare information within the scope of what we can see.
