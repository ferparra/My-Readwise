	- Tip: 
	  Product GIFs are your best friend.
	  
	  Explanation: 
	  If you have a SaaS or DTC product, show don't tell. Give us action shots.
	  
	  Example:
	  @loom https://t.co/RQibD8lNbY ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725794063331333))
	- Tip: 
	  Make the H1 count.
	  
	  Explanation: 
	  Your H1 is the first (and most prominent) element we see right away. That first line of text is the difference between hooking them and losing them.
	  
	  Example:

	- Tip: 
	  Don’t be clever, be clear.
	  
	  Explanation: 
	  Those great puns you thought about for your headers? They probably won't convert well. Keep it super simple.
	  
	  Example: 
	  @veedstudio

	- Tip: 
	  Inject social proof in your copy.
	  
	  Explanation: 
	  Social proof isn't just logos. Find ways to showcase your success in the page copy.
	  
	  Example:
	  @ActiveCampaign 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0lMQgvXIAIhljm.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725808286126080))
	- Tip: 
	  Only use imagery that moves the story along.
	  
	  Explanation: 
	  If your product only needs words to describe it, don't use imagery "just because." Imagery should improve understanding.
	  
	  Example:
	  @wynter_com 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0lMQvqXoAQ251k.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725812635717638))
	- Tip: 
	  Increase site speed ASAP.
	  
	  Explanation: 
	  Speed can make or break a web experience. Use Pagespeed Insights to find opportunities for your site. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725813864599556))
	- Tip:
	  Video social proof wins.
	  
	  Explanation:
	  Testimonials are good. Video testimonials are next-level. They up your credibility and boost buyer confidence.
	  
	  Example:

	- Tip: 
	  Make it about the user.
	  
	  Explanation:
	  Don't talk about the brand. Talk about the user. Make the whole page copy and design cater to them.
	  
	  Example:
	  @whereby 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0lMRR4XoAc9kyF.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725821942833160))
	- Tip: 
	  1 CTA only (if possible.)
	  
	  Explanation: 
	  Limit CTAs to the bare minimum. The more actions you invite others to take, the fewer actions they will take.
	  
	  Example:
	  @gumroad 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0lMRhzWUAozKZc.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725825663127553))
	- Tip: 
	  Make it interactive.
	  
	  Explanation: 
	  Interactive elements work wonders. Use the features of your app in the design of the page to increase understanding.
	  
	  Example:
	  @JoinToucan 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0lMRveXMAE3ps0.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725829467357186))
	- Tip: 
	  Keep the home page focused.
	  
	  Explanation: 
	  Your home page is NOT your “everything” page. You shouldn't have all features, blogs, white papers, etc. on the home page.
	  
	  Example:
	  @figmadesign 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0lMR8pXsAQAwIo.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725833460342786))
	- Tip: 
	  Keep the overall design simple.
	  
	  Explanation:
	  Extra elements distract from the core purpose. The more you have on a page, the harder it is to maintain focus.
	  
	  Example:
	  @NotionHQ 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0lMSM_XEAICMYw.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725837587517443))
	- Tip: 
	  No buzzwords, just value props.
	  
	  Explanation:
	  Avoid fluffy buzzwords. Get to the point. Explain the benefits early, often, and clearly.
	  
	  Example:
	  @mailbrew 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0lMSbpWEAI1C23.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725841370853378))
	- Tip:
	  Create an ideal above the fold (ATF.)
	  
	  Explanation:
	  Menu, H1, Subheader, Button, and a tiny bit of social proof should all fit above the fold.
	  
	  Example:
	  @CleanShot 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0lMSq-XIAMrCDD.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725845812568070))
	- Tip:
	  CTAs should do exactly what they say.
	  
	  Explanation:
	  Don't get cute or clever with button copy. Don't be vague. Tell people exactly what happens when they click it.
	  
	  Example:
	  @super_ 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0lMS8MX0AQJjp0.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725850019446784))
	- Tip:
	  Make your pricing easily accessible.
	  
	  Explanation:
	  Don't hide pricing. Put it on a pricing page or the home page. Don't make people waste their time looking for valuable info.
	  
	  Example:
	  @TallyForms 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0lMTKJWEAkkavy.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725853731495936))
	- Tip: 
	  Delight with micro-interactions.
	  
	  Explanation:
	  Those subtle animations can make the experience of browsing a site more pleasant. It can put the user in a better mood and make them feel happier than before.
	  
	  Example:
	  @sayfloat https://t.co/HvavCNGulE ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725874115825665))
