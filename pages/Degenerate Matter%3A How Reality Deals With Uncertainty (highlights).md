	- A particle doesn’t have an exact location. It has some probability of having one position and some other probability of having another position (the collection of all these probabilities is called the probability distribution) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnqykk8n8c75vg1b2tfaj9nc))
	- change would be that instead of controlling the particle’s exact starting position and ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnqykyhstzjkyg0vea98jx7n))
	- In quantum mechanics, the position distribution and the momentum distribution are fundamentally linked. If you choose a position distribution, you are automatically choosing the momentum distribution. The two are linked in a way that if one distribution becomes too narrow, then the other distribution will get less narrow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnqyn9dvz1njrxyy125qkpek))
	- At the quantum level, many of the well-known particles (protons, neutrons, electrons) follow a similar rule known as the [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle). The specific rule is that two particles can’t occupy the same quantum state in the system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnqyts8zm50nxvhrkfgcsj4h))
	- the availability of quantum states matches our expectation of physical space in general: when there is more physical space available in a system, there are more quantum states available and where there is less physical space available, there are fewer quantum states available.

	- The gravity of the collapsing star generates so much pressure that all the protons and electrons inside the star combine to make neutrons. Eventually, it gets so small, that the Pauli exclusion principle becomes important and stops the star from collapsing further!

	- Particles that follow the Pauli exclusion principle are known as fermions. The particles that don’t are known as bosons. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnqz7efmnkqbdf13dzerpzmj))
	- Multiple bosons in a system can occupy the same energy state[4](https://azeemba.com/posts/degenerate-matter.html#fn:4). Since lower energy means lower momentum, we can use bosons to see what happens when the momentum probability distribution is made narrower (between 0 and the momentum allowed by the energy level).

	- In quantum mechanics, a lot of measurable quantities are not continuous–only specific discrete values are allowed. The same applies for angular momentum/rate of rotation which means that a quantum object can only rotate at specific rates. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnqzbzqcaayz00x33f22kj95))
