document_note:: In this podcast, Balaji Srinivasan discusses how the U.S. government's centralization of power has held back scientific progress and how open-style, decentralized funding can improve the scientific research and funding structure. He proposes implementing components of the venture capital model and removing the bureaucratic grant structure of academia. He also talks about the NYT-BTC-CCP triangle, artificial intelligence, the Helical Theory of History, and why we are at the beginning of digital history. Lastly, he explains how the media became the tip of the spear for the establishment and suggests that scientific content should be kept on a public blockchain.

	- The Helical Theory of History: Cycles play out in history, but generally there is progress ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtg5gvk95mmmvgw3h8bttgn1))
	- **The Helical Progress Theory of History**
	  
	  •   There are three theories of progress in history: linear, cyclical, and helical
	  •   Balaji subscribes to the **helical theory**, which acknowledges that cycles play out in history, but that there is generally **progress**
	  
	  •   **The internet may allows us to encrypt humanity**
	    •   People have never been more physically visible than they are today thanks to Google images and social media (we are at peak visibility)
	    •   People will fight back against the CCP-type surveillance state by using digital technologies and VR-overlays to shield their true identities with encryption ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtg5mx1z5389x7gg918f08jw))
		- **Note**: In this conversation, Balaji Srinivasan explores why the U.S. government is holding back scientific progress, how to fix the scientific research and funding structure, the media's role in the establishment, the "NYT-BTC-CCP triangle", artificial intelligence, the Helical Theory of History, and why we are at the beginning of digital history. Balaji suggests transitioning away from the centralized scientific establishment, implementing components of the venture capital model, and removing the bureaucratic grant structure of academia to improve the scientific research and funding structure. Open-style, decentralized funding is now an option for scientists and the scientific content can be kept on an immutable, public blockchain for traceability.
