	- Team values: attention to details, tech background, dealing with administrivia for them, smoothing over gaps between functions on individual projects, "scrappiness" 
	  Management values: solid communication/framing, relating back to business impact, solving x-team/x-org issues ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DanGrover/status/1362824495937949697))
	- I like the idea, in principle, of org-level mashups where PMs meet and present their roadmaps to each other (because we often don't have enough awareness of each others stuff), but it's exactly the kind of meeting that goes dead last in ranking of where to spend my attention.
