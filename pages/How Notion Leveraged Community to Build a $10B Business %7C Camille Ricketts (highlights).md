	  So I'd say that the community efforts that were very big for us were the ambassadors, also making sure that people were hosting in-person events. This really took off in 2019. Obviously we paused for 2020, 2021, but now I just spent time with Notion's head of community Ben Lang, who truly is the mastermind and genius behind so much of this. And he says that they're back up to 30 in-person events a month around the world. So that really helped on the international scale of spreading ubiquity and ended up lending itself to relationships with Station F in France, which is the biggest startup campus in Paris. So really helping us work our way into those types of networks. And then supporting those people to also start their own businesses and derive whatever reward they were looking for themselves. So we really wanted to align our goals with theirs. A lot of those folks actually started revenue generating businesses as consultants or course makers or influencers. Some of them just wanted to build their own platforms online. So all of our efforts there are like around building guides or counseling people one on one or making it easier for them to actually achieve those goals for themselves was also a big part of this growth. And then like I said influencers, this was something that Ben started exploring in 2019. And we were so pleasantly overwhelmed with the amount of traction and traffic that was driven by working with some of these influencers. And now that program has exploded into sort of an unmolty channel effort. That's huge for notion. ([TimeÂ 0:16:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6ff3eae4-07ba-4442-be26-f5a7fc6f55d3))
