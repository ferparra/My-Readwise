	- It is undeniable that lasting happiness and fulfillment comes from the first bucket, from their inner constitutions. External circumstances are worth relatively little because they are shaped by our experiences, thoughts, and ideas that shape the externalities and affect how we respond to them. It is what we are and not what we have that leads to lasting happiness ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsm3ggen2td8v2n45sk37vk5))
		- **Note**: This text argues that true and lasting happiness comes from within an individual, rather than from external circumstances. It is our inner constitutions and experiences, thoughts, and ideas that shape our externalities and affect our responses to them, ultimately leading to lasting happiness.
	- Excessive material wealth does little for happiness but we must be able to meet our needs or else we wonâ€™t have the luxury of time and space to focus on ourselves and what makes us really happy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsm3d4598mrzjbjxvnbx0m12))

	- The wise man aims for a life free from pain and annoyances and seeks one of leisure and quiet. The less wise a man is, the more apt he is to become bored for when he has nothing to do, his intellect does not turn on and he loses interest in everything around him.

		- **Note**: The wise person wants to live a life without hurt or troubles and looks for moments of rest and peace. If someone is not as wise, they are more likely to get bored because if they don't have anything to do, their mind won't be active and they won't care about anything around them.
