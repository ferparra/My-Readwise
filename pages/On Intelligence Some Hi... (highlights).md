	- ON INTELLIGENCE
	  
	  Some highlights from one of my top 3 favorite books, which describes the inner workings of the human brain and how we cannot learn without movement
	  
	  (more quotes below)

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ The brain learns through movement, temporal (eg, notes in a melody) and spatial (eg, features recognized by our fingers as we move them over an object)

	- 2/ This is how we predict what our senses might observe next

	- 4/ A fascinating fact about the brain

	- 5/ On the division of work in the brain. Note that all columns are nearly identical; what defines their function is their set of inputs.
	  
	  Just like if you hired two twins with identical skills and put them to work two different roles in your company

	- 6/ On the importance of discovering a good system to represent information

	- 7/ Again on the importance of reference frames.
	  
	  Last sentence is key.

	- 8/ And again on the importance of movement â€“ and why Ivory Tower experts can hardly exist, practice is required
	  
	  (and why I use roleplaying while teaching managers to be more effective people managers)

	- 9/ Anyway, I really recommend reading the first two thirds of this book (the last part is conjectural and I have some disagreements on it; yet, the core is ðŸ’¯, and the book is well worth a read or two).
