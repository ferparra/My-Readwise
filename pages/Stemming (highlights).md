	- In [linguistic morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_morphology) and [information retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval), **stemming** is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their [word stem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_stem), base or [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(linguistics)) formâ€”generally a written word form. The stem need not be identical to the [morphological root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphological_root) of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root. [Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) for stemming have been studied in [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) since the 1960s. Many [search engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine) treat words with the same stem as [synonyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym) as a kind of [query expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_expansion), a process called conflation.

	- A simple stemmer looks up the inflected form in a [lookup table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table). The advantages of this approach are that it is simple, fast, and easily handles exceptions. The disadvantages are that all inflected forms must be explicitly listed in the table: new or unfamiliar words are not handled, even if they are perfectly regular (e.g. cats ~ cat), and the table may be large. For languages with simple morphology, like English, table sizes are modest, but highly inflected languages like Turkish may have hundreds of potential inflected forms for each root.
