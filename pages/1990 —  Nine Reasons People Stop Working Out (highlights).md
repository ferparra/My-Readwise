	  So, you know, stressful events happen in your life. Exercise now use it as a way for stress relief or as a way to escape. Everything's going great, getting good sleep, got a good diet. Well, now I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go after it. I'm going to push myself and I'm going to have these great hard workouts. If you take your workout and think of it like a Swiss Army and I for something and you modify it, now it's something that you do all the time.

	  It's just wonderful tool that just makes your life better. You know, this reminds me of listening to Alex Hormosy talk about what he thinks about morning routines and the people that, you know, swear by these routines that they have. And he's like, I wish to battle the guy or girl who has got to have this routine in order for them to be successful at whatever they do. It's like, I'd much rather be adaptable and moldable. I'd rather be able to sleep on a concrete floor and get up the next day and steal crush work and not have to have had all these things aligned. I find that same thing when it comes to pursuing your health and fitness journey is being able to be moldable with what's currently happening in your life. And we're funny creatures like that. We finally find, you know, an orange theory class that we love and we love going to and it's on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays at this time. And it's like, all of a sudden you get a new job or a kid and that complete disrupts that. And then you just throw it out health and fitness because it doesn't work with your orange theory class. It's like, oh my God, are you kidding me? There's so much identity there. ([Time 0:23:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e7d4818e-b673-4b1c-8e1c-e66e00f5dc9c))
