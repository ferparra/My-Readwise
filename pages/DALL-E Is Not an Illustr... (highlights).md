	- DALL-E is not an illustration tool. It's a 3D rendering engine. 
	  
	  Its *learned* CGI techniques like ambient occlusion, drawing shadows, and reflections.
	  
	  It even uses environmental haze to enhance the perception of distance... like what!?

	- Look at the water – DALL-E can draw reflections on shiny surfaces. 
	  
	  Also a point light source illuminates sky haze – which *also* showing up in the reflection. 
	  
	  Most of these photos are from the renowned @nickcammarata.

	- Notice how the Teslas nearest to the "camera" are highly detailed. If you zoom in, the further cars literally just red blobs.
	  
	  It's learned to reduce the polygon count for distant models.

	- Damn this one is cool. 
	  
	  Ambient occlusion. Realistic textures. Even properly drawn shadows.
	  
	  Notice how the thumb's knuckle bone is shaded lighter because it protrudes outwards.
	  
	  DALL-E is not an illustration tool. It's a 3D rendering engine encoded within a neural net.
