		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/4 "I wonder if you could make a Zettelkasten out of zines." Absolutely. A zine could be used as references or source material for ideas. Or a zine could be repurposed to behave as some form of hybrid commonplace book. Not quite ZK, but in the family. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thehighpony/status/1534233152306266113))
	- 2/4 "I was wondering about discarding the project notes [as Ahrens suggests]. Some of them are valuable as ideas that got booted out of project." By all means, keep what you deem might be useful. Maybe some of what comes up in the proj note will become future zettels. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thehighpony/status/1534233153312890880))
	- 3/4 "Are permanent notes the notes you highlight? Or are they the notes you made about what you highlighted?" The latter: Permanent notes AKA zettels are notes built off of what you highlighted. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thehighpony/status/1534233154311036928))
	- 4/4 "How has yr Zettelkasten made you a better writer?" ZK helps me pull seemingly disparate ideas together & make better sense of the connections. i.e. using economics to explain social media. Punk to explain folk religion. et Brain feels v flexible, "form without form" (B Lee) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thehighpony/status/1534233155280027648))
