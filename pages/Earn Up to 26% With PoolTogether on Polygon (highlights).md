	- PoolTogether is a protocol for no-loss prize games. It enables users to deposit money for a chance to win prizes — and keep all their money even if they don’t win. This is made possible because the pool prizes come from interest accrued on the deposits. The protocol is modeled on a well established concept of “no loss lotteries” and “prize linked savings” which are already popular around the world.
