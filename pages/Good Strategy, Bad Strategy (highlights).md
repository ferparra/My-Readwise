document_note:: Good strategy is a way of focusing effort and resources on critical issues in order to magnify the effectiveness of action. It involves identifying the biggest challenges and creating a coherent approach to overcoming them. It is about creating strength through design, reframing a competitive situation, and creating new patterns of advantage and weakness. It requires leaders who are willing and able to say no to a wide variety of actions and interests, and requires the coordination of policies and actions to create the most powerful results. It is also about making and recording judgments so that progress can be improved.

	- The core of strategy work is always the same: discovering the critical factors in a situation and designing a way of coordinating and focusing actions to deal with those factors. **A leader’s most important responsibility is identifying the biggest challenges to forward progress and devising a coherent approach to overcoming them.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw99pfngb7shw73qpwm7fyf))

	- Strategy is about how an organization will move forward. Doing strategy is figuring out how to advance the organization’s interests. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw99znxv99xyse0gk8nm133))
	- Good strategy is unexpected ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw9a38wkkyxzw7ttr3mr7sm))
	- **Half of what alert participants learn in a strategy exercise is to consider the competition even when no one tells you to do it in advance.** Looking just at the actions of a winning firm, you see only part of the picture. Whenever an organization succeeds greatly, there is also, at the same time, either blocked or failed competition. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw9a78fm23dxdv05rb7ky6s))
		- **Note**: When you are working on a strategy, it is important to think about other organizations and how they might be affected. Even if no one tells you to do this, it is important to think about who else might be impacted. When one organization succeeds, someone else usually fails. It's not enough to just look at the actions of a successful organization - you need to look at the whole picture.
	- Copying elements of its strategy piecemeal, there will be little benefit. A competitor would have to adopt the whole design, not just a part of it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw9afsb16vz4ejbh8xwgjze))
	- Having a true competitive strategy meant engaging in actions that imposed exorbitant costs on the other side ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw9ankjyf76ghw80xek113e))
	- To detect a bad strategy, look for one or more of its four major hallmarks:
	  
	  1.  Fluff.
	  2.  Failure to face the challenge.
	  3.  Mistaking goals for strategy.
	  4.  Bad strategic objectives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw9arvvrc8d62y39shxw4rn))
		- **Note**: Good strategy is characterized by facing the challenge, having clear objectives, and taking the necessary steps to achieve those objectives. Bad strategy can be identified by the presence of fluff, failure to face the challenge, mistaking goals for strategy, or bad strategic objectives.
	- A leader’s most important job is creating and constantly adjusting this strategic bridge between goals and objectives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw9ejargrxy227j5n4y0dsy))
	- The second form of bad strategic objectives is one that is “blue sky.” A good strategy defines a critical challenge. What is more, it builds a bridge between that challenge and action, between desire and immediate objectives that lie within grasp. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw9ef44q96cq6ms1md20adc))
	- Good strategy is coherent action backed up by an argument, an effective mixture of thought and action with a basic underlying structure I call the kernel. The kernel of a strategy contains three elements:
	  
	  1.  **A diagnosis that defines or explains the nature of the challenge.**
	  2.  **A guiding policy for dealing with the challenge.**
	  3.  **A set of coherent actions that are designed to carry out the guiding policy.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw9b59r4tx2f2fqz6bnwfc6))
		- **Note**: The kernel of a good strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis of the challenge, a guiding policy for dealing with it, and a set of coherent actions to implement the policy. These must all be present for a strategy to be successful.
	- The idea that coordination, by itself, can be a source of advantage is a very deep principle. It is often underappreciated because people tend to think of coordination in terms of continuing mutual adjustments among agents. Strategic coordination, or coherence, is not ad hoc mutual adjustment. It is coherence imposed on a system by policy and design. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw9cvjy7kgfza11s7zhb1br))
		- **Note**: Coordinating activities can be very helpful and powerful. It is easy to forget this because most people think of coordination as just working with other people and making small changes. But really, it is about planning something out and sticking to it, so that all of the parts fit together in a way that gives you an advantage.
	- **One of a leader’s most powerful tools is the creation of a good proximate objective—one that is close enough at hand to be feasible.** Proximate objectives not only cascade down hierarchies; they cascade in time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw9btg4y590vgrzwfe6thnx))

		- **Note**: A leader's most important job is to set goals that are close enough to being achievable. These goals spread down from the leader to the people below them, and people work on them over a period of time.
	- Increasing value requires a strategy for progress on at least one of four different fronts: deepening advantages, broadening the extent of advantages, creating higher demand for advantaged products or services, or strengthening the isolating mechanisms that block easy replication and imitation by competitors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw9dhw2gk5avxe204b1v3zv))
	- To guide your own thinking in strategy work, you must cultivate three essential skills or habits.
	  
	  1.  First, you must have a variety of tools for fighting your own myopia and for guiding your own attention.
	  2.  Second, you must develop the ability to question your own judgment. If your reasoning cannot withstand a vigorous attack, your strategy cannot be expected to stand in the face of real competition.
	  3.  Third, you must cultivate the habit of making and recording judgments so that you can improve. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw9ds9v2ty2be8dxpqpnrhe))
		- **Note**: Good strategy requires the cultivation of three skills: the ability to use a variety of tools to fight myopia and guide one's attention; the ability to question one's own judgment and ensure that it can withstand attack; and the habit of making and recording judgments to improve.
