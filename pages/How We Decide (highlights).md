document_note:: This book explores the science of decision making and how to improve it by utilizing both the emotional and rational aspects of the brain. Tom Brady is highlighted as an example of someone who uses his feelings to make decisions and a story is shared of a pilot who also relied on his feelings to navigate an unimaginable situation. The book also discusses avoiding "paralysis by analysis" and trusting one's gut instincts when making big decisions. The point is also made that the emotional brain has been around for much longer than the rational brain and to keep this in mind when making decisions. Overall, readers should be aware of their emotional and rational sides when making decisions, and trust their gut when making big decisions.
