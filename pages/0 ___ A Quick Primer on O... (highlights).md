	  a quick primer on options pricing

	  'stop donating money to big VC and pass the wasabi'

	  you can do it too! (in just 2 simple steps)

	  every financial instrument exists on a complexity spectrum
	  
	  spot < swaps < options
	  
	  are 3 ordered examples
	  
	  understood by
	  
	  most < some < few
	  
	  perhaps, for once, let's attempt to say something real ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mgnr_io/status/1417742384536768512))

	  TLDR
	  
	  if you haven't been a professional options trader for some years, you don't even know what you don't know
	  
	  thusly
	  
	  almost any move you make vs an informed counterparty
	  
	  is probably -EV
	  
	  don't let @tastytrade fool you
	  
	  stay far, far away
	  
	  and farther again

	  anyway
	  
	  as a trader, or operator, it helps to have an instinct that opacity = danger
	  
	  for many exotic products
	  
	  the only reason somebody invented them
	  
	  is so that somebody else will misprice them
	  
	  'sounds like x, but secretly behaves as y'

	  to date, MGNR have intentionally stayed out of the 'treasury management' game
	  
	  partly because it's a labor intensive sales job (womp womp)
	  
	  and partly because it's a used car yard...find uninformed counterparties and lead them down the garden path

	  we've had 3 projects consult with us for help understanding pricing for treasury call options
	  
	  every deal was:
	  
	  * very bad for the treasury (no surprise)
	  
	  * very good for the counterparty (no surprise)
	  
	  * treasury didn't even know how to price what they were giving up ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mgnr_io/status/1417742406938628096))

	  those 'wow we don't even have to give up our token it's just a loan!' deals?
	  
	  because the repayment currency isn't specified
	  
	  it's an embedded option
	  
	  you're getting rinsed

	  now let's learn
	  
	  *an important point*
	  
	  a call option has a value that can easily be expressed in dollars!
	  
	  so if you're say, $SUSHI, and you're comparing selling [discounted spot] vs [a call]
	  
	  the question is simple
	  
	  how much $ value does each choice give away? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mgnr_io/status/1417742416077942784))
	- 8 /
	  
	  here's how
	  
	  1. from @GenesisVol, use 30d realized volatility for a token as a proxy for fair volatility

	- 9 /
	  
	  2. go to https://t.co/PWHbTRF2s1 and plug in the basic parameters (token px, call strike px, duration, volatility)

	  et voila!
	  
	  we have an estimate for $ value of a call option
	  
	  using just 2 free websites

	- 11 /
	  
	  we need to understand
	  
	  1. crypto (specifically alts) are extremely volatile compared to say, US equities, which gives call options IMMENSE value
	  
	  2. longer duration options are worth MORE $, and don't really relate to long term alignment. because, all risk can be hedged ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mgnr_io/status/1417742435849965569))
	- 12 /
	  
	  so now
	  
	  $SUSHI
	  
	  let's test our methods on some of the #phantomtroupe proposals 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6zRenJUcAAKzb8.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mgnr_io/status/1417742443844300800))
	- 13 /
	  
	  here's @SBF_Alameda proposing to EXTEND the duration of the option
	  
	  which gives it MORE value
	  
	  and makes $SUSHI project WORSE off
	  
	  2 yrs, $12 strike: $3.96
	  5 yrs, $12 strike: $5.73
	  
	  btw, notice how awful these deals are for $SUSHI
	  
	  like, *really* *really* deep discounts

	  here's a guy who gets it!
	  
	  we weren't even competing for this deal but at almost 90% discount (a free 5 yr call option) it's impossible to ignore

	  you know who knows how to price options?
	  
	  probably @lightspeedvp 
	  
	  straight from the tech valley x bain playbook
	  
	  deeply discounted nice guys

	  so anyway
	  
	  we have no fish in this tank
	  
	  but can see you're surrounded by sharks
	  
	  and like
	  
	  at least one person
	  
	  in 300 forum posts
	  
	  needs to say
	  
	  'a free 2 year $SUSHI call option @ 2x strike is actually a 59% price discount'
	  
	  worse than the original (rejected) proposal

	  there's a gigantic logic leap that seems to happen with these treasury management deals
	  
	  "
	  oh we can't agree on a price we both understand?
	  
	  then express it to me in a price i definitely don't understand, but you probably do
	  "
	  
	  at least there'll be resolution
