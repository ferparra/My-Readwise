document_note:: In The God Delusion, Richard Dawkins examines the flaws in many religious arguments and the harm religion has caused throughout history. He argues that atheists should be respected for their healthy skepticism and that they can appreciate the world better than most. Dawkins suggests that simpler explanations are preferable to the "God hypothesis", and that children should not be labelled by their parents' religion. He also argues that morality does not originate from the Bible, but instead has a Darwinian explanation, and that religion is a "mis-firing of something useful" and can spread like a "mind virus". Dawkins believes that religion can be harmful, and that its teaching in schools is a form of indoctrination and mental abuse. He concludes that religion may fill a "much needed gap" but that these needs can be better filled by non-religious means such as philosophy and science.

One is that a really smart being designed it all. The other is that something simpler was able to create something so complicated by itself.
