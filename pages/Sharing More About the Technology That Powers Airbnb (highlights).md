	- Our culture centers around a few key tenets – autonomy, data, experimentation and diversity:
	  
	  •   Autonomy: From their first day on the job, engineers have a voice in what teams they join and what projects they work on. Mobility across teams is a part of our culture because we believe that engineers are most productive when they work on problems that challenge and inspire them the most.
	  •   Data: The importance of data as a philosophy was baked into the DNA of Airbnb from the beginning. Our seventh hire was actually a data scientist and we invested in building a modern data architecture and infrastructure early on. We currently have around 100 people in our data scientist organization, with 50-60 software engineers specializing in data. We view our data as the voice of our consumer at scale.
	  •   Experimentation: We rely heavily on experimentation and have a strong “test and learn” culture. In 2017, we ran more than 2,500 A/B tests on our platform alone. Almost every product change we make is based on experiments. We run these tests to ensure we are rolling out features safely and to determine a team’s impact on the entire organization.
	  •   Diversity: We believe that to truly have a platform that is inclusive and free of biases, that we have to build our teams in the same way. Throughout the engineering organization – and company – we rely on mission-driven teams that bring together a diversity of skills, disciples and experiences, and proactively work to elevate new voices and ideas.
