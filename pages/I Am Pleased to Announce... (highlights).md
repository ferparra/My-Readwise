	- I am pleased to announce some significant improvements to the code
	  that accompanies my book, "Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction".

	- There is now one colab per figure, instead of per chapter. This more modular approach makes it easier to incrementally improve the figures. For example, some of them are now interactive, using colab widgets. And figure quality (e.g., fonts, legends) is being slowly improved.

	- Shared code is factored out into a new pip installable repo called probml-utils. We now use continuous integration in the github backend to test all the code.
	  The old chapter notebooks and scripts are deprecated.
	  All pytorch code has now been translated to JAX. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sirbayes/status/1522450757601046528))
	- As a reader of the online version of the book,
	  the  only visible change (apart from fixing a few typos in the text) is that figure URLs now have the form https://t.co/4vi75wsCsg. Legacy URLs of the form
	  https://t.co/AYdVVPQ3yM now redirect to the new notebooks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sirbayes/status/1522450758754471936))
	- Thanks to @patel_zeel_, @KarmPatel216,  and @nipun_batra for all their work on this.
	  Stay tuned for more improvements once #GSOC kicks off. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sirbayes/status/1522450760029511683))
