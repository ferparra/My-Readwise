- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- Most of resting metabolic needs are for the brain – 75% of metabolic needs come from the brain
	- Growth hormones come from the brain and are released to the pituitary which stimulates bone, muscle, fat to increase metabolism
	- Profile of growth hormone changes over time: between the 30s-40s, growth hormone decreases two to three-fold
	- Meditation can increase growth hormone release: 20 minutes of mediation per day can stimulate delta wave activity
	- Specifics of exercise to increase growth hormone release: weight lifting or endurance activity but must be limited to 60-75 minutes – (1) proper warm-up (literally warming body temperature) of about 10 minutes accelerates growth hormone release; (2) exercise hard but not to failure; (3) moderate blood glucose before and after exercise (no sugary energy drinks); (3) bring body temperature back down quickly
	- Exercise triggers the release of growth hormone and IGF-1 which positively impacts memory and cognition
	- Sauna has a profound effect on decreasing cortisol and releasing growth hormone, increasing 16-fold (that’s 1,600%): (1) sauna between 176F-210F; (2) 20-30 minutes in duration then rapid cooling, repeat
