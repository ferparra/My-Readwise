	- The system is not bad, it's average.
	  
	  Teachers face the impossible task of meeting all students where they are: 
	  
	  The math whiz.
	  The introvert.
	  The child with an IEP.
	  The front-row hand-raiser.
	  
	  The result?
	  
	  Despite tremendous effort, each child is underserved in some way. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1442484867141414914))
	- Just read these quotes. 
	  
	  Sharp insights that all point to the same problem:
	  
	  The one-size-fits-all system doesn’t fit my one-in-a-million child.

	- Let me say this again: 
	  
	  The system will not fully serve your child. 
	  
	  Nor should you expect it to.
	  
	  Which leaves you with a choice:
	  
	  Accept the system or build your own around it? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1442484871184662528))
	- Excuse 1: There's no time
	  
	  Check your kid’s screen time and compare the time they spent creating vs time spent consuming.
	  
	  Is that the right mix? 
	  
	  Now check yours: 
	  
	  What are you role-modeling?

	- Excuse 2: Education is too expensive
	  
	  Khan Academy: Free
	  Coursera: Free
	  YouTube: Free
	  Twitter: Free ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1442484874871558144))
	- Excuse 3: Our schedule is packed
	  
	  Night School has become Right Now School. 
	  
	  3.5 billion global smartphones = learn wherever
	  
	  Course recordings = learn whenever
	  
	  WhatsApp groups & Slack channels = classmates on demand ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1442484876150722562))
	- Excuse 4: We got the "bad" teacher
	  
	  Everytown, USA: 2 legendary teachers, a solid band of stalwarts, a couple riding out their tenure, and one that’s reportedly pure evil.
	  
	  @yu_angela has taught coding to almost 1M students and gets an average grade of 4.7/5 from 350K of them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1442484877698367499))
	- Excuse 5: We can't get into the good school
	  
	  Despite getting into NYU Stern, I got shut out of  @profgalloway popular brand class 3 times. 
	  
	  Today @section_four 
	  
	  Same content.
	  Same instructor.
	  No GMAT.
	  No NYC rent.
	  And you pay 90% less. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1442484879330009090))
	- Excuse 6: There's no community
	  
	  College: 18-22 year-olds who learn "just-in-case" topics & compete for grades on the school's schedule
	  
	  Online cohorts: a global community of 12-92 year-olds who opt into an "on-demand" topic with I-win-you-win incentives

	- In summary
	  
	  You child needs a learning system that supplements the existing education system
	  
	  Content: abundant, current & free
	  Teachers: measured & available
	  Distribution: in your pocket & on-demand
	  Community: global, diverse, & connected 
	  
	  Easy? No
	  
	  Absolutely critical? Yes ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1442484882211487745))
