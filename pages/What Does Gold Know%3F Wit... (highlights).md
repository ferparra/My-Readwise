	- What does gold know? With real rates rising as quickly as they are, the tried-and-true TIPS model suggests that gold should have fallen to 1600 or so. Instead, it is holding in like a champ at around $1950. Why? üßµ

	- Perhaps gold ‚Äúknows‚Äù that if bond yields keep rising to the point of undermining growth, the Fed will be forced to dust off the 1940‚Äôs playbook by continuing/resuming its asset purchases indefinitely, much like the BoJ has been doing for years, and the ECB is hinting at now. /2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TimmerFidelity/status/1515040659861913604))
	- We are used to talking about a Fed put in the stock market, but what if in the future the put will apply to the bond market instead? If inflation becomes structural while the Fed financially represses bond yields, real rates could remain negative for a long time. /3 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TimmerFidelity/status/1515040661598347271))
	- If investors worry that real rates will remain structurally negative, it could make sense to seek shelter in gold and also equities (and maybe Bitcoin). In that case, it‚Äôs the orange line above that could become the model to follow for gold. /4 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TimmerFidelity/status/1515040663204728833))
	- The TIPS real rate model, which has explained gold‚Äôs price action so well in recent years, assumes that gold only goes up when real rates fall (i.e., turn less positive or more negative). But I wonder if this will still be the case. /5 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TimmerFidelity/status/1515040664769159170))
	- Investors might only need to be convinced that real rates will be negative for a long time, and that alone could lead to more investor demand and therefore higher prices. /6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TimmerFidelity/status/1515040666295934986))
	- With gold having turned into a forgotten relic in the wake of Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise, I wonder if the widespread institutional adoption that the Bitcoiners talk about will hit the gold market first? It‚Äôs just a thought. /7 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TimmerFidelity/status/1515040668023934981))
	- If we ponder viable investment choices through the lens of structurally negative real rates, maybe it‚Äôs not so strange that equities are so well bid. Maybe the search for real returns in an inflationary world will drive the final chapter of the secular bull market. /END
