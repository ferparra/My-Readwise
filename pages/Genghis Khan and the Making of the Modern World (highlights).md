document_note:: Genghis Khan was a Mongol ruler who led the Mongol army to establish one of the largest empires in history. Despite their traditionally brutal conquests, Genghis Khan abolished torture and allowed universal religious freedom, which helped to shape the modern world. Through his rule, Genghis Khan made advances in astronomy, spread the use of the compass and gunpowder, invented the violin, and pioneered democracy and government. He also created the largest trade route of his time, promoted universal literacy, and established an international postal system, paper money, and the belief in diplomatic immunity. His influence and legacy is still felt today, with a large portion of Asia's population tracing their genetics back to him.
