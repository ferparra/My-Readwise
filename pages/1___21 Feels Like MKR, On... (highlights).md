	- 1/21
	  
	  Feels like MKR, once a defi darling, has kind of had its days behind it.
	  
	  We're seeing a pretty big shift that I think highlights really interesting lessons for defi projects. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619892940283906))

	  $DAI won out by being novel, innovative and most importantly defining for the ecosystem. The $MKR team created the foundation tooling and standards for many of the practices we have in defi today. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619894496227329))

	  But, as they've grown and further decentralized they've built great procedures for managing the existing DAO operations within a framework, but not for fostering innovation.
	  
	  Which is a classic startup problem only amplified by unstructured systems. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619896257990656))
	- 4/21
	  
	  They shifted from SAI to DAI adding multiple assets and trying to correct the peg problems by simply stacking on USDC and then just continuing their same executional path. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619897767890944))
	- 5/21
	  
	  MakerDAO enjoyed the benefit of adoption through being the only decentralized stablecoin early on and that really let them flourish, but that's not a novelty they enjoy anymore.
	  
	  For products this is what we call the 'blue ocean vs red ocean' problem. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619899172937728))
	- 6/21
	  
	  It's why many startups can move in an agile way and displace industry titans, and in stablecoins we're seeing just that. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619900636676097))
	- 7/21
	  
	  Want fiat reliability? Use $USDC.
	  
	  Need something entirely defi native, with no fiat and low volatility? Use $RAI
	  
	  Want ETH only collateral again? $LQTY
	  
	  Diverse algorithm? $FRAX
	  
	  Use diverse collateral? $USDP
	  
	  Backed but not stable? $OHM ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619902117425152))
	- 8/21
	  
	  Degen yield styled DAI? $MIM
	  
	  Self-repaying position? $alUSD
	  
	  Not to mention dozens of other USD and non-USD stables.
	  
	  There has never been a more competitive and innovative time in stablecoins. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619903467905027))
	- 9/21
	  
	  While being hammered from all sides, we also know regulation is breathing down the neck of the industry, and as one of the first early defi projects, and the largest defi stablecoin, there is no doubt that MakerDAO would be in the sights of regulators. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619905112125440))
	- 10/21
	  
	  Now that doesn't mean anything will happen, or that if it does that it will be bad. It simply means that there is a higher amount of risk there. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619906609491968))
	- 11/21
	  
	  The only thing $DAI has offered over the past year, is its demand in protocols.
	  
	  Because of its long history its one of the most common assets to see in yield farming pools and a quick look at the top holders list shows most of its demand is contract/farming driven

	- 12/21
	  
	  But, $DAI sits at only 398,000 holders an increase of 0.010% this past month.
	  
	  Compared to USDC at 1.4M or USDT at 3.6M.
	  
	  PAX which secures less than $1B to DAI's $6B even has 109,000 holders. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619913307828225))
	- 13/21
	  
	  And with the current rate of burn, MKR's annual protocol revenue is only $32M or 1.54% of its market cap, giving it a fairly staggering price to earnings ratio of 64x and that is after the large price drop that its felt in recent days.

	- 14/21
	  
	  This doesn't mean DAI as a token goes away, I think it will likely always exist in our ecosystem, but I do think we've crossed a tipping point where $DAI is not only no longer the only defi stablecoin, but it no longer has a narrative of being the defi native stablecoin. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619919196540928))
	- 15/21
	  
	  Suddenly, that once held title seems entirely up for grabs and there are some pretty clear front runners. While I think one will take that branding lead, I think we'll also see leading stablecoins across multiple niches. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619920521998341))
	- 16/21
	  
	  As we've seen in the list earlier in this thread, there seems to be a stablecoin for every purpose, and I think that's actually a good thing as it decentralizes dependency risk.
	  
	  It's also huge for stableswap projects. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619921964834822))
	- 17/21
	  
	  Honestly 6 months ago I thought the saving grace for MakerDao would have been instant exits from L2s or sidechains, but they seem to be late out the gate on that and strong bridges like $SYN (synapse), Hop Protocol, and Anyswap (among others) are eating their lunch there. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619923533451264))
	- 18/21
	  
	  With how good these bridges have become and the liquidity they've had, and in many cases the large amount of incentives these new projects can throw at generating liquidity, I think they'll be hard to displace. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619925034962953))
	- 19/21
	  
	  I think the next few months is all about bridges, novel stable assets, and regulation.
	  
	  Even regulation aside, I think Maker is batting 0/2 here. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619926716928002))
	- 20/21
	  
	  Don't get me wrong, I hope they turn it around, as I think that ecosystem is capable of so much when they are at their best, and pushed to their best.
	  
	  I just don't feel they've delivered that recently. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619928130408449))
	- 21/21
	  
	  One thing is clear there has never been a time where it has been more competitive, or potentially more rewarding for an ecosystem to be building a defi native stablecoin.
	  
	  I'll be watching this sector super closely. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1441619929652871171))
