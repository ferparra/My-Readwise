- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 18th, 2022]]
	- Is there any relationship between the [[Ubermensch]] and the Night of Faith?
	- how do we deal with despair and meaning?
	- the reason why he chooses the child is because the child is the near perfect analogy of how the [[Ubermensch]] or overman lives
	- [[Kierkegaard]] uses ballet as an example of the knight of faith, leaping into the infinite and coming back to finitude, thus, creation and innocence, whereby a snapshot of a leap is a demonstration of their own world of play, innocence and creation
	- the knight of faith is beyond and past the aesthetic and ethical stages of life, society screams “thou shalt” but both shalt not
	- the only way to be a self is to consciously synthesis the self within finitude and infinitude
	- the Knight of Faith is the finality of a realisation and the Ubermensch is the process and action with which you carry yourself.
