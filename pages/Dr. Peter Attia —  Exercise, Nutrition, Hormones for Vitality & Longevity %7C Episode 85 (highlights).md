	- The Best Way to Enhance the Size of Neurons
	  
	  Summary:
	  It's basically grip strength, its mobility. For women, i think we're doing 75 % a body weight, or something like that. We use diferent things like vertical jump, ground contact time for jumping off a box. So it's really trying to capture, and it's an evolution, right? Like i think the test is going to get only more and more involved as we, as weep, as we get envolved.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 3
	  I think we're doing 75% of body weight or something like that. Yeah. Great. I love it as indirect measures of how healthy and how long we're going to live.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  It's basically grip strength. It's mobility. I mean, again, walking with that much weight for some people initially is really hard. You know, we use different things like vertical jump, ground contact time. If you're jumping off a box, things like that. So it's really trying to capture and it's an evolution, right? Like I think the test is going to get only more and more involved as we as we as we get involved because it took us about a year. Beth Lewis did the majority of the work to develop this. Beth runs our strength and stability program in the practice. And basically I just asked her with like, hey, go out to the literature and come up with all of the best movements that we think are proxies for what you need to be like the most kickass, you know, what we call centenarian to Catholic, which is the person living in their marginal decade at the best.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Well, what I'm about to say is certainly a mechanistic leap. But if you look at the literature on exercise related neurogenesis in mice or brain atrophy or brain hypertrophy, et cetera, in animal models, it's very clear that the best way to get a nervous system to atrophy, to lose neurons, shrink neurons and or lose connections between neurons is to stop that animal from moving or to de enrich its environment, to private of some sensory input or multiple sensory inputs.

	- Don't Smoke Nicotine
	  
	  Summary:
	  All three of them either swim, jog or play tenn or racket ball multiple times per week. They're all cognitively still extremely sharp. But i was kind of surprised to learn that lagues that were so intellectually strong were also so obsessed with exercise. And early on linked that to theyr a some of their intellectual vigor over time. What are your thoughts about not smoking? Let's decide t be really cleared, people, don't smoke nicotine. Vape nicotine. It's gon shorten your life.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  All three of them either swim, jog or play tennis or racquetball, I think is Richard's thing multiple times per week. Eric, they're all cognitively still extremely sharp, still interested in the arts, doing science, curious about science, running laboratories, writing books, going on podcasts. I mean, it's incredible. Again, that's ANIC data. But I was kind of surprised to learn that colleagues that were so intellectually strong, were also so obsessed with exercise. I mean, they really are obsessed with their exercise routine. And early on linked that to their some of their intellectual vigor over time. I want to just also use as a jumping off point to ask about one kind of niche thing, but it comes up. I don't think I'm going to out which one of those told me this, but one of those three individuals choose an excessive amount of nicker at. Used to be a smoker and I asked him why and he said because in his estimation, it's protective against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's or at least the nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation of nicotine because nicotine is a acetylcholine receptor, obviously is known to create a state of focus and neural enhancement. What are your thoughts about not smoking? Let's just I want to be really clear. People don't smoke nicotine vape nicotine. It's going to shorten your life. Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, in my opinion. ([Time 0:54:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/12d136f1-050b-4c8d-b453-e2cd9235c614))
	- I've Never Been a Woman Getting My Hormone Profile
	  
	  Summary:
	  A woman has much more test astrone in her body than astrogen. In absolute amounts, she has more test ostrome than estrogen. So even though a woman's test osteron much less than a men, than a man's level a, it's still more than she has estrogen in her body.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  We've done episodes on estrogen testosterone, but frankly, as I think back to those, we didn't really go into the biology of estrogen testosterone. No.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah. So I mean, actually an interesting aside that I always tell my female patients who get a kick out of this. When you look at a woman's labs, you'll see her estrogen, her progesterone, her FSH, her LH, her testosterone, her sex hormone binding globulin, all these things. But based on the units they're reported in, it's a very distorting picture of what the most common androgen is in her body. If you actually convert them to the same units, she has much more testosterone in her body than estrogen.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Interesting. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  I did not know that. Then again, I've never been a woman getting my hormone profile. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So even though a woman's testosterone is much less than a man than a man's level, it's still more than she has estrogen in her body. So phenotypically, estrogen is the hormone that's dominating. And so it's that she has much higher estrogen than a man and much lower testosterone than a man, but in absolute amounts, she has more testosterone than estrogen, just worth pointing that out. Incredible. ([Time 1:05:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5d712ff1-cd71-4169-ac3a-c1580b1d00fa))
	- Anavar and Testosterone
	  
	  Summary:
	  Ten milligrams subling two to three times a week. Anavar basically being d h t x o oga, hels yoot. A micro dose of this has to be small enough that it doesn't impair your body's ability to make testasteron.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 3
	  Was a low dose of anavar in that context? Ten milligrams, subling, two to three times a week.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Anavar basically being DHT. It oxandralone. Exactly. And again, we're not recommending this. This is actually if you're playing a competitive sport can get you banned from that sport.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  You can also get you banned from having children if you do it incorrectly.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah. So a micro dose of this has to be small enough that it doesn't impair your body's ability to make testosterone, but anavar has such a high affinity for SHBG that it basically distracts your SHBG from binding your testosterone. Freeing up testosterone. That's exactly right. So the goal was how do I just give you more free testosterone? So if a patient shows up and they've got a total testosterone of 900 nanograms per deciliter, which would place them at, you know, depending on the scale you look at the scale we look at, that would place you at about the 70th percentile. But your free testosterone is, you know, eight nanograms per deciliter. So that's pretty bad. That means you're less than one percent free. A guy should be about two percent free tea. So that dude should be closer to 16 to 18 nanograms per deciliter. So in that situation that I just gave you, his SHBG is really high. His SHBG is probably in the 80 to 90 range.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  That's very high because I think the upper range is somewhere around 55, 56. Exactly. ([Time 1:28:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2fdbf91b-82f4-4230-992b-13fd554e77e7))
	- Do You Think Normalizing Test Ostrone Improves Insulin Resistance?
	  
	  Summary:
	  Tistostrone is a drug that can't be taken orally, so you have to take it under the tongue. A test astro improves glacimic control, tist ostrone improves insolent signalling. The role musceles play as a glucose reservoir, n aglucose sink.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  It's too complicated for patients.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  You know, it's a drug that can't be taken orally. So you have to take it under the tongue. Like a troche or something. Right. But then you know, I had one patient, once who even though we told him about 87 times that he was like swallowing the anibars and his liver function and he was talking 10 milligrams three times a week as a high any dose and three months of him or whatever, two months of him swallowing that every time tripled his liver function test. So it's like it's just I was like, you know, it's just not worth the hassle of doing this for, you know, perfection in reality. We can fix this another way. So the first order question is, do we believe clinically you will benefit from normalizing your free testosterone or taking it to a level that's called 80th to 90th percentile, so upper normal limit of physiologic ranges? That's the first order question. And that's going to come down to symptoms and that's going to come down to some biomarkers. I think there's two years ago, was it two years ago or maybe a year ago? Very good study came out that looked at pre diabetic men. You've probably talked about this study and looking at insulin resistance and glucose disposal within without testosterone and the evidence was overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. This shouldn't be surprising, by the way, given the role muscles play as a glucose reservoir and a glucose sink. So now I include that as one of the things that we will consider as a factor for using testosterone. Now, again, it's not the only one.

	- Dosing For Aromatis Inhibitors
	  
	  Summary:
	  Most of our patients do not take aromatis inhibitors. It's really only the high aromatizes that need it. The half life of the drug is i think its about three and a half days, is the plasma half life,. I could be off a little bit, but, but twice week dosing is is really nice.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  Actually think it's worse than that. I think that they simply don't understand and don't care because it's a pill mill and it's a money mill. I think that nowadays it seems almost everybody who's doing TRT is taking lower doses more frequently every other day or twice a week dividing the dose and being very, very careful with these estrogen or aromatase blockers.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  We most of our patients do not take aromatase inhibitors. It's not needed. It's really only the high aromatizers that need it. And so, yeah, when we'll talk about testosterone, we'll talk about dosing there because I agree that more frequently you can take it the better and frankly, you don't need to go more frequently than twice a week because it's so slow. Half life of the drug is I think it's about three and a half days is the plasma half life or something like that. It could be off a little bit, but twice week dosing is really nice. So if you're if you go to like a testosterone clinic that's giving you 200 every two weeks, 50 twice a week is the same total dose, which by the way, is a physiologic dose that's not going to give somebody any of the side effects you would see. You're not going to get acne with that. You're not going to get gynecomastia. You're not going to get anything. The only real side effect you get from that is you will get to stickular atrophy.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  That is enough to suppress. Yeah, to maintain fertility.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  What do you typically do for?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, so this is where so I'll finish the story on clomid because we currently do not use clomid and that's that's due to a really interesting observation ([Time 1:41:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c73be158-a3c3-4941-89bc-c1b83d2257ad))
	- Is Clomed a Good Thing?
	  
	  Summary:
	  Desmostral, which is still a steral, was potentially more damaging and created more oxidative stress in the andithelium. We then switched to h c g, which we used to use sometimes instead of clomed but it's more cumbersome to work with. Body builders will often use this in their po cyco therapy as the way to kind of recover fun. And we would just use it now as ongoing therapy for someone who still has testicular reserve.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  We are suspecting is that desmasterol, which is still a sterile, was potentially more damaging and created more oxidative stress in the end of the endothelium in the sub endothelial space than cholesterol, which would at least suggest to us, and again, we're taking a lot of leaps here that maybe having high desmasterol, very high desmasterol, is not a good thing. And so once we kind of pieced all that together a few years ago, we were like, yeah, we're just not going to prescribe clomid anymore. And we then switched to HCG, which we used to use sometimes instead of clomid, but it's more cumbersome to work with.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  It needs to be refrigerated. It's a much more fragile molecule. Yeah, I think we talked about this once.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  It's almost like if you if you accidentally knock over the little bottle, it's basically gone bad. Travel with it is very challenging. Travel with it.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  It's a needle. It's an injection sub-Q. So easy to administer. It's not I am or anything like that, but it's just more of a hassle factor. But that said, it has the benefit that clomid does, which is it preserves the testicular function, it preserves the testicular volume. So bodybuilders will often use this in their post-cycle therapy as a way to kind of recover function. And we would just use it now as ongoing therapy for a guy who still has testicular reserve.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So ([Time 1:45:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f03d3526-e52b-447c-80cb-b6d516b4eb43))
	- The Importance of Fixing Test Astron
	  
	  Summary:
	  I'm really glad that you brought up this issue of total testast s free tea. There is very little correlation between someone's absolute test astrone and how they here. The only purpose, in my mind, of fixing test ostrone is to give you the capacity to work harder. This should just give you a greater ability to experience muscle protein synthesis.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  I'm really glad that you brought up this issue of total testosterone versus free tea. And the reason is ever since going on podcast and talking about this stuff and talking about on this podcast, people will send me their numbers. They'll send me their charts and then they'll send photos of themselves. And I can tell you, while I'm not a clinician and I haven't done fancy statistics on it, there is very little correlation between someone's absolute testosterone and how they appear. I mean, some of these guys look really lean, really strong and they'll say, Oh, total testosterone is five fifty, four eighty, right? And then other people, you know, testosterone is eight sixty, but they look at them and you think, oh, they kind of got what kind of a doughy look to them. And so it's got to be this free testosterone. Plus estrogen, et cetera training and nutrition.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Right. I mean, I just think I think for all this talk about testosterone, which I enjoy talking about and I enjoy talking about the data on long-term health consequences of testosterone, because there's another controversial topic. I also think people kind of overstate its importance. I agree. And I think there's a there's a there's a group of people who think if I could just fix my testosterone, everything will be better. And it's sort of like, no, actually, that's not true at all. Really, the only purpose in my mind of fixing testosterone is to give you the capacity to work harder. It's really going to help you recover more from your workouts. This should just give you a greater ability to experience muscle protein synthesis.

	- Collustral is a Hydrophobic Mole
	  
	  Summary:
	  Cluster all is a hydrophobic molecule that is synthesized by every cell in the human. Conditions that impair clestral synthesis, depending on their severity, can be fatal in utero. Anything that really interferes with our ability to produce cla all will is a threat to us as a species.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  So first, let's differentiate between cholesterol and fat just for the listener because we use them. You know, I don't want to make sure people understand. So cholesterol is a really complicated molecule. So it's a ringed molecule. Got I used to know exactly what its structure was, but like it could have 36 carbons for all I remember. It is a lipid. So it is a hydrophobic molecule that is synthesized by every cell in the human body. It is so important that without it, if you look at sort of genetic conditions that impair cholesterol synthesis, depending on their severity, they can be fatal in utero. So in other words, anything that really interferes with our ability to produce cholesterol will is a threat to us as a species. And the reason for that is cholesterol makes up the cell membrane of every cell in our body. ([Time 2:04:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1f07b6d1-24da-49ea-8b44-4738573dd71c))
	- What Is Saturated Fat?
	  
	  Summary:
	  Saturated fat is a long chain fatty acid that is fully saturated, meaning at has no double bonds. The observation that eating saturated fat raises clustral is generally correct. So it's important to differentiate between the what is saturated fat?
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  So why is it that it's pretty easy to find studies or at least people with who are highly credentialed from good institutions claiming that eating saturated fat is different. Saturated fat, red meat, things that are rich in cholesterol. To be more specific is bad for us in terms of our eventual LDL.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So this is two different things. So saturated fat consumption in many people will raise LDL cholesterol. So it's important to differentiate between the what is saturated fat. So saturated fat, of course, is a fatty acid, just so people understand how totally different molecule from cholesterol. Cholesterol is a very complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, is just a long chain fatty acid that is fully saturated, meaning it has no double bonds and it can exist in isolation. It can exist in a triglyceride, triacylglyceride or a phospholipid or all sorts of things like that. So when we eat foods that contain fat, basically there are three distinctions for that fat. Is it saturated? Is it mono unsaturated, one double bond? Or is it polyunsaturated, two or more double bonds? The observation that eating saturated fat raises cholesterol is generally correct. ([Time 2:09:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4ebb12ca-b33f-425b-a594-0dfb17cf94bd))
	- I Want to Live to a Hundred?
	  
	  Summary:
	  A o b is the thing that drives atheris cerosis. What levels are attractive or repulsive for you? When you see a levels of ob that are blank, you get really concerned. So again, we take a very different view. We have vitality now live, and i want to live to be a hundred? Yes, you soming some taper.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 3
	  Care about the causative agent of atherosclerosis. APOB is the thing that drives atherosclerosis. What levels are attractive or repulsive for you when you see levels of APOB that are blank, you get really concerned.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  It depends on the person's objectives. So again, we take a very different view.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I mean, we have vitality now and I want to live to be 100. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  So if you're assuming some taper. If you tell me you want to live to be 100, you're going to need to keep your APOB below 30 milligrams per deciliter.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Let's say I want to live to be 100, but I also, well, how about I don't care how long I live, but I want to feel great while I live.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Again, it depends, right? Like anybody who's had a heart attack is going to be compromised in their ability to feel well after. Right.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So I guess I point I make say it that way because if you're going to tell me that I'm in order to achieve that live to 100 level, I'm going to have to give up my personal life and my brain functioning.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  Then I'm not really interested in it. Sure. But to get LDL levels and really, again, people think of it as LDL.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  It's really APOB, right? APOB is this total concentration of LDL and VLDL. And that's what matters. Those are the big, the atherogenic particles, LDL also includes the LP little A, although ([Time 2:14:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2cf73809-7e74-43fc-a50a-6790cc08203e))
