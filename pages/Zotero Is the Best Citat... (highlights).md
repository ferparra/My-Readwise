	- Zotero is the best citation management software â€” it's free and does not monetize your data
	  
	  But many folks have a hard time starting out on it.
	  
	  Here's how you can get started on Zotero in 15min:

	- You'll need to install two things:
	  
	  1. Zotero desktop app
	  2. Zotero Connector to connect your app to your web browser
	  
	  Download and install the desktop app first.
	  
	  [For this tutorial, I'm using a Windows PC, and Google Chrome.]

	  Click on "Install Chrome Connector."
	  
	  [Zotero Connectors are also available for Microsoft Edge and Firefox. The Connector for Safari is bundled with Zotero. You can enable it form the Extension pane of the Safari preferences.]

	- After adding the Zotero Connector, click on the puzzle-like sign in the top right corner of Chrome.
	  
	  It will open your Chrome Extensions.
	  
	  Go to Zotero and pin it to your Chrome.

	- Now go to the Zotero desktop app and click on "File" and then "New Collections."
	  
	  [Zotero's collections are *like* folders but they aren't exactly folders. Tell us if you know what the difference is.] 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FiY65kiWQAEaO9L.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1596047503484674049))
	- Think of a project you've worked on in the past and use its title to name the collection: [Project Name]-Mock.
	  
	  Avoid doing it with a work-in-progress when starting out.
	  
	  [For illustrative purposes, I'm naming the collection "Pakistani Anglophone Literature - Mock."] 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FiY7pIxXkAEb3f3.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1596047513554821121))
	- Go to Google Scholar and look up keywords related to your project.
	  
	  [I'm looking up "Pakistani Anglophone Literature."]
	  
	  Then click on the Zotero Connector in the top right corner.
	  
	  [You can also do this with your university's library or a search engine like PubMed.]

	- This will open a "Zotero Item Selector" box with all the search results on the page.
	  
	  Select the items relevant to your project.

	- Zotero will show that it's saving the items in your library.
	  
	  Since I named the collection "Pakistani Anglophone Literature" and looked up the same words, Zotero automatically knows where to save these items. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FiY-4TbXoAMfbxF.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1596047555447627777))
	- Go to the Zotero desktop app and you will see all the selected items in the relevant collection.
	  
	  But that's not it.
	  
	  Zotero will also look for un-paywalled PDFs of these items from around the web and add them to your collection.

	- You can also add items using DOIs, PMIDs, and ISBNs.
	  
	  To do so, click on the "Add Item(s) by Identifier" button and paste the relevant identifier.
	  
	  Here I'm adding an item using its DOI.
	  
	  [Quiz: the first person to tell me the title of this item will get a free Zotero workshop.]

	- Once you've added the items, you can open them up by double clicking on them.
	  
	  You can annotate a PDF (left pane) and take notes (right pane) *in* Zotero.
