	- If you though reskinning 2D videos was fun, how about reskinning 3D captures of the world?
	  
	  That's exactly what you get when you combine NeRFs with InstructPix2Pix in this new paper by @ayaanzhaque et al.

	- InstructPix2Pix is applied to the input 2D views used for training to NeRF in an iterative fashion. 
	  
	  Notice below that the edits are gradually becoming more consistent over time.
	  
	  I'm impressed with how well it works! https://t.co/R262Pdn3tG ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bilawalsidhu/status/1638919453797695488))
