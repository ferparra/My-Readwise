	- ðŸ¤” Struggling to get @NotionHQ adoption at work?
	  
	  Notion's learning curve and infinite possibilities make it difficult to adopt at scale.
	  
	  Often a single team member is tasked with "figuring out" Notion and given the burden of introducing it to the rest of the team. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/typeoneerror/status/1540080524554735616))

	- The result of siloing Notion knowledge is that team members and departments end up with vastly different levels of knowledge, especially if theyâ€™re adopting Notion via templates. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/typeoneerror/status/1540080526379212800))
	- An internal Notion "Champion" might lead your architectural build, or maybe you hire a Notion Certified Consultant to build your workspace. But what happens when the Champion leaves or the Consultant moves on?
	  
	  Organizational knowledge shouldn't be locked in one Champion's brain. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/typeoneerror/status/1540080528010792960))
	- While not everyone on the team needs to be a Notion expert, all team members need to have the ability to work efficiently with Notion and surface key insights from workspaces.
	  
	  Recognizing this challenge, today we're launching/announcing a suite of team trainings for Notion. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/typeoneerror/status/1540080529579462656))
	- We're calling it Notion at Workâ€”live-training to get your entire team up to speed with Notion. We think itâ€™s one of the first of its kind.
	  
	  We've delivered this beta training to a few organizations and it's lead to better collaboration and deeper understanding of the tool. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/typeoneerror/status/1540080531353653248))
	- You can learn more about these new beta trainings on our site.
	  
	  Weâ€™re currently offering a foundational training level and a more advanced level training that gets into the complexities of dashboard building.
