	- Is Your Product Getting Better The More You Use It?
	  
	  Summary:
	  In any consumer product, think about what asset the user is building or creating. How do you optimize s o that that asset of theirs is growing, is compounding? I'm on the board of a company called reckie, and it's a london base company. They're helping restaurants by recasting their cost structures in some way to help them find suppliers for their goods that are better for them.

	  I still think the notion of building into your product something that makes it harder and harder to leave, because you're building up an asset, basically in any consumer product. Think about what asset the user is building or creating. That's the concept i get from your writing. How do you optimize s o that that asset of theirs is growing, is compounding.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Does that seem like a good rule of tom the two tests that i always suggest is, will your users say that the product gets better the more they use it? And will they say that the mor they use the product, the more they have to lose by leaving the product? And if you pass those two tests, then you're going to create a really sticky product for those users. I'll contrast that with an example of companies that haven't been able to do that as anonymous companies. Think about secret or whisper or yikak. And there're a lot of reasons why those companies haven't succeeded, but part of it is that you had no accruing benefits or mounting loss because of anonymity. There's no identity. There's no followers that i accrue. There's nothing that's persistent. And so you could delit. I remember having secret when i was at pintres, and i would delude it, and someone would say, there's some gossip on it. You open it up, and it's exactly the same experience. And so that makes it really hard to have sticky users.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I'd love to explore, we can release this such that it's no longer a stealth company. But you mention by emal that there's a new company that you're an investor in. I'd love to hear the story there, what they're doing and what got you interested.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I'm on the board of a company called reckie, and it's a london base company. It's actually a wonderful story where the founder, his name is ronan given, was maybe masicistic enough to run a hummas chain in london with a couple of assivlings for eight or ten years. And the guy was actually a computer science undergrad, and was always these restaurants are really, really tough businesses, and was always trying to figure out ways to improve the profitability of their restaurant. And because he was a computer engineer by trade, like untraining, he built all these systems to automate as much of their variable cost as possible, the ordering. Whatever they could automate, they built it themselves. They didn't use third parties. But it was still really, really hard to generate consistent profitability. And finally they realized that it was actually their supply chane that was the big reason why they weren't able to be profitable. And if they were, and there were these little tricks that they figured out, where if you order six lemons instead of five lemons, that actually ends ut being cheaper, because you get a crate of lemons instead of buying them individually. Working with different suppliers to figure out the best pricing, there were all these tricks, and once they started to work on that, they were able to build real profitable margins in their business. And an deciding that that was a core insigt, you know, it's one of those earned secrets that people talk about, which is, how do we help restaurants by recasting their cost structures in some way and help them find suppliers for their goods that are better for them? And this is one of those incredibly opaque markets. Rich barden from zolo, who was a venture partner with us at benchmark, talks about how there's some gene in of market places that they're not necessarily transactional, though i believe recky will be, but they're actually what they do as they set information free that was once opaque. Powr of the people, howr o the people. Amen. And so that's what the opportunity that recki is going after, which is that they start its classic solving the chicken or the egg. Started with a tool for the restaurant, the chef in the restaurant. Idont of you familiar with this, but really, what happens right now when a restaurant owner needs to replenish their supplies is that, for the most part, they're calling up a supplier eleven thirty p m, after the kitchens clean, and they've taken stock of all the things that they need, and they're leaving a voice mail on a supplier's voice message machine, so that in the morning, someone at the supplier will listen to all the voice mals, transcribe the order into their po system and then their inventory system and do the order. And that, you might imagine, not the best way to do things. There's a lot of friction with that process. And so they are by going after the buyers, which is the restaurants. And they start to use recky to place their orders for their products. And at let's recky then actually crowd source the catalogues of all these suppliers. And they're now a double diget percentage market share in london, and growing quickly in other cities and other countries. And it's just been superinteresting to see, because it's one of these places where there have been a lot of companies that've gone after this opportunity, but they've all started with plier side instead of the byer side. And so it just shows you that there's, there's still such greenfield opportunity out there. Just because other companies have failed, doesn't mean that there isn't an opportunity, just about figuring out the right angle of attack.
