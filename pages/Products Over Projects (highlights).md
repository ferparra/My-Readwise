	- “Product-mode” is a way of working. It is a way of funding and organizing
	      software development that differs significantly from the projects way of doing it.
	          Although generally applicable to digital-age enterprise IT, this way of working
	          is especially suited to those who aim to drive business through a digital platform.
	- An ideal product-mode team is an empowered, outcome-oriented, business-capability aligned, long-lived,
	      cross-functional, ideate-build-run team that is able to and expected to solve
	      problems and improve business outcomes, rather than deliver scope on schedule.

	- Colocation of application
	        level ops with dev also promotes better end-to-end iteration and better
	        understanding between developers and site reliability engineers.
	- Ability to Truly Iterate
	- Project teams can’t easily move out of scope-delivery for two reasons. First,
	        they are usually only meant to “build” the solution, not run it
	- Ownership allows a team evolve systems faster and
	        in a more controlled manner.

	- a clear demarcation of
	        ownership allows for accountable autonomy.
	- Tuckman’s theory of group
	        development asserts that a team goes through a series of suboptimal phases (forming,
	        storming, and norming) before it finds its groove in the performing phase.
	- Product-mode teams, being stable and long-lived can benefit
	        from a long performing phase.
	- Studies have identified autonomy, mastery, purpose and belongingness as key 
	                intrinsic motivators.
	- In product development, our greatest waste is not unproductive engineers, but
	          work products sitting idle in process queues.
	  
	  -- Donald G. Reinertsen
	- economies of flow come about
	        when the unit time of processing (end to end cycle time for a batch size of one –
	        single piece flow) reduces with an improvement in flow of processing
	- Build-only
	        project teams supported by lots of shared services may help achieve economies of
	        scale whereas ideate-build-run product-mode teams help achieve economies of
	        flow.
	- squads, each with its own outcomes, roadmap and systems under custody
	- go beyond the conventional
	        definition of a product as something that’s sold in the market, then it possible
	        to look at things like catalog as if it were a product
	- A transition from projects to product-mode is also meant to be a transition from
	          scope-delivery teams to problem-solving teams.
