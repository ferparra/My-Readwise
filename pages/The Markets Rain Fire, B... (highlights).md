	- The markets rain fire, but we do not cower, we deliver
	  
	  Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that it is here
	  
	  Blue metal + bronze
	  
	  Yearn + Synthetix 
	  
	  $YFI + $SNX

		- **Note**: Thread
	- Staking $SNX is not for the faint of heart
	  
	  It requires debt management, weekly transactions and high gas fees
	  
	  We're ending all that
	  
	  Starting today, users anywhere can deposit $SNX into a Yearn vault and stop micromanaging their positions ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance/status/1395413916080119810))
	- It was perhaps our most-requested vault and one of our most complex
	  
	  More than half a dozen devs have worked on it over eight weeks
	  
	  It could lead to our next $1 billion in TVL ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance/status/1395414079188127748))
	- Why?
	  
	  1/ Weekly claims will be handled automatically, so $SNX stakers don't have to do them by hand
	  
	  2/ Claims are done in a batch, which lowers the gas costs dramatically (recent claim txs have cost stakers $200+) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance/status/1395414265834745866))
	- 3/ Normally, $SNX stakers have exposure to the Synthetix debt pool. Yearn neutralizes debt exposure on the backend (much like we do for other CDP positions)
	  
	  4/ Accrued $SUSD will automatically deposited into Yearn's $SUSD vault to earn even more yield ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance/status/1395414472718798850))
	- Yearn's standard vault fees apply: 2% management fee + 20% performance fee. Both should be covered by savings in gas fees alone for most users.
	  
	  tldr: Yearn vaults will become the gold standard for $SNX staking moving forward ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance/status/1395414725811396612))
	- Come Spartans, let us stand üõ° to üõ° from here to Valhalla
