	- The 'Slicing Problem' is a thought experiment that challenges substrate-neutral computational theories of consciousness, which claim that certain forms of info processing are sufficient for consciousness. (2/9) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1604981564622110721))
	- We propose using 2D water-based logic gates to build a computer, and then "slice" the entire system along a redundant dimension, resulting in a "consciousness-multiplying exploit" (CME) where we claim it is meaningful to say that we've "doubled the amount of consciousness."

	- However, this leads to strange and absurd implications for theories of consciousness. Token theories must accept fragments of experience that don't belong to any experience, while type theories encounter ambiguous boundaries between conscious entities. (4/9) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1604981569059295232))
	- Therefore, we conclude that substrate-specific theories are necessary. This doesn't mean we must embrace Carbon Chauvinism or Epiphenomenalism, however‚Ä¶ (5/9) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1604981570858651648))
	- Physicalist theories can instead deal with the 'Slicing Problem' by having redundant qualia, where slicing is either impossible or reduces the amount of consciousness in each slice. (6/9) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1604981572578340864))
	- Our paper delves into the philosophical and ethical questions raised by the 'Slicing Problem' and discusses promising ways that physicalist theories can navigate this thought experiment. (7/9) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1604981574579064832))
	- Stay tuned! This is just the first paper of many QRI has in the pipeline to publish in peer-reviewed academic journals. (8/9) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1604981576332283905))
