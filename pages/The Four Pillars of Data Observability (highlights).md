	- observability is defined as a “measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs.”
	- Intensive properties do not depend on the size of material. For example, the temperature, density, pressure, and viscosity of a material does not depend on how much material there is. One cup of water can have the same temperature as an entire ocean.
	- “data about data that is independent of the data itself.”
	- Within the data world, the primary internal interaction is the derivation of one dataset from another. Datasets are derived from upstream data, and can be used to derive downstream data.
	- Without lineage, we do not know how different pieces of data depend on each other, making it difficult to analyze upstream root cause and downstream impact of data quality issues.
	- Until it’s feasible to store snapshots of data over time, we rely on storing approximations of our data, ala lossy compression
