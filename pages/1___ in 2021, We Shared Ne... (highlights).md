	- 2/ Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world's knowledge with the power, intelligence, and creativity of our large language models. It draws on information from the web to provide fresh, high-quality responses. Today we're opening Bard up to trusted external testers. https://t.co/QPy5BcERd6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1622673775182626818))
	- 3/ We'll combine their feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard's responses meet our high bar for quality, safety, and groundedness and we will make it more widely available in coming weeks. It's early, we will launch, iterate and make it better. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1622674009203834880))
	- 4/ As people turn to Google for deeper insights and understanding, AI can help us get to the heart of what they're looking for. We're starting with AI-powered features in Search that distill complex info into easy-to-digest formats so you can see the big picture then explore more

	- 5/ Developers can soon try our Generative Language API, initially powered by LaMDA with a range of models to follow. Over time, our goal is to create a set of tools and APIs that will make it easy for others to build more innovative applications with AI.
