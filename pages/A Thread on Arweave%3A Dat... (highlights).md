	- A thread on Arweave: data, comparisons, and things I find interesting ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlanaDLevin/status/1482434870475436033))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Arweave is a decentralized data storage protocol. Storage is permanent and the protocol employs a “pay-once store forever” model
	  
	  The ecosystem has been growing massively: from ~35 applications built using Arweave storage in October to ~65 just 3 months later

	- Bundlr may have sparked a lot of this growth. Launched in October, it enables users to pay for Arweave storage with non-Arweave tokens – Bundlr swaps those tokens to $AR on the backend and conducts the payment transaction with Arweave. Monthly transactions are up ~16x

	- Data usage is also up: from ~708 GB in August to 7.8TB (7800 GB) in December. From Jan-Aug 2021, Arweave stored 7.1 TB of data (cumulatively). Now, it stores more than that on a monthly basis

	- The graph for search interest looks pretty similar to the distribution of Arweave nodes. Engagement for both is strongest in China

	- China might be a leading indicator of broader adoption, in the same way that early Bitcoin interest concentrated heavily in countries w/ unstable govts & greater need for alts to existing solutions
	  
	  Censorship-resistant storage resonates most where censorship may be a real issue ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlanaDLevin/status/1482434890943582214))
	- It also seems that crypto-native apps will likely want crypto-native storage (as opposed to solutions like AWS or Google Cloud) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlanaDLevin/status/1482434892726214656))
	- As the broader crypto ecosystem grows, Arweave likely will too. It’s L1-agnostic, so whether Eth vs. Sol vs. AVAX etc. ends up being the most preferred chain shouldn’t significantly impact Arweave’s prospects ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlanaDLevin/status/1482434894584295426))
	- Arweave’s L1-agnosticism – sometimes referred to as being a “L0” – is highlighted by Arweave’s partnerships with different blockchains:
	  + Natively integrated with @0xPolygon 
	  + SOLAR Bridge with @solana 
	  + L1s that bridge via @KYVENetwork (incl. NEAR, Avax, Polkadot, and Cosmos) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlanaDLevin/status/1482434896333262851))
	- Notably, Arweave does have some competitors: mainly IPFS/Filecoin (they’re complementary protocols: FIL serves as an economic incentive for nodes to store IPFS data)
	  
	  The main differentiator is that Arweave offers permanent storage, whereas IPFS/Filecoin storage is pay-per-use ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlanaDLevin/status/1482434898426220547))
	- IPFS has a pretty rich ecosystem – including companies like Audius, Metamask, Augur, Brave, and Uniswap among its users. Over the last year, Arweave revenue looks tiny compared to Filecoin…

	- …but if you zoom in, that gap closes quite a bit. It’s worth noting that the decline seems to stem mostly from a decline in Filecoin’s revenue. Arweave protocol revenue has been growing (yet still pales in comparison to web2 companies that sell storage space, eg AWS)

	- Current fees on Arweave are ~$9.5/GB (for infinite storage; no time horizon). AWS is significantly less – about $0.015/GB per month

	- For AWS customers, $9.5/GB is equivalent to storing data for ~53 consecutive years
	  
	  That may seem like a long time but if the goal is to store data for hundreds of years, Arweave actually looks cheaper ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlanaDLevin/status/1482434912582250496))
	- Data storage is estimated to be a market worth 100s of billions. AWS revenue alone is ~$50B. So while Arweave is still an incredibly small player, there are a lot of positives:
	  + it’s early
	  + they’re going after a large market
	  + they have a well-differentiated position ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlanaDLevin/status/1482434914301755392))
	- Arweave has an all-star lineup of investors. Their last funding round was in March 2020 – they raised $8.3M to “re-invest directly into Arweave’s community.” The funds support Arweave Grants & Arweave Boost (a sort of accelerator program for teams building on Arweave)

	- Yet, importantly, token supply is still heavily weighted towards public ownership, with expectations that it’ll be fully public-owned within a few years (I believe year 0 is either 2017 or 2018):

	- For perspective, this is what other token allocations look like:

	- Finally, social interest is growing: the @ArweaveTeam twitter is up from ~9k followers in Jan 2021 to ~55k a year later
	  
	  There's also a rich ecosystem of news and tools, including @ArweaveNews @onlyarweave @Arweavers

	- Per a @a16z report by @cdixon and @eddylazzarin, social interest is an important metric to watch: it often brings new developers into the ecosystem and precedes protocol growth. I think this might be part of what we're seeing with Arweave

	- All in all, Arweave is an incredibly impressive project and I really enjoy following its growth
