	- Brockley Sprouts Are Different Than Brockly?
	  
	  Summary:
	  Sulphuripane is formed from a compound called glucorapinin, which is in the brockly. A study showed adding one gram of mustard seed powder to two year cooked brockley increases sulphurophane by fourfold. The idea of eating rob rockley 'just sounds horrible', but i like the way mustard seed sounds. So what i do is i will, you know, lightly steam my brockley, and then i add a little bit of my carigold butter a,. Then i add some mustard seed powder on the top of that. And if you don't taste that, it's expired, like it should have a little cake.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  Can we cook the brockley and still get these nutrients, or do we have to eat raw? I confess, eating raw brockley is really aversive to me.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So, the the sulphur pane is formed from a compound called glucorapinin, which is in the brockley. And the enzyme that converts it into sulphuripane is my rocinase. And it's heat sensitive. So you do somewhat lower the sulphuriphane levels when you, when you cook the brockle. However, there was a study a few years back that showed adding one gram of mustard seed powder, ground mustard seed powder, which also contain the myrocenes enzyne, to your cooked brockley increases the sulphuropane by fourfold.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So, so this is great, cause i confess i like brockley if it's cooked to the appropriate density. Ah, not too mushy, but definitely not raw. The idea of eating rob rockley to me just sounds horrible. But i like the way mustard seed sounds. So just a little bit of mustard seed powder added to the cooked brockle can recover some of these compounds, yes?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So what i do is i will, you know, lightly steam my brockle, and then i add a little bit of my carrigold butter a, and then i add some mustard seed powder on the top of that, it's got a little little kick, like it's just a little spice, you know. And if you don't taste that, it's expired, like it should have a little kick an.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Because i know people will want to know, how often and how much auow are you eating this every day, or most days of the week?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, i had shifted to supplementation with sulphuropane. I've ([Time 0:22:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ffcccbf4-7f1a-4c6b-9814-31cfb0112e4f))
	- Omega Three Fatty Acids
	  
	  Summary:
	  Omega three fatty acids are your super stars of nutrients for the brain and body. What other compounds or micronutrients do you a place in the top tier of useful interesting? There are animal studies, maybe therer hopefully also some human studies. We will get back heat and cold.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  And there is at least one preliminary stide that glutityon is increased in the brain after humans are, you know, basically taking sulphuriphane.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So, which is really for people isting. That's so important, because a number of compounds that people take in sublim form don't cross the blood braing barrier, or they get metal is in ways that what's listed on the bottle almost becomes irrelevant for what yourcelves actually experience. That's very reassuring. A, we wont get back to heat and cold. And thisa theme that i tried to serveice b. Just find it's too interesting to to diverge at this point, am, from from these themes. So what other compounds or nutrients do you a place in the top tier of useful interesting? There are animal studies, maybe there're, hopefully also some human studies. We've talked about a few. I know you've talked a lot about omega three fatty acids. So if you had to do your kind of top three m you're your stars of nutrients for the brain and body.

	- Do I Need a Prescription?
	  
	  Summary:
	  simon takes over the counter fish oil. He says it makes him feel better, but he doesn't have a prescription. Simon: I like to think that my platelets are slipperier and there thre their cruising through any little a obstructions in yy veins or arteries.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  To get a certain fish oil supplement thati separates them, ah, and so, you know, like lavaza, lavaza's a great one, and it's all like, in one and it's easier.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  What if somone doesn't have a prescription? So i take over the counter fish oil. I know, i feel bette, cause i've done the experiment of going on and off. I take them mainly for i don't have depression, but, a, my mood is better. My joints feel better. I just feel better. A, and i like to think that my platelets are slipperier, and there there, there you no cruising through any little, a, obstructions in my veins or arteries. That'sthe image i have in my head, but i don't haveany data to support that part. Ya.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I mean, so if you're asking for a leg, where do people get these?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Wella lit lock at the bottle, and it says, um, two grams per serving. But then i look and it's um 700 an 50 milligrams of e p a, right? Am, or a thousand milligrams of e p whats a half of it is e p then do i want to hit a threshold of e p a, or a threshold of of what's listed on the bottle, right on on the front of the bottle? And because my understanding is that we need to hit a threshold level of e p a in order to derive the i important benefits, i think two grams ism is a good threshold.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Now, on the international fish oil standards, i f s o, they have a web site where they do third party testing of a ton of different fish oil supplements from around the world. And they ([Time 0:45:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/db205da2-bec8-4a53-a7a2-7e03073fa459))
	- Do You Know What the Omega Three Index Is?
	  
	  Summary:
	  The omega three index is actually in the red blood cells. Red blood cells take dred and 20 days to turn over. If you're going to do a base line test, am, if you want to know before supplementing, what your level is,. You have to wait a hundred and 20 days before doing the second test after supplementing. Because te that's how long it takes for your red blood cell to turned over.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  The omega three index will be heavily biased by what you ate in the previous days.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  No, omega three index?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  O, so make you understood. I thouht you said, in red blood cells, if i ate salmon two days ago, my omega three index is going to go up. No, that was plasma.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I missumnest oo plasso, most people are measuring a if you look at a lot of studies, and honestly, andrew, i think a lot of the reason for conflicting data, it is because people are measuring plasma omega three levels, ok? Lip the phosphol its in a phospho lipid, right? Your phospho lipids are carrying things. These are lypo proteins. Ik they're carrying things like omega three, introglycerids and stuff, and shuttling them around. So am the omega three index is actually in the red blood cells. And red blood cells take a hundred and 20 days to turn over. So if you're going to do a base line test, if you want to know, before supplementing, what your level is, you have to wait a hundred and 20 days before doing the second test after supplementing, to know how much you went up, because the that's how long it takes for your red blood cell to turn over. So the omega three index on, bill harris has a a a company that he cofounded, is called omega quant and they measure the omega three index. They have a variety of different index test you can do, like a basic one, or a litle more advance is from a blood draw. It's a little blood spot thing. Ya? And m you know tha, he uses money to ([Time 1:07:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c76c5e1d-a976-44f7-b765-7ba652712d84))
	- Mita Condria - I'm Aging
	  
	  Summary:
	  I'm just curious, as a brief aside, before we talk about heat. What sort of carty, vascular or other types of training do you do? Do you do hit? I imagine you are doing high intense interval training. If you could just give us a sense of the contour of your, your week as it relates to exercised. And because you've been very gracious in sharing some of what you do for supplements and food, what about exercise? So no, and please, thank you for offering to, you knowi somehow filter the level detail, but i assure you that listeners of this podcast familiar with getting a drinking from the fire hose of mechanism. That was really helpful
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  When i hear mita condur by genesis, i'm like, aging, like, that's the first thing i think. Ah, so anyways, cold exposure, does thatmake other things as well?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So, noand please, thank you for offering to, you know, somehow filter the level detail. But i assure you that listeners of this pod casta familiar with getting a drinking from the fire hose of mechanism, and that was really helpful. And again, this is just one example of maybe four or five other things that you've said, at least that o're going to inspire me to change my behaviours, i wont o start doing some high intensity a iterval training. Doctor andy galpin was on this broadcast recently, and he told me that the subtle zone tu cardio and the weight training is great, but that i really shouldbe doing some max heart rate work per week. Your going into max's heart rate for 90 seconds, then resting and repeating that, maybe even mile repeats. I'm just curious, as a brief aside, before we talk about heat a, what, what sort of a cartio vascular or other types of training do you do? Do you do hit? I imagine you doing high intensiy interval training. If you could just give us a sense of the contour of your your week ([Time 2:08:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4a8db9da-daf6-476d-abac-5456bf7b2d84))
	- The Effects of Sanas on Cardebask Disease
	  
	  Summary:
	  Most of the studies that i just talked about were from m the the duration, the time spent in the sanna. So like 20 minutes is the sweet spot at about one 74 degrees fahrenheit. Men that were in the sana for only 11 minutes, even if they used it four to seven times a week, that reduction was only like eight % steat of 50.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  The university of eastern finland, and just one of the the world experts on sonna youths, especially with respect to cardio vascular health. What some of his data has also shown is that, a, if you look at the duration, the time spent in the sonna, so a lot of the, so i mention the temperature i do is about, i do like one 89 degrees fahrenheit. Typically. I go in there. I'm perty heat adapted and im so the more you do, the more you do the sawna, or any sort of heat stress, whether it's a hot tubbor jacuse im, you you become adapted your your basiy, start to sweat at a lower cor body temperature to cool yourself down. All these sort of physiological changes start to happen earlier. And so m i stay in for like 30 minutesmean, so i say along time, that's a lot. You have to listen to yor body. Most of the studies that i just talked about were from am the the duration, the time spent in the sonna, when i said 50 % reduction in cardbas disease related death. What was shown was that men that were in the sana for only 11 minutes, even if they used it four to seven times a week, that reduction was only like eight %. Stead of 50, it had to be greater than 19 minutes. So like 20 minutes is the sweet spot at about one 74 degrees fahrenheit. And so and most, most of the sanas in finland, by the way, they're, they're, they're humid. So they, ([Time 2:23:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dc20e723-51be-4c2d-ab39-f16fabd08365))
