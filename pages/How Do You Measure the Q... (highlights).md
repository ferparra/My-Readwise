	- How do you measure the query performance/hallucination on @gpt_index *without* ground-truth labels? ü§î
	  
	  Compare the synthesized text response with the retrieved sources! 
	  
	  Our new *evaluation module* allows you to do exactly that. Check out details below üßµ

	- When you query a @gpt_index data structure, you get back a synthesized response + retrieved sources.
	  
	  To evaluate: make another LLM call to see if response is supported by the sources.
	  
	  If at least one source matches, then you‚Äôre good ‚úÖ. If not, there may be hallucination! ‚ö†Ô∏è ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0/status/1641234017348653056))
	- But wait: what if you have a *lot* of sources to go through? So much that it‚Äôs bigger than the context window? 
	  
	  No problem: simply store the sources in our list index data structure üí™ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0/status/1641234019298967552))
	- Here‚Äôs an example. We query our tree index üéÑ, and run our evaluation module: check if the synthesized response matches the sources.
	  
	  Although the response is objectively correct, the source contains unrelated context (from 2015) - indicating hallucination!

	- Here‚Äôs another example: We query our vector index, and also run our evaluation module.
	  
	  We see that for both questions, the response matches the retrieved context, which is a good thing ‚≠êÔ∏è
