	- **Experience is indeed essential to science, but its role is different from that supposed by empiricism. It is not the source from which theories are derived.** **Its main use is to choose between theories that have already been guessed****.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8ntfe89jmh6fg3jw63azar))

	- Discovering a new explanation is inherently an act of creativity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8nv9z79s420bfvwxbtytsw))
		- **Tags**: #[[creativity]]
	- **The reason that testability is not enough is that prediction is not, and cannot be, the purpose of science**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8nwdkwnm68sd8aamhr13k3))
		- **Tags**: #[[hypothesis testing]] #[[science]]
	- That is relativism, the doctrine that statements in a given field cannot be objectively true or false: at most they can be judged so relative to some cultural or other arbitrary standard. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8nxg4gt9qn42sm6qna5g7h))
		- **Tags**: #[[relativism]]
	- every problem signals that our knowledge must be flawed or inadequate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8ny3tpc4a0bed4t0kas2zr))
	- we observe nothing directly anyway. **All observation is theory-laden.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8nycswz4zeew77kfh3swe0))
		- **Tags**: #[[observability]]
	- **anti-anthropocentrism has increasingly been elevated to the status of a universal principle, sometimes called** **the ‘Principle of Mediocrity’: there is nothing significant about humans** (in the cosmic scheme of things). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8nz8razf76dm77fyztq3tg))
	- ‘the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pc4hbbkst67drsjm8yrvh))
	- every putative physical transformation, to be performed in a given time with given resources or under any other conditions, is either – impossible because it is forbidden by the laws of nature; or – achievable, given the right knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pcs67ga6dsyfy455fznyq))
	- everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pczz7jrf0wkt4jj3jh2bt))
	- the only process known to be capable of creating knowledge is biological evolution. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pdqw32zfqyyr9qkp5h9tr))
		- **Tags**: #[[evolution]]
	- good adaptations, like good explanations, are distinguished by being hard to vary while still fulfilling their functions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pe8xgq7dmxttrbb205b95))
	- Human brains and DNA molecules each have many functions, but among other things they are general-purpose information-storage media ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pejhc443w546qw6s9c1sn))
		- **Tags**: #[[dna]]
	- a gene conferring the ability to digest a certain type of food causes the organism to remain healthy in some situations where it would otherwise weaken or die ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pfx4hz0xz8qv4g8gawat9))
		- **Tags**: #[[neo-darwinism]] #[[dna]]
	- increases the organism’s chances of having offspring in the future, and those offspring would inherit, and spread, copies of the gene. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pggvbpax3rq8tkt9rj27w))
		- **Tags**: #[[neo-darwinism]] #[[dna]]
	- Ideas can be replicators too. For example, a good joke is a replicator: when lodged in a person’s mind, it has a tendency to cause that person to tell it to other people, thus copying it into their minds. Dawkins coined the term memes (rhymes with ‘dreams’) for ideas that are replicators. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8phbnzzre7f8hfentw64da))

	- Hofstadter eventually concludes that the ‘I’ is an illusion. Minds, he concludes, can’t ‘push material stuff around’, because ‘physical law alone would suffice to determine [its] behaviour’. Hence his reductionism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pm3jwcxs5xt8vq9ghtv2m))
		- **Tags**: #[[mind]] #[[@hofstadter]]
	- there is an objective difference between right and wrong: those are real attributes of objectives and behaviours. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pn9kq903a7v7r73yqfyp1))
	- First the brain was supposed to be like an immensely complicated set of gears and levers. Then it was hydraulic pipes, then steam engines, then telephone exchanges – and, now that computers are our most impressive technology, brains are said to be computers. But this is still no more than a metaphor, says Searle, and there is no more reason to expect the brain to be a computer than a steam engine. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pq7ks1vc4t4cnpab50t2j))
	- Lady Lovelace’s objection has almost the same logic as Douglas Hofstadter’s argument for reductionism (Chapter 5) – yet Hofstadter is one of today’s foremost proponents of the possibility of AI. That is because **both of them share the mistaken premise that low-level computational steps cannot possibly add up to a higher-level ‘I’ that affects anything**. The difference between them is that they chose opposite horns of the dilemma that that poses: Lovelace chose the false conclusion that AI is impossible, while Hofstadter chose the false conclusion that no such ‘I’ can exist.

	- the nature of consciousness (or any other computational task): if you can’t program it, you haven’t understood it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pt31wt6mpgvk1k6d02pqe))
		- **Tags**: #[[consciousness]]
	- **But his test is rooted in the empiricist mistake of seeking a purely behavioural criterion: it requires the judge to come to a conclusion without any explanation of how the candidate AI is supposed to work. But, in reality,** **judging whether something is a genuine AI will always depend on explanations of how it works.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8ptqh81tj1w90d48gms858))
		- **Tags**: #[[ai]]
	- The test is only about **who designed the AI’s utterances: who adapted its utterances to be meaningful – who created the knowledge in them? If it was the designer, then the program is not an AI. If it was the program itself, then it is an AI.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pv6wkws85zq8tr38w97rn))
		- **Tags**: #[[ai]]
	- even if chatbots did at some point start becoming much better at imitating humans (or at fooling humans), that would still not be a path to AI ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pvs0605hb4nrza0ebnah7))
	- There is a philosophy whose basic tenet is that those are the same. It is called behaviourism – which is instrumentalism applied to psychology. In other words, it is the doctrine that psychology can only, or should only, be the science of behaviour, not of minds; that it can only measure and predict relationships between people’s external circumstances (‘stimuli’) and their observed behaviours (‘responses’). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pw81pmyzfmpch3fkrf901))

	- The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pxwb17ge23cxemt8ndm8t))
		- **Tags**: #[[futurism]]
	- Can we be sure that our present knowledge, too, is not riddled with dangerous gaps and misconceptions? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pyckvjv2zh6zj3x55jmav))
	- asymmetry between what he called the ‘power of population’ and the ‘power of production’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8q8ef4y56bktj70qwp1eg4))
	- They all thought they were making sober predictions based on the best knowledge available to them. In reality they were all allowing themselves to be misled by the ineluctable fact of the human condition that we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8q8thn5ywvvfyr1f12cbwp))
	- The Principle of Optimism: All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8q9ep9kzxcp2nf58yths97))

	- Problems are soluble ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8qa7h8ch8j0sy8s55tsa33))

	- a good theory – if it is a superb theory, as the fundamental theories of physics nowadays are – then it is exceedingly hard to vary while still remaining a viable explanation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8qb1m8c2y2qcgrv9yxg4fk))
	- The way to converge with each other is to converge upon the truth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8qbth9g840kgqzshcpfwhv))
