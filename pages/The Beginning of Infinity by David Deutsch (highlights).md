	- **Experience is indeed essential to science, but its role is different from that supposed by empiricism. It is not the source from which theories are derived.** **Its main use is to choose between theories that have already been guessed****.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8ntfe89jmh6fg3jw63azar))
		- **Tags**: #[[empiricism]]
	- Discovering a new explanation is inherently an act of creativity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8nv9z79s420bfvwxbtytsw))
		- **Tags**: #[[creativity]]
	- **The reason that testability is not enough is that prediction is not, and cannot be, the purpose of science**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8nwdkwnm68sd8aamhr13k3))
		- **Tags**: #[[hypothesis testing]] #[[science]]
	- That is relativism, the doctrine that statements in a given field cannot be objectively true or false: at most they can be judged so relative to some cultural or other arbitrary standard. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8nxg4gt9qn42sm6qna5g7h))
		- **Tags**: #[[relativism]]
	- every problem signals that our knowledge must be flawed or inadequate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8ny3tpc4a0bed4t0kas2zr))
	- we observe nothing directly anyway. **All observation is theory-laden.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8nycswz4zeew77kfh3swe0))
		- **Tags**: #[[observability]]
	- **anti-anthropocentrism has increasingly been elevated to the status of a universal principle, sometimes called** **the ‘Principle of Mediocrity’: there is nothing significant about humans** (in the cosmic scheme of things). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8nz8razf76dm77fyztq3tg))
	- ‘the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pc4hbbkst67drsjm8yrvh))
	- every putative physical transformation, to be performed in a given time with given resources or under any other conditions, is either – impossible because it is forbidden by the laws of nature; or – achievable, given the right knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pcs67ga6dsyfy455fznyq))
	- everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pczz7jrf0wkt4jj3jh2bt))
	- the only process known to be capable of creating knowledge is biological evolution. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pdqw32zfqyyr9qkp5h9tr))
		- **Tags**: #[[evolution]]
	- good adaptations, like good explanations, are distinguished by being hard to vary while still fulfilling their functions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pe8xgq7dmxttrbb205b95))
	- Human brains and DNA molecules each have many functions, but among other things they are general-purpose information-storage media ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pejhc443w546qw6s9c1sn))
		- **Tags**: #[[dna]]
	- a gene conferring the ability to digest a certain type of food causes the organism to remain healthy in some situations where it would otherwise weaken or die ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pfx4hz0xz8qv4g8gawat9))
		- **Tags**: #[[neo-darwinism]] #[[dna]]
	- increases the organism’s chances of having offspring in the future, and those offspring would inherit, and spread, copies of the gene. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pggvbpax3rq8tkt9rj27w))
		- **Tags**: #[[neo-darwinism]] #[[dna]]
	- Ideas can be replicators too. For example, a good joke is a replicator: when lodged in a person’s mind, it has a tendency to cause that person to tell it to other people, thus copying it into their minds. Dawkins coined the term memes (rhymes with ‘dreams’) for ideas that are replicators. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8phbnzzre7f8hfentw64da))
		- **Tags**: #[[society]] #[[memes]] #[[social science]]
	- Hofstadter eventually concludes that the ‘I’ is an illusion. Minds, he concludes, can’t ‘push material stuff around’, because ‘physical law alone would suffice to determine [its] behaviour’. Hence his reductionism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pm3jwcxs5xt8vq9ghtv2m))
		- **Tags**: #[[mind]] #[[@hofstadter]]
	- there is an objective difference between right and wrong: those are real attributes of objectives and behaviours. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pn9kq903a7v7r73yqfyp1))
	- First the brain was supposed to be like an immensely complicated set of gears and levers. Then it was hydraulic pipes, then steam engines, then telephone exchanges – and, now that computers are our most impressive technology, brains are said to be computers. But this is still no more than a metaphor, says Searle, and there is no more reason to expect the brain to be a computer than a steam engine. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pq7ks1vc4t4cnpab50t2j))
	- Lady Lovelace’s objection has almost the same logic as Douglas Hofstadter’s argument for reductionism (Chapter 5) – yet Hofstadter is one of today’s foremost proponents of the possibility of AI. That is because **both of them share the mistaken premise that low-level computational steps cannot possibly add up to a higher-level ‘I’ that affects anything**. The difference between them is that they chose opposite horns of the dilemma that that poses: Lovelace chose the false conclusion that AI is impossible, while Hofstadter chose the false conclusion that no such ‘I’ can exist. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8prbcpmwgbkep92fpmwjt5))
		- **Tags**: #[[ai]] #[[@hofstadter]] #[[@lovelace]]
	- the nature of consciousness (or any other computational task): if you can’t program it, you haven’t understood it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pt31wt6mpgvk1k6d02pqe))
		- **Tags**: #[[consciousness]]
	- **But his test is rooted in the empiricist mistake of seeking a purely behavioural criterion: it requires the judge to come to a conclusion without any explanation of how the candidate AI is supposed to work. But, in reality,** **judging whether something is a genuine AI will always depend on explanations of how it works.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8ptqh81tj1w90d48gms858))
		- **Tags**: #[[ai]]
	- The test is only about **who designed the AI’s utterances: who adapted its utterances to be meaningful – who created the knowledge in them? If it was the designer, then the program is not an AI. If it was the program itself, then it is an AI.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pv6wkws85zq8tr38w97rn))
		- **Tags**: #[[ai]]
	- even if chatbots did at some point start becoming much better at imitating humans (or at fooling humans), that would still not be a path to AI ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pvs0605hb4nrza0ebnah7))
	- There is a philosophy whose basic tenet is that those are the same. It is called behaviourism – which is instrumentalism applied to psychology. In other words, it is the doctrine that psychology can only, or should only, be the science of behaviour, not of minds; that it can only measure and predict relationships between people’s external circumstances (‘stimuli’) and their observed behaviours (‘responses’). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pw81pmyzfmpch3fkrf901))
		- **Tags**: #[[psychology]] #[[behaviourism]]
	- The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pxwb17ge23cxemt8ndm8t))
		- **Tags**: #[[futurism]]
	- Can we be sure that our present knowledge, too, is not riddled with dangerous gaps and misconceptions? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8pyckvjv2zh6zj3x55jmav))
	- asymmetry between what he called the ‘power of population’ and the ‘power of production’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8q8ef4y56bktj70qwp1eg4))
	- They all thought they were making sober predictions based on the best knowledge available to them. In reality they were all allowing themselves to be misled by the ineluctable fact of the human condition that we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8q8thn5ywvvfyr1f12cbwp))
	- The Principle of Optimism: All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8q9ep9kzxcp2nf58yths97))
		- **Tags**: #[[optimism]]
	- Problems are soluble ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8qa7h8ch8j0sy8s55tsa33))
		- **Tags**: #[[problem solving]]
	- a good theory – if it is a superb theory, as the fundamental theories of physics nowadays are – then it is exceedingly hard to vary while still remaining a viable explanation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8qb1m8c2y2qcgrv9yxg4fk))
	- The way to converge with each other is to converge upon the truth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8qbth9g840kgqzshcpfwhv))

	- Dollars in bank accounts are what may be called ‘configurational’ entities: they are states or configurations of objects, not what we usually think of as physical objects in their own right. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq9rt5548pe53begmbcsshs4))
		- **Tags**: #[[representations]] #[[currency]] #[[money]]
	- Another example of fungible configurational entities in classical physics is amounts of energy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq9rv3hsm152aj9azmn27tp7))
	- There is only one known phenomenon which, if it ever occurred, would have effects that did not fall off with distance, and that is the creation of a certain type of knowledge, namely a beginning of infinity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq9rvyyfjp5d00a78rtsqaq5))
	- The number of distinct histories will now increase rapidly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq9rwh45edh65js2dexcwwac))
	- In entangled objects, further splitting happens instead of interference. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq9rws7ed71mgmgrhcng4fz3))
		- **Tags**: #[[quantum mechanics]]
	- positive and negative charges attract each other and, if unrestrained, accelerate towards each other, emitting energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation as they go ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq9rxnrq14egksfcysnj9tx2))
		- **Tags**: #[[electromagnetism]]
	- w**henever a measurement is made, all the histories but one cease to exist. The surviving one is chosen at random, with the probability of each possible outcome being equal to the total measure of all the histories in which that outcome occurs.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq9rzj7xw8xqntxfvpttb7dm))
	- One currently influential philosophical movement goes under various names such as postmodernism, deconstructionism and structuralism, depending on historical details that are unimportant here. It claims that because all ideas, including scientific theories, are conjectural and impossible to justify, they are essentially arbitrary: they are no more than stories, known in this context as ‘narratives’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq9s3dwnrqsxp8c0wbwg6krs))
		- **Tags**: #[[philosophy]]
	- Creating a successful postmodernist theory is indeed purely a matter of meeting the criteria of the postmodernist community – which have evolved to be complex, exclusive and authority-based. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq9s4rr5yxqf3116f1rkj0n3))
		- **Tags**: #[[post-modernism]]
	- a generic feature of experimentation is that the bigger the errors you make, either in the numbers or in your naming and interpretation of the measured quantities, the more exciting the results are, if true ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq9s66qwz8sxcdjf4m7s0at9))
		- **Tags**: #[[narrative building]] #[[experimentation]]
	- In the ‘hard sciences’ – which usually do good science – false results due to all sorts of errors are nevertheless common. But they are corrected when their explanations are criticized and tested. That cannot happen in explanationless science. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq9s6ybjqj5pkdtfs6a588p1))

	- Popper’s criterion **Good political institutions are those that make it as easy as possible to detect whether a ruler or policy is a mistake, and to remove rulers or policies without violence when they are.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqc1yesyrbc7x91e2k5yh5nq))
		- **Tags**: #[[@karl-popper]]
	- It is a mistake to conceive of choice and decision-making as a process of selecting from existing options according to a fixed formula. That omits the most important element of decision-making, namely the creation of new options. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqc1z00gbbvyr02zvzxsvepb))
		- **Tags**: #[[decision making]]
	- [[rational thinking]] does not consist of weighing the justifications of rival theories, but of using conjecture and criticism to seek the best explanation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqc1zbppwex5a0fvkkbnpy69))
		- **Tags**: #[[rationalism]]
	- **Following a plurality-voting election, the usual outcome is that the party with the largest total number of votes has an overall majority in the legislature, and therefore takes sole charge**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqc1zzpcntftsq50npv3amt2))

	- We have an inborn aversion to heights and to falling, yet people go skydiving – not in spite of this feeling, but because of it. It is that very feeling of inborn aversion that humans can reinterpret into a larger picture which to them is attractive – they want more of it; they want to appreciate it more deeply. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqc213jv3wt5y24knr1weq82))
	- We find flowers beautiful that we have never seen before, and which have not been known to our culture before – and quite reliably, for most humans in most cultures. The same is not true of the roots of plants, or the leaves. Why only the flowers? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqc21gqncma6mmm2z7hrvsyy))
		- **Tags**: #[[wonder]] #[[novelty]]
	- the attribute we call beauty is of two kinds. One is a parochial kind of attractiveness, local to a species, to a culture or to an individual. The other is unrelated to any of those: it is universal, and as objective as the laws of physics ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqc22h63526q46rx7c96k71n))
		- **Tags**: #[[beauty]]
	- **The fact that flowers reliably seem beautiful to humans when their designs evolved for an apparently unrelated purpose is evidence that beauty is objective.** **Those convergent criteria of beauty solve the problem of creating hard-to-forge signals where prior shared knowledge is insufficient to provide them.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqc230tjzt1e63vqkzfhnqwd))

	- when such memes do change, what are the conditions under which they can change for the better? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqc23m9hpwxsw82ar2mb12b6))
		- **Tags**: #[[society]] #[[culture]] #[[memes]]
	- A meme exists in a brain form and a behaviour form, and each is copied to the other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqc247h5r6hdht92k7xm5xb7))
		- **Tags**: #[[memetic theory]] #[[memes]]
	- Thus, memes of this new kind, which are created by rational and critical thought, subsequently also depend on such thought to get themselves replicated faithfully. So I shall call them rational memes. Memes of the older, static-society kind, which survive by disabling their holders’ critical faculties, I shall call anti-rational memes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqc25h800x4ba3565bvvx4j0))
		- **Tags**: #[[memetic theory]]
	- Consider what we should expect to happen when a static society is gradually switching from anti-rational to rational memes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqc264cxcs3g3x06tykvqddc))

		- **Tags**: #[[mimetic theory]] #[[memetic theory]]
	- So there is no such thing as ‘just imitating the behaviour’ – still less, therefore, can one discover those ideas by imitating it. **One needs to know the ideas before one can imitate the behaviour.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqc27cf0v5e6hjvg8qfswd5r))
		- **Tags**: #[[creativity]]
	- **But humans do not especially copy any behaviour. They use conjecture, criticism and experiment to create good explanations of the meaning of things – other people’s behaviour, their own, and that of the world in general. That is what creativity does.** **And if we end up behaving like other people, it is because we have rediscovered the same idea.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqc27ssfedtvgs95m78bmecq))
		- **Tags**: #[[creativity]]

	- The Easter Islanders may or may not have suffered a forest-management fiasco. But, if they did, **the explanation would not be about why they made mistakes – problems are inevitable – but why they failed to correct them.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcdb7523sqtk32ytgcj1xsy))
		- **Tags**: #[[risk]]
	- progress is sustainable, indefinitely. But only by people who engage in a particular kind of thinking and behaviour – the problem-solving and problem-creating kind characteristic of the Enlightenment. And that requires the optimism of a dynamic society. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcdc2pawyrw1933064gmmj4))
	- The Easter Island civilization collapsed because no human situation is free of new problems, and static societies are inherently unstable in the face of new problems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcdcz9mbkqp5ea3r61eq0tx))
		- **Tags**: #[[civilization]]
	- In the optimistic conception – the one that was unforeseeably vindicated by events – people are problem-solvers: creators of the unsustainable solution and hence also of the next problem. In the pessimistic conception, that distinctive ability of people is a disease for which sustainability is the cure. In the optimistic one, sustainability is the disease and people are the cure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcde741wv1wv68tw6y9sdpd))
	- As the economist David Friedman has remarked, **most people believe that an income of about twice their own should be sufficient to satisfy any reasonable person** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcdp6qgj8pgw2h658c9w1p6))
	- Perhaps a more practical way of stressing the same truth would be to frame the growth of knowledge (all knowledge, not only scientific) as a continual transition from problems to better problems, rather than from problems to solutions or from theories to better theories ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcdph6513y6gq9vbq9t04k1))

	- There is only one way of thinking that is capable of making progress, or of surviving in the long run, and that is the way of seeking good explanations through creativity and criticism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcdrj4yv8ajm5mfnwn09b54))
