	- My top 5 tools as a PM: Loom, Figma, Notion, Linear and Sourcegraph.
	  
	  Today we’re diving into @loom. The best tool for PMs to communicate async with their team and cut down on meeting time.
	  
	  Here’s a breakdown the product and how I use it: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1597311879713390598))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ The product
	  
	  Loom is a video recording app that allows you to record your screen and yourself (optional). They have a Mac app as well as a chrome extension, and enables teams to share a library of recorded videos.

	- 2/ The product - integrations
	  
	  Slack, Notion, Linear, Medium, etc. are all integrated with Loom for videos to be embedded.
	  
	  Ofc it also integrates w every PMs fave project management tool, Jira. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1597311895043657729))
	- 3/ The product - pricing
	  
	  The best part. If you’re recording videos <5 mins, it’s free (even if you’re part of a team).
	  
	  Otherwise it’s $8/user/month. Totally worth it to save just 30 mins a month.
	  
	  I save hours each month by replacing meetings with short Loom recordings.

	- 4/ The product - reactions + comments
	  
	  Being able to drop emoji reactions at specific timestamps is s small surprise & delight feature.
	  
	  Ability to add and record comments is huge. This replaces the back-and-forth in mtgs, and way more valuable than 1-way videos.

	- 5/ Use Cases - PRD Handoff
	  
	  What I do most often: I record a loom to walkthrough the context, goals & requirements in the PRD, & the designs in Figma. This allows anyone to easily pick up a PRD, watch a 1.25x speed loom and get a refresher as they context switch to a new feature.

	- 6/ Use Cases - Design Iterations
	  
	  Extensive Figma comments gets overwhelming so the go-to move is to grab time on your designer’s calendar to discuss.
	  
	  Or, you can drop comments where appropriate then record a 5 min loom where you voice over your thoughts, saving you 25 mins. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1597311920234631168))
	- 7/ Use Cases - Sharing Progress with Stakeholders
	  
	  Every stakeholder wants to see progress on a requested feature. Some don’t have access (or know how to use) Figma, others want an eng demo.
	  
	  Usually you’d schedule a mtg. Or you can record a 2 min loom and save 28 mins. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jenyangwong/status/1597311922742841344))
