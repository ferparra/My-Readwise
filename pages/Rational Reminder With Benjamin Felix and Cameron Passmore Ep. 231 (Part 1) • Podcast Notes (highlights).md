document_note:: Ben Felix and Cameron Passmore discuss the basics of rational investing, including why people invest, risk and return, discount rates, market pricing, different types of risk, expected and unexpected returns, building an optimal portfolio, employer stock considerations, emergency funds for recessions, direct real estate vs REITs, and the impact of financial fragility. They emphasize that investors invest to earn a positive real return on their investment, that bond investors have fixed returns and equity investors have uncertain returns, and that the market price is a good representation of all relevant information. They also advise that having an emergency fund and building financial resiliency are important considerations when preparing for recessions.
