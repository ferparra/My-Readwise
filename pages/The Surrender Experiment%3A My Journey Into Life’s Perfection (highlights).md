document_note:: In The Surrender Experiment, Mickey Singer describes his journey into meditation and his surrender experiment, which is the practice of letting go of control and allowing the flow of life to take him where it wants. He suggests that aiming to control everything can cause stress and pain, but you can still use your free will to participate in the flow of life. He also talks about separating yourself from your thoughts and emotions, and having compassion for the human part of you, including all its faults and weaknesses. Mickey's journey ended up leading him from a focus on self to one focused on serving others, and this book is a beautiful reminder of the power of surrender.
