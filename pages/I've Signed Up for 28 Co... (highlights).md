	- I've signed up for 28 courses that I haven't finished. Who else has this problem?
	  
	  Those of us who struggle to complete self-paced courses need a way to get the benefits of Cohort Based Courses(CBCs) - accountability and community
	  
	  Enter Course Clubs

	- Course Clubs are like book clubs but for courses. They offer a community for support, accountability, and feedback.   
	  
	  They are a way for people taking self-paced courses to get the benefits of a CBC.
	  
	  Why not just take a CBC?

	- CBCs are the gold standard of online learning. They provide motivation, feedback, and accountability.
	  
	  However, they're not accessible to everyone. They're expensive, they don't cover every topic, and there can be timing and time zone issues

	- Self-paced courses are more accessible. They're cheaper, they cover almost every subject, and you can fit them around your schedule. 
	  
	  But they also need time, energy, and especially discipline. 
	  
	  These are obviously high hurdles - how many courses have you not finished?

	- Self-paced courses lack many of the features that make CBCs so successful for students. 
	  
	  So whatâ€™s the solution?
	  
	  Course Clubs.

	- Theyâ€™re communities built around self-paced courses. They help you stay on track, create engagement, and provide proof-of-work
	  
	  Everything you need to gain the skills you want
	  
	  You bought the course in order to be the best version of yourself. Course Clubs make that happen.

	- Hereâ€™s how to start a Course Club:

	  2.  Buy the course.
	  3.  Design a schedule for when to watch/read the modules.
	  4.  Develop a weekly project for engagement and to apply the ideas.
