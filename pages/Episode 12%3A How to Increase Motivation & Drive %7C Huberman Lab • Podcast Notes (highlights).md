	- Dopamine is involved in wanting – not having – the excitement or anticipation about something increases dopamine firing 30-40x
	- Dopamine motivates you to take action toward the thing you want
	- Novelty is the number one trigger of dopamine release
	- A subtle feature about the dopamine system: for every bit of dopamine that’s released, there’s a crash associated when prolactin is released
	- Prolactin is behind the feeling of “what’s next” or letdown after a big goal
	- Dopamine make us focus on things outside of us that we have to chase; serotonin makes us content with the here and now
	- To maintain high levels of motivation, try intermittent reward: celebrate successes every other time, every tenth time, etc. to blunt dopamine response, prevent a crash, and keep you on the path to bigger goals
	- Dopamine biases us toward thinking about things we don’t have; serotonin, cannabinoids, and other “here and now” molecules make us content in the present
	- Serotonin is the molecule of bliss and contentment for what you already have
	- Dopamine can cause high achievers to become manipulative and unpleasant: “Dopamine doesn’t care how you reach your goals, it only cares that you reach your goals.” – Dr. Andrew Huberman
	- Two types of procrastinators: (1) people who enjoy the stress of impending deadline – tapping into epinephrine system – which activates action in the body; (2) people who are simply not releasing enough dopamine
