	- Will the Algorithm Show Louise to Aaron?
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* The algorithm can leave daters who depend on it wanting, as it can be based on group behaviors rather than individual preferences., * To avoid these kinds of misconnections, Zhen decided to build more granularity into the system.)

	  Speaker 1
	  So then you have Louise, who is 6'4, and only sees people who are at least 5'10 on the app.
	  
	  Speaker 5
	  But for this particular person, the algorithm might realize that sometimes when we recommend someone who's 5'6, but with all these other features, the user could show particular interests, right? And then I can build that into the algorithm.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  But Louise also loves music, and he also matches with people who are really into 70's prog rock. Aaron fits this bill. He wants to take a date to see Jethro Tal. He could be a match. But he's 5'6". Will the app show Aaron to Louise? Will Louise be freed from the tyranny of the tall people bubble?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Oh my god, you're killing me. What happens?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, their fate is in the hands of the algorithm. If it makes inferences based on certain kinds of group behaviors, like tall people are into other tall people, it would actually keep Louise and Aaron apart. To avoid these kinds of misconnections, Zhen decided to build more granularity into the system.
	  
	  Speaker 5
	  We made the algorithm more personalized, really have the algorithm learn more about the user's preferences over time, not treating people as groups or only look at their average behavior, but look at the individual preferences.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  What all this tells us is that these algorithms can leave the daters who depend on them wanting.
	  
	  Speaker 5
	  If I'm Asian, do I only get to see Asian profiles? And maybe that's not what I'm interested in, but in the end, this is the impact of the algorithm. And then it could actually lead to outcomes of matches. And how do we quantify the loss of welfare for individuals like that?
