	- I recently got a lot smarter because of a podcast done by Naval Ravikant and Brett Hall. 
	  
	  In great clarity, they explained and summarized the book, 'The Beginning of Infinity', by David Deutsch.
	  
	  Here are all the ways my worldview has changed as a result:ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983249031217152))

	- Before I continue, I want to shoutout @naval, @ToKTeacher, and @DavidDeutschOxf. Many of these tweets are direct quotes from one of them.
	  
	  They are all geniuses and their own right. I appreciate how listening to them makes me think deeper about the big problems. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983250016980993))
	- Science is the study of truth. It is an explanatory framework and an error correcting mechanism. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983251057053696))
	- If you understand these four fundamental theories, you can understand how everything works:
	  -Quantum Theory
	  -Theory of Computation
	  -Epistemology
	  -Evolution by Natural Selection
	  
	  Understanding these theories can be done by one person. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983251967234052))
	- Good explanations areâ€¦
	  -acts of creativity
	  -testify-able and falsifiable.
	  -hard to vary.
	  -precise.
	  -narrow and risky. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983252923625474))

	- A scientific theory is a subset of a good explanation. They are a dime a dozen. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983253846380554))
	- Transformation happens because of knowledge. 
	  
	  With knowledge, we will be able to shape our planet, our solar system, and even the galaxy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983254693580804))
	- Physical laws cannot predict humans impact on the universe. 
	  
	  Nobody can predict what impact knowledge will have moving forward. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983255607947267))
	- Pessimistic worldviews come from linear extrapolations of negative trends while ignoring positive trends. 
	  
	  Positive trends come from creativity, which is inherently unpredictable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983256455188486))
	- Humans are problem solvers and can solve all problems.
	  
	  Itâ€™s all knowable. Itâ€™s all knowable by humans. We are at the beginning of an infinity of knowledge. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983257377943556))
	- Humans are unique in our ability to understand things. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983258472685571))
	- No number of white swans can prove the existence of a black swan. 
	  
	  You can never establish final truth. This includes mathematics. 
	  
	  There are just good explanations replaced by better explanations. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983259378655232))
	- Mathematics is an art. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983260410421255))
	- Academic culture teaches us that: 
	  -Mathematics is certain.
	  -Science is mostly certain.
	  -Philosophy is a matter of opinion. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983261324816391))
	- All knowledge is conjecture. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983262457184256))
	- Every mathematical theory is held within a physical substrate. As a result, we are always bound by the laws of physics. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983263262547970))
	- If the laws of physics were different, we could prove different theorems. The theorems we cannot prove that are outside of the laws of physics in this universe are inherently boring. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983264076242951))
	- All probability is subjective. If you donâ€™t know the outcome of an event, that is because you donâ€™t know. 
	  
	  There is no uncertainty in the universe. Anything that can happen, will happen. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983265078628362))
	- You occupy a single universe. The result of your actions may occupy many. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983265976262659))
	- Almost everything of interest that you know about in the universe is unobserved. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983266861207560))
	- Trial-and-error is the way that complex systems improve themselves over time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983267695923205))
	- Bayesian reasoning and induction are only good for finite spaces that are known. They donâ€™t help you discover new knowledge and new explanations. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983268652171264))
	- There is an infinite number of things that you do not know that could affect the things that you do know. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983269621108740))
	- We will never have the final word. We will always be at the beginning of infinity. Rational optimism is the way out. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsxyz/status/1422983270476693504))
	- This isn't even close to the wealth of knowledge held within this 60-minute podcast episode.
	  
	  And I'm sure it's nothing compared to the actual text, The Beginning of Infinity!
