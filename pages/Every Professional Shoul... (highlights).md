	- Every professional should ultralearn.
	  
	  We need to keep acquiring new skills to thrive in the digital age. But how do you learn when you're already overwhelmed?
	  
	  You run well-defined learning projects.
	  
	  Here's how the ultralearning framework gives you a competitive advantage: üßµ

	- What is ultralearning?
	  
	  It's an intense, self-directed way of learning skills fast.
	  
	  When you ultralearn, you take complete ownership over your progress towards a goal *you* have set for yourself.
	  
	  But ultralearning is not for everyone; you must have [[skin in the game]]. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1617990669892726784))
	- The world is changing fast; learn to adapt.
	  
	  Ultralearning enables you to quickly learn the knowledge and skills needed to change direction in life.
	  
	  Lost your job?
	  
	  Don't go back to college.
	  
	  Instead, pick a goal and learn everything you need to reach it. That's ultralearning. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1617990672501571584))
	- Ultralearning rests on 9 principles:
	  
	  1) [[Metalearning]]
	  2) Focus
	  3) Directness
	  4) Drill
	  5) Retrieval
	  6) Feedback
	  7) Retention
	  8) Intuition
	  9) Experimentation
	  
	  In the coming weeks, I'll dive into each principle. But let's get started with a summary ‚¨áÔ∏è ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1617990675123023874))
	- Before you learn, [[metalearn]].
	  
	  [[Metalearning]] is the process of planning and strategizing your learning project before diving into a new subject or skill.
	  
	  [[Metalearning]] is one of the core principles to avoid pitfalls and set yourself up for success. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1617990677694156801))
	- To learn fast, you need to focus.
	  
	  Finding focus is difficult in our distracted world, but it's crucial to learn faster than the rest.
	  
	  That's why ultralearners set specific goals, break down tasks, and create distraction-less spaces. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1617990680311390211))
	- Always aim for direct learning.
	  
	  Don't get stuck reading about your skill without actually practicing it.
	  
	  The principle of directness teaches that if you want to learn fast, you must practice what you want to achieve.
	  
	  Practice as you play. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1617990682924437505))
	- Smash through plateaus with drills.
	  
	  Attack your weak points through deliberate practice, and you won't get stuck for long.
	  
	  Drills shorten the feedback loop and show how you're progressing. They also help to improve focus and discipline to keep going. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1617990685499740161))
	- To remember, recall from memory.
	  
	  The more often you retrieve a bit of knowledge from your brain, the easier it becomes to remember.
	  
	  So challenge yourself.
	  
	  Think deeply to solve problems, and see where your understanding is lacking.
	  
	  That's how you learn long-term. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1617990688091799552))
	- Always seek feedback when learning.
	  
	  Without feedback, it's impossible to know if you're improving. So look for feedback while and after you practice.
	  
	  But feedback will only be helpful if you know where you're going, so think of the other principles first. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1617990690730053632))
	- Don't learn what you will forget.
	  
	  If you notice that your hard-learned knowledge is slipping away, invest in the 7th ultralearning principle: retention.
	  
	  Creating flashcards or even personal frameworks makes it much more likely you'll apply the knowledge in different life areas. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1617990693389225984))
	- To become an expert, feed your intuition.
	  
	  Stuffing your (second) brain with facts will not help you gain deep knowledge.
	  
	  The goal of ultralearning is to get to a point where you can make sense of new information using your intuition.
	  
	  All these principles train your intuition. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1617990695998083072))
	- Experiment with everything that you learn.
	  
	  Everybody's learning needs differ, and your challenges are different from mine.
	  
	  So find what goals, tools, approaches, and resources work best for you.
	  
	  Experimentation is the mark of the true ultralearner. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1617990698598563840))
	- Learn about learning with me!
	  
	  For the next 9 days, I'll dig into each of the ultralearning principles and how I've successfully applied them to dozens of intense, self-directed learning projects.
