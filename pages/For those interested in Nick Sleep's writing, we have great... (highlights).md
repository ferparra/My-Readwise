		- **Note**: Nick Sleep has recently published a new letter about short-term vs long-term thinking. He argues that customer obsession is key for long-term business success, and that there is always a trade-off between the two. He also believes that Buffett has an edge in this area, and that confidence, trust, and patience is lacking in many business, charity, and political ecosystems. He provides a list of short-term vs long-term characteristics as a tool to spot and avoid "short-term folly". The original PDF can be found on IGY Foundation's website.
