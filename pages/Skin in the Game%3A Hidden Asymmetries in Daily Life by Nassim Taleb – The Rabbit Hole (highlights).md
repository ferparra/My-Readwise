- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- It is about symmetry, more like having a share of the harm, paying a penalty if something goes wrong.
	- definition, what works cannot be irrational; about every single person I know who has chronically failed in business shares that mental block, the failure to realize that if something stupid works (and makes money), it cannot be stupid.
	- interventionistas don’t learn because they are not the victims of their mistakes
	- You will never fully convince someone that he is wrong; only reality can.
	- No muscles without [[strength]], [[friendship]] without [[trust]], opinion without consequence, change without aesthetics, age without values, life without effort, water without thirst, food without nourishment, love without sacrifice, power without fairness, facts without rigor, statistics without logic, mathematics without proof, teaching without experience, politeness without warmth, values without embodiment, degrees without erudition, militarism without fortitude, progress without civilization, friendship without investment, virtue without risk, probability without [[ergodicity]], [[wealth]] without exposure, complication without depth, fluency without content, decision without asymmetry, [[science]] without [[skepticism]], [[religion]] without [[tolerance]], and, most of all: nothing without [[skin in the game]].
	- we know what is wrong with more clarity than what is right, and that knowledge grows by subtraction
	- Just as individuals should treat others the way they would like to be treated (or avoid being mistreated), families as units should treat other families in the same way.
	- Immanuel Kant’s categorical imperative, which I summarize as: Behave as if your action can be generalized to the behavior of everyone in all places, under all conditions.
	- artisans do things for existential reasons first, financial and commercial ones later. Their decision making is never fully financial, but it remains financial.
	- “What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow: this is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation; go and learn.” Rabbi Hillel the Elder drawing on Leviticus 19:18.
	- Avoid taking advice from someone who gives advice for a living, unless there is a penalty for their advice.
	- when you are rewarded for perception, not results, you need to show sophistication.
	- what plagues [[socialism]]: people’s individual interests do not quite work well under [[collectivism]].
	- brothers Geoff and Vince Graham summarizes the ludicrousness of scale-free political universalism. I am, at the Fed level, libertarian; at the state level, Republican; at the local level, Democrat; and at the family and friends level, a socialist.
	- The underlying structure of reality matters much more than the participants,
	- Volatile things are not necessarily risky, and the reverse is also true. Jumping from a bench would be good for you and your bones, while falling from the twenty-second floor will never be so.
	- What matters isn’t what a person has or doesn’t have; it is what he or she is afraid of losing. The more you have to lose, the more fragile you are.
	- Statistics isn’t about data but distillation, rigor, and avoiding being fooled by randomness
	- Things that have survived are hinting to us ex post that they have some robustness—conditional on their being exposed to harm.
	- Survival comes first, truth, understanding, and science later.
	- you will not have an idea about what people really think, what predicts people’s actions, merely by asking them—they themselves don’t necessarily know. What matters, in the end, is what they pay for goods, not what they say they “think” about them, or the various possible reasons they give you or themselves for that
	- religion exists to enforce tail risk management across generations, as its binary and unconditional rules are easy to teach and enforce
	- Risk and ruin are different tings. In a strategy that entails ruin, benefits never offset risks of ruin.
	- Ergodicity holds when a collection of players have the same statistical properties (particularly expectation) as a single player over time. Ensemble probabilities are similar to time probabilities. Absence of ergodicity makes the risk properties not directly transferable from observed probability to the payoff of a strategy subjected to ruin (or any absorbing barrier or “uncle point”)
	- The fat tails argument: The more a system is capable of delivering large deviations, the worse under the axiom of sustainability
	- If the investor has to eventually reduce his exposure because of losses, or because of retirement, or because he got divorced to marry his neighbor’s wife, or because he suddenly developed a heroin addiction after his hospitalization for appendicitis, or because he changed his mind about life, his returns will be divorced from those of the market, period
	- “in order to succeed, you must first survive.” My own has been: “never cross a river if it is on average four feet deep.” I effectively organized all my life around the point that sequence matters and the presence of ruin disqualifies cost-benefit analyses
	- A situation is deemed non-ergodic when observed past probabilities do not apply to future processes. There is a “stop” somewhere, an absorbing barrier that prevents people with [[skin in the game]] from emerging from it—and to which the system will invariably tend.
	- If you incur a tiny probability of ruin as a “one-off” risk, survive it, then do it again (another “one-off” deal), you will eventually go bust with a probability of one hundred percent.
	- Rationality is avoidance of systemic ruin.
	- just like Antaeus, you cannot separate knowledge from contact with the ground.
	- The abrasions of your skin guide your learning and discovery, a mechanism of organic signaling, what the Greeks called pathemata mathemata (“guide your learning through pain,” something mothers of young children know rather well).
	- Never compare a multiplicative, systemic, and fat-tailed risk to a non-multiplicative, idiosyncratic, and thin-tailed one.
	- ven economics is based on the notion of “revealed preferences.” What people “think” is not relevant—you want to avoid entering the mushy-soft and self-looping discipline of psychology. People’s “explanations” for what they do are just words, stories they tell themselves, not the business of proper science. What they do, on the other hand, is tangible and measurable and that’s what we should focus on.
