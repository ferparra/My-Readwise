	- I am the one get­ting stupi­der, or was stupid all along, and so I don’t have the cog­ni­tive strength to ac­cu­rately judge the stu­pidity level around me, and just hap­pen to be think­ing it is get­ting worse be­cause I don’t know any bet­ter. (Dun­ning-Kruger effect)
	- Peo­ple or­di­nar­ily use differ­ent modes of think­ing in differ­ent com­mu­ni­ca­tions con­texts. In some, find­ing the truth is im­por­tant and so they use ra­tio­nal in­tel­li­gence. In oth­ers, dec­o­ra­tive dis­play, rit­ual, as­sert­ing dom­i­nance or sub­mis­sion, dis­play­ing tribal alle­giances, etc. are more im­por­tant and so they use modes more ap­pro­pri­ate to those things
	- I am ac­quiring greater wis­dom with age as I ought, but the av­er­age age of the typ­i­cal per­son I en­counter stays the same so they can­not keep up. I’m notic­ing the con­trast in­creas­ing but mis­at­tribut­ing it. (David Wood­er­son effect)

	- Stupid choices used to re­li­ably have un­de­sir­able re­sults; now there is more of a dis­con­nect where peo­ple are shielded from the re­sults of their stupid choices, or even re­warded for them (man lights him­self on fire in an eas­ily-forsee­able mis­ad­ven­ture, be­comes YouTube leg­end)
