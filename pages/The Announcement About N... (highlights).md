	- The announcement about net energy gain in a fusion reaction is important because fusion has the potential for infinite, cheap energy. But why?
	  
	  It's encapsulated by graph 1, which contains the secrets of the universe:

	- It shows all the elements:
	  
	  Lighter on the left (eg H for hydrogen) to heaviest on the right (eg U for Uranium)
	  
	  Highest energy at the bottom (H), to more stable at the top (Fe)

	- Fission reactions (normal "nuclear") transform Uranium into smaller particles, and generates each time the energy equivalent to the red arrow on the right.

	- Fusion, meanwhile, takes elements like H or Helium and converts them into heavier elements following the red arrow on the left. Much more energy!

	- Not only that, but H also accounts for nearly 75% of all atoms in the universe, and He (Helium) is most of the rest, so this fuel is infinite

	- This curve also explains many other things. Eg:
	  
	  Why does the Earth have a magnetic field? 
	  
	  Because its core is made of Iron-Nickel, and these elements are magnetic.
	  
	  Why is the core made of Fe-Ni? Because these are very common as the most stable elements

	- You can see in the previous graph (abundance of materials, logarithmic) that Fe and Ni are overrepresented. That's because, as the most stable elements, fusion and fission reactions tend to produce them, but they don't tend to get transmuted into something else.

	- This graph explains many more things:
	- I wrote an article going into the detail of these things here. Should I write more about this?
