	- No.
	  
	  A Fed pivot is not the only condition required for stocks to moon again.
	  
	  2001 teaches us why.
	  
	  A short thread.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- The Macro Compass framework calls for a period of slowing real growth, possibly peaking inflationary pressures but still a tight monetary policy stance ahead.
	  
	  When looking for historical parallels though, controlling for the above variables isnâ€™t enough.

	- We also need to think about a period when:
	- In my opinion early 2001 serves as a very compelling historical parallel, because:
	  
	  A) Leading to this period, the Dot-Com bubble had generated excessive risk taking in markets (exactly like in 2021: ARKK, Bitcoin, etc.);

	- B) CPI had rapidly increased from sub-2% in mid-1999 to 3.8% in Q1-2000, and inflation remained close to 4% for many months to come (as today, stubbornly above the Fed's target);
	  
	  C) As a result, the Fed had to hike rates by 200 bps in a few quarters (deja vu?)...

	- ...and the hurdle to cut rates was very high - a similar setup to today
	  
	  Leading macro indicators showed signs of stress in 2000, and by the end of the year the labor market was weakening and EPS growth was flatlining (again - similar to today)
	  
	  So, what happened in 2001?
	  
	  6/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1612138213132451841))
	- The Fed cut rates by 475 bps (!)
	- Well, in 2001 despite a massive Fed pivot here is the performance of these asset classes (prices, not total return):
	- What the heck?!
	  
	  Period of sharp EPS contraction (2001, 2008) generally bring the SPX down too.
	  
	  Earnings and multiples rarely bottom at the same time, and as the Fed was easing hard in late 2001 multiples started to stabilize - but as EPS are dropping like a stone...

	- ...and you are effectively in a corporate and labor market recession it's not easy for risk sentiment to pick up.
	  
	  A post bear-market bull run needs earnings to be close to bottoming and an easier Fed to be well, well under way for long already.
	  
	  In short...

	- ...Fed pivot = stonks to the moon immediately is not necessarily a sound equation.
	  
	  Yes, a Fed pivot might release a short-term bear market squeeze like the many we have seen in 2022.
	  
	  But for a secular bull run, that's not the only necessary condition.
	  
	  Finally...
