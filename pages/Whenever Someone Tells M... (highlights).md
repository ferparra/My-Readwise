	- Whenever someone tells me they want to learn to cook (or get better at cooking), this is the first book I recommend. 
	  
	  Salt Fat Acid Heat by Samin Nosrat— a masterclass on home cooking. 
	  
	  I highly recommend checking it out. Here’s what you’ll learn.

	- Samin starts with deep dives into what she classifies as the 4 major elements of cooking— Salt, Fat, Acid, and Heat. 
	  
	  Think of this as a masterclass in the high-level concepts of cooking.

	- These sections are incredibly detailed, with amazing illustrations and diagrams to go along with them. 
	  
	  Her approach touches on both the science of cooking, as well as the philosophy and theory behind it.

	- You’ll learn the HOW and the WHY behind these concepts.

	- The book also includes tons of practical advice.
	- Finally, it includes a ton of recipes. 
	  
	  Samin cooked at Chez Panise and can hang with the best of them. Her recipes are approachable, reliable, and delicious. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/myles_cooks/status/1625279579551068160))
	- What I love most though is that her recipes are designed not just to help you master one dish, but rather to learn concepts and techniques that transcend dishes. 
	  
	  Her recipes are packed with additional tidbits like this:
