	- A Breakdown of the Hedge Fund Industry
	  
	  "Ok stupid question, what *is* a hedge fund?"
	  
	  I get this question all the time.
	  It's NOT a stupid question.
	  
	  The hedge fund industry is so damn secretive & every primer out on the internet sucks.
	  
	  Here's a comprehensive breakdown.
	  👇

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ Style:
	  
	  Systematic -
	  These funds hire quants & build algos where each strategy/trade "sweeps" across an entire market for hard-to-spot arbitrage.
	  
	  example: "dispersion trade" i.e. buy options on all single stocks in SPX, sell an equivalent sum of options on SPX the index ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1563577186535108610))
	- Discretionary -
	  These funds take a view on specific companies & do "fundamental research" (read about the business, track metrics, talk to executives) before manually placing positions.
	  
	  example: buy $CMG after an E.coli outbreak cuz diseases are temporary & the stock is oversold ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1563577187688583168))
	- 2/ Asset Class:
	  
	  FICC -
	  stands for Fixed Income + Commodities + Currencies
	  
	  Generally FI vs CC vs equities are mutually exclusive (hedge funds only do 1 of 3) unless we're talking about giants like Citadel who do all.
	  My guess is 30% of funds do FI, 10% CC, and 60% do equities. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1563577188716204032))
	- 3/ Market Exposure:
	  
	  Market neutral -
	  roughly equal volumes and leverage in longs vs shorts (i.e. beta hedged) such that a portfolio holds no directional risk if the entire market rockets or crashes
	  
	  example: Bridgewater's "All Weather" risk-parity fund

	- Not market neutral -
	- 4/ Level of Diversification & "Involvement"
	  
	  Activist -
	  contrary to popular belief, activists don't acquire the whole company (that's PE); usually just 5-10% (must file a public 13D report)
	  e.g. Icahn, Ackman
	  
	  Passive -
	  all positions stay under 5% of the market cap of a company ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1563577191824101381))
	- 5/ Management Structure
	  
	  Single manager -
	  a top dog (the eponymous hero) calls the shots & everyone else is an NPC 💀 -- jkjk
	  e.g. Paulson
	  
	  "Pod shop" -
	  many PMs all run completely separate books; if one is long & another short, positions may/ may not net at firm level
	  e.g. P72 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1563577192818155522))
