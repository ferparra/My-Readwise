	- Now let me explain the link between energy, entropy and temperature!
	  
	  If a probability distribution p maximizes its entropy S subject only to a constraint on ⟨E⟩, the expected value of its energy, the maximum occurs at a point p where
	  
	  d⟨E⟩ = TdS

	- But in fact this formula works for any quantity A, not just energy.   And it's clearest if we ignore T and focus on the Lagrange multiplier β.   
	  
	  β also determines the probability distribution where the maximum occurs!    The combination of these two formulas is powerful.

	- The equations here are general mathematical facts, not 'laws of physics' that could be disproved using experiments.  They're useful in many contexts, depending on what quantity A we're studying.
	  
	  They also  generalize to situations where we have more than one constraint.

	- Some math:
	  
	  The picture here lives in the space of all probability distributions p.   I'm drawing dS as a vector at right angles to a level surface of ⟨E⟩.  Really I should draw it as a stack of planes tangent to this level surface!   dS is a 1-form, the vector is ∇S.

	- How do we get the formula for pᵢ in terms of β, called the Gibbs distribution?   It's an important calculation, so click on this link to see it.   At one step they say "apply the first law of thermodynamics".   That's a wee bit misleading.

	- We can do the whole calculation using just math: the Lagrange multiplier they call -λ₂ is what I'm calling β.  The "first law of thermodynamics" is only used to rename this quantity 1/kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant.

	- I prefer to maximize entropy with a constraint on the expected value of an arbitrary quantity A, and then argue that when A is energy, the Lagrange multiplier β deserves to be called 'coolness'.    
	  
	  I did that here:
