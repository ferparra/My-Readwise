	- Using Obsidian for creative work is amazing.
	  
	  I write my weekly newsletter in Obsidian. Every week, I write about new, interesting topics, concepts, or frameworks. I also send out the best of what I've found: quotes, tools, you name it.
	  
	  Here's how I keep track of it all. üëá

	- In the image above, you can see what I wrote about each week.
	  
	  This helps me keep an overview of the themes I write about.
	  Do I continue the trend? Or do I write about something else entirely?
	  
	  I make the view using the Dataview query below + the Minimal theme cards feature.

	- In each newsletter note, I have a heading under which I capture anything I can use in that edition.
	  
	  I use my plugin, QuickAdd, to send links and thoughts to the note-without even opening it.
	  
	  Then I can stay in flow, but still capture cool stuff I want in the newsletter. https://t.co/aVHgMYxocl ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrisbbh/status/1494407100545576971))
	- How do I ensure I never miss something I've added to my vault that could be a great addition?
	  
	  In every newsletter note, I keep an automatically-updated list of notes I've created in the last 7 days.
	  
	  This is how you can make it with Dataview üëá
