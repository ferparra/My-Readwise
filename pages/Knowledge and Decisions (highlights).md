document_note:: In Knowledge and Decisions, Thomas Sowell argues that knowledge is man's most severe restraint in decision-making, and that understanding incentives, constraints, feedback mechanisms, and who the decision-maker is can help make decisions easier. He further discusses the evolution of decision-making processes and the importance of considering not only the amount of knowledge but also its quality. Additionally, Sowell emphasizes the importance of understanding the costs associated with decision-making, and how incentives can affect the type of people drawn to decision-making roles.
