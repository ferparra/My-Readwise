	- Andy Rachleff (@arachleff) coined P/M-fit.  I’ve been listening to his thoughts on the idea, and a few points that stand out that don’t get mentioned enough 🧵: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattwensing/status/1391730347382083585))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 💡 Andy credits Don Valentine (Sequoia) with inspiring the concept; Don said he was looking for a product so good that a startup could screw up everything else (which they inevitably would) and still win. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattwensing/status/1391730348950761472))
	- So while it’s both possible and common to build a good software business without product/market-fit ...
	  
	  It’s also very hard to fail to build a great business if you have it.
	  
	  That makes it worth the pursuit. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattwensing/status/1391730350485815297))
	- 📈 Andy says you know you have it in consumer (and I would add freemium B2B) when you see exponential organic growth. 
	  
	  This comes from customers being so delighted they tell their friends and it spreads through word of mouth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattwensing/status/1391730351345647618))
	- This is a really clear definition compared to how it’s often used. 
	  
	  I think we lower the bar because it’s so rare to see this kind of growth, but in doing so we water down the idea. 
	  
	  (Again, it’s possible to build a good business without it.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattwensing/status/1391730352817950722))
	- 🧪 Other tests: high NPS, customers scream if it’s taken away, or a sales yield (sales team earnings / sales team cost) > 1.
	  
	  The “customers scream” test maps cleanly to @SeanEllis’s “How would you feel if you no longer had it ... ?” survey. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattwensing/status/1391730353509998592))
	- Prior to getting into market, a good sign is prospects demanding to know when they can (finally) have the thing, or tell you they’ve already spent money on trying to solve (but failed). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattwensing/status/1391730354243911681))
	- 🚧 The early-stage risk is the thing you ship doesn’t match what this segment wants.
	  
	  In that case, Andy recommends changing The Who—not The What (of your value hypothesis, cf @ericries & @sgblank).
	  
	  In other words, hold the core product constant, change the market(ing). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattwensing/status/1391730355019919362))
	- Why change the who and not the what?  Because adding features to appease a market segment leads to consensus outcomes (by definition).
	  
	  Not trying to add features to find P/M-fit aligns with my hourglass roadmap theory: https://t.co/a6QEUByMkr ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattwensing/status/1391730355812569091))
