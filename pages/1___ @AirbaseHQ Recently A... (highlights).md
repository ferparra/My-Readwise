	- 1/ @AirbaseHQ recently announced our Series B of $60M led by @MenloVentures. Here is the investment memo that helped us do it in 10 days.
	  
	  (A thread on why I choose to write long-form memos instead of relying on pitch decks.)

	- 2/ My previous company was venture funded too, but raising money for it was a massive slog. Most of the miles on my beat-up 1998 Honda Accord were on Sand Hill Road ðŸ˜‚ 
	  
	  I exchanged many brain cells for lessons on what it takes to raise money from high-quality investors. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejo/status/1415008309287940096))
	- 3/ There is lots of very specific advice out there about how pitch decks should be structured. But, Iâ€™ve learned that telling a good story about your startup is so important that you should pick whatever approach suits your business and unique strengths as a founder.

	- 4/ I've found that my thinking is more structured when I write down my thoughts and I best communicate complex ideas that way. So, I gravitate towards writing memos instead of making decks. Bottom-line, it's important to play to your strengths. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejo/status/1415008311011803136))
	- 5/ It's really hard to communicate nuance in the standard pitch deck. It's even harder when you're trying to walk people through it and your narrative is constantly getting derailed by questions and tangential discussions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejo/status/1415008311804502021))
	- 6/ Are you afraid investors won't read a memo? If a potential investor can't spend the time to read a 10-page memo before making the decision to invest millions of dollars in your company, do you want to work with them? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejo/status/1415008312639168516))
	- 7/ Sharing a memo very early in the process meant I did not have to spend a huge amount of time explaining the nuances of our business, like the product principles we value, strategy, and competitive differentiation, to every investor. It was all covered in the memo. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejo/status/1415008313494806536))
	- 8/ With a memo, you get to share your story on your terms. Doing that is much harder when youâ€™re trying to walk a group of people through a set of slides. If investors come to a subsequent meeting having read the memo, you can have a much more substantive conversation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejo/status/1415008314358861824))
	- 9/ Any VC firm that wants to give you a term sheet has to write an investment memo internally as part of their process of convincing all the stakeholders. Youâ€™re doing a lot of their work by writing a memo and likely ensuring that your story is being told the way you want. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejo/status/1415008315206082563))
	- 10/ Communicating differentiation is especially important in our category where the dominant narrative has been about corporate cards and we've consistently been evangelizing spend management as the category and bigger prize. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejo/status/1415008316036575236))
	- 11/ It's especially important to communicate strategy and differentiation clearly when there are other companies in the space that have raised and are burning huge amounts of money. That scares investors. It takes clarity of thought to break through the noise. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejo/status/1415008316950908929))
	- 12/ Back to the top if you want to read the actual memo that helped @Airbase raise $60M in 10 days.
