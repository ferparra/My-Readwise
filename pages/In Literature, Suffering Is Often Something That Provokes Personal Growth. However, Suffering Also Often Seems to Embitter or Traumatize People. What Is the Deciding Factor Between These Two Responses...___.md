- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Jan 26th, 2023]]
	- People can be traumatized and also move towards personal growth. People can grow personally and still remain traumatized (and bitter) -- to some degree. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnt4yvjadfyxtahp76vkbsv))
	- Also, rather than thinking that "either" people engage in personal growth "or" people remain stuck in bitterness and trauma, think of it more as "both / and." Here, the notion of polarities (similar to a continuum) has been helpful for me. (For more, see Barry Johnson's book, *Polarity Management.)* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnt6xsnq7jk2c6b3gzy367y))
	- One part of personal growth involves our ability to incorporate the 'negative' (bitterness & trauma) as well as the 'positive' (growth) into our perspective. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnt7bd3bm6mdjvx1bvgcrdb))
	- For many people entering into therapy, traumatic events / life situations are often provide the impetus for someone to begin growing as a person. (See: Freud and / or Jung here. Or several of the excellent current books on trauma, including *The Body Keeps the Score* and *Waking the Tiger: Healing Trauma*.)

	- if I break my arm, I will need to heal. Healing an arm is like personal growth in psychology. Even after the arm is healed, it is still 'traumatized'. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqntakvadhwahw2fp8eqg5yn))
	- "Kegan’s Stages of Adult Development
	  
	  •   Stage 1 — Impulsive mind (early childhood)
	    
	  •   Stage 2 — Imperial mind (adolescence, 6% of adult population)
	    
	  •   Stage 3 — Socialized mind (58% of the adult population)
	    
	  •   Stage 4 — Self-Authoring mind (35% of the adult population)
	    
	  •   Stage 5 — Self-Transforming mind (1% of the adult population)" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqntckkznz1pxkqfy2qc29yy))
	- what is it to suffer (which experiences count as deeply *bad*)? And what would it look like to be positively transformed by suffering (what sorts of outcomes of suffering are *good* outcomes)? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqntedzvwpdyd7dd14y2pz89))
	- For Nietzsche, suffering is an opportunity to reflect and destroy what someone’s values are. That is, through suffering you are able to see the world differently and to then derive new values about the world from your suffering. What was once considered to be important to you is now seen as base or no longer worth valuing due to this new experience of suffering.
