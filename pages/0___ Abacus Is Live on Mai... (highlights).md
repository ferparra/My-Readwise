	- 0/ Abacus is live on main net!
	  
	  Today your apps can share state across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB and Celo, enabling interchain composability with Abacus.
	  
	  We’ve launched what we’re calling Mainnet Alpha, read on to learn all about it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Abacus_Network/status/1547982014766190593))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ So what is Mainnet Alpha? It's phase 1 for Abacus and Interchain apps
	  
	  This sets a foundation for future releases and the growth of the Abacus Network. Despite being an ‘alpha’ release, it enables Abacus' core value prop; interchain messaging and interchain applications. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Abacus_Network/status/1547982016234131457))
	- 2/ Future releases will improve the functionality and bolster the security of the network.
	  
	  The most notable upcoming additions will be PoS on every supported network for general security, and Sovereign Consensus, for app specific security. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Abacus_Network/status/1547982017685377030))
	- 3/ You can now use Abacus to send messages between blockchains. 
	  
	  Even better, you can use Abacus to build an interchain application.

	- 4/ Abacus is not a bridge. Abacus is a network between blockchains. 
	  
	  Bridges are out. Interchain apps are in. 
	  
	  Bridges put the onus of interoperability on a user, each bridge fragmenting experience. 
	  
	  Interchain apps bring it to the app, unifying the experience across chains. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Abacus_Network/status/1547982022039465984))
	- 5/ A network between blockchains enables interchain applications.
	  
	  Interchain apps seek the right blockspace.
	  
	  Abacus will become the router for blockspace, matching applications and users based on their preferences of cost, security, latency, you name it! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Abacus_Network/status/1547982023360360452))
	- 6/ What does it even mean to be an interchain app? An interchain app can take orders on one chain and execute on another, allowing a user to interact with it from any chain.  
	  
	  Borrow on Polygon with collateral on Eth. 
	  
	  Trade a perp on BNB with margin held on Arbitrum. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Abacus_Network/status/1547982024853450753))
	- 7/ Interchain apps mean you're no longer constrained to the userbase of your first chain. 
	  
	  You're no longer dependent on the survival and success of your first chain.
	  
	  What would you build if you weren't constrained by any chain? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Abacus_Network/status/1547982026287894529))
	- 8/ If you want to dive in head first, and get started on your interchain app check out our docs and join our discord, we'd love to hear from you
