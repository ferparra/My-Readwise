	- ‚Äú**A goal stood before Siddhartha, a single goal: to become empty**, empty of thirst, empty of wishing, empty of dreams, empty of joy and sorrow. Dead to himself, not to be a self any more, to find tranquility with an emptied heard, to be open to miracles in unselfish thoughts, that was his goal. Once all of my self was overcome and had died, once every desire and every urge was silent in the heart, then the ultimate part of me had to awake, the innermost of my being, which is no longer my self, the great secret.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs50fcd0731szyak45dcbtzq))

	- **‚ÄúIt is good,‚Äù he thought, ‚Äúto get a taste of everything for oneself, which one needs to know. That lust for the world and riches do not belong to the good things**, I have already learned as a child. I have known it for a long time, but I have experienced only now. And now I know it, don‚Äôt just know it in my memory, but in my eyes, in my heart, in my stomach. Good for me, to know this!‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs50h864x6yq7b9gwat2p5b8))

	- Very good quote from [[Siddhartha]] when he starts questioning everything ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe ablutions were good, but they were water, they did not wash off the sin, they did not heal the spirit‚Äôs thirst, they did not relieve the fear in his heart. The sacrifices and the invocation of the gods were excellent‚Äî but was that all? Did the sacrifices give a happy fortune? And what about the gods? Was it really [Prajapati](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajapati) who had created the world? Was it not the [Atman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism)), He, the only one, the singular one? Were the gods not creations, created like me and you, subject to time, mortal? Was it therefore good, was it right, was it meaningful and the highest occupation to make offerings to the gods? For whom else were offerings to be made, who else was to be worshiped but Him, the only one, the Atman? **And where was Atman to be found, where did He reside, where did his eternal heart beat, where else but in one‚Äôs own self, in its innermost part, in its indestructible part, which everyone had in himself? But where, where was this self, this innermost part, this ultimate part? It was not flesh and bone, it was neither thought nor consciousness, thus the wisest ones taught. So, where, where was it?** To reach this place, the self, myself, the Atman, there was another way, which was worthwhile looking for? Alas, and nobody showed this way, nobody knew it, not the father, and not the teachers and wise men, not the holy sacrificial songs! They knew everything , the Brahmans and their holy books, they knew everything, they had taken care of everything and of more than everything, the creation of the world, the origin of speech, of food , of inhaling , of exhaling, the arrangement of the senses, the acts of the gods, they knew infinitely much‚Äî but was it valuable to know all of this, not knowing that one and only thing, the most important thing, the solely important thing?‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs50jte8wjtq33npk65v8n7j))
		- **Note**: Siddhartha was wondering if the sacrifices and offerings he was making were enough, and if Prajapati had really created the world. He wanted to know where Atman, the only one, resided, and how to reach it. He asked the wise men and Brahmans, but even though they knew a lot, they did not know the most important thing - where Atman was. Siddhartha was looking for a way to find it, but nobody knew it.
	- With the Samanas
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   Siddhartha was accepted by the Samanas and gave away everything and fasted for weeks at a time. He became dismayed and life was torture
	  ‚Ä¢   Siddhartha questions his decisions and thinks he could have learned the same lessons (how to escape oneself) in normal life
	  ‚Ä¢   ‚ÄúThere is indeed no such thing, so I believe, as what we refer to as `learning‚Äô. There is, oh my friend, just one knowledge, this is everywhere, this is Atman, this is within me and within you and within every creature. And so I‚Äôm starting to believe that this knowledge has no worser enemy than the desire to know it, than learning.‚Äù
	  ‚Ä¢   They hear rumors of a Gotama Buddha, and leave the Samanas to hear the Buddha speak ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs513cmegcen44x90m8mdr4a))
		- **Note**: Siddhartha was accepted by the Samanas, a group of people who practice a simple, spiritual lifestyle. He gave away all his belongings and fasted for weeks. He felt discouraged and life seemed hard. He wondered if he could have learned the same lessons in a different way. He thought that knowledge is everywhere and that the desire to learn can be a bad thing. He heard stories about a wise man named Gotama Buddha, so he left the Samanas to meet him.
	- Gotama
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   Siddhartha could spot the Buddha immediately by his inner peace, lack of imitation, smiling inwardly
	  ‚Ä¢   The Buddha spoke of life as being suffering, how to stop suffering through the [4 Noble Truths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths) and the [Noble Eight-fold Path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path)
	  ‚Ä¢   Govinda decides to join the Buddha‚Äôs community but Siddhartha does not
	  ‚Ä¢   Siddhartha speaks to Gotama and says that his teachings are perfect but there is an error in it, there is a chink in the never ending cycle. Gotama does not disagree but says that his teachings are not an opinion, simply as things are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs511v1t25kszc5b0fwbs516))
		- **Note**: Siddhartha could tell the Buddha was special because he was very peaceful and happy inside. The Buddha taught that life can be hard, but he also showed how to stop the suffering by following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eight-fold Path. Govinda wanted to join the Buddha‚Äôs group, but Siddhartha chose not to. Siddhartha told the Buddha that his teachings were perfect, but he thought there was a mistake in them. The Buddha said his teachings were not his opinion, but just how things were.
	- Awakening
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   After speaking to Gotama, Siddhartha lost the desire to have teachers and to learn
	  ‚Ä¢   ‚Äú**That I know nothing about myself, that Siddhartha has remained thus alien and unknown to me, stems from one cause, a single cause: I was afraid of myself, I was fleeing from myself**!‚Äù
	  ‚Ä¢   He awakens from this realization and starts down a new path of enlightenment ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs510nkn5v5wgag6697rmmcy))
		- **Note**: After Siddhartha spoke to Gotama, he no longer wanted someone to teach him. He realized that he was afraid of himself and was trying to run away from who he was. This made him realize something important and he decided to follow a path that would lead him to enlightenment.
	- Kamala
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   Siddhartha meets Kamala who promises to teach him about love if he can become rich. He gives up his Samana ways and goes to work with a merchant
	  ‚Ä¢   **He claims he has 3 skills ‚Äì he can wait, fast and think.** And while these do not seem like great skills, they preclude Siddhartha from becoming impatient and making irrational decisions, he can wait to eat longer than others and can think through difficult situations or problems ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs50z4zacmftaje52gak0zrr))
		- **Note**: Siddhartha meets a woman named Kamala, who tells him that if he becomes wealthy, she will teach him about love. To do this, he stops being a Samana and finds a job with a merchant. He claims he has three special abilities: he can wait, fast, and think. Even though these skills don't seem important, they help him resist becoming too impatient and making bad choices. He can wait longer than other people to eat, and he can think carefully about difficult situations.
	- With the Childlike People
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   Works with a merchant called Kawaswami to earn money and to have a place to live
	  ‚Ä¢   Siddhartha does not care if he loses or makes money with the merchant ‚Äì and of course this helps him make money
	  ‚Ä¢   He goes to a village to buy rice that has already been sold and instead of getting mad and turning back he makes friends with the villagers and enjoys his stay. Kawaswami gets mad but they have different priorities, priorities which will help Siddhartha in the end
	  ‚Ä¢   ‚ÄúHe saw mankind going through life in a childlike or animal-like manner, which he loved and also despised at the same time. He saw them toiling, saw them suffering, and becoming gray for the sake of things which seemed to him to entirely unworthy of this price, for money, for little pleasures, for being slightly honored, he saw them scolding and insulting each other, he saw them complaining about pain at which a Samana would only smile, and suffering because of deprivations which a Samana would not feel.‚Äù
	  ‚Ä¢   Practiced the art of love with Kamala ‚Äì the art of giving and taking simultaneously
	  ‚Ä¢   ‚ÄúMost people, Kamala, are like a falling leaf, which is blown and is turning around through the air, and wavers, and tumbles to the ground. But others, a few, are like stars, they go on a fixed course, no wind reaches them, in themselves they have their law and their course.‚Äù
	  ‚Ä¢   **‚Äú‚Ä¶yet you do not love me, you love nobody. Isn‚Äôt it so?**‚Äù ‚ÄúIt might very well be so,‚Äù Siddhartha said tiredly. ‚ÄúI am like you. You also do not love‚Äî how else could you practise love as a craft? Perhaps, people of our kind can‚Äôt love. The childlike people can; that‚Äôs their secret.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs50ww7b34wwjsnd1aj6x98m))
		- **Note**: Siddhartha worked with a merchant called Kawaswami to earn money and have a place to live. He didn't mind if he made or lost money. He went to a village to buy rice that had already been sold, but instead of getting mad, he made friends with the villagers and enjoyed his stay. Kawaswami was angry, but Siddhartha and Kawaswami had different goals in mind. Siddhartha saw people living life like children and animals, working hard and becoming old for things that didn't seem worth it, like money and small pleasures. He practiced the art of love with Kamala, which is the art of giving and taking. Kamala asked Siddhartha if he loved anyone, and he said it might be true that people like him can't love, but the childlike people can - and that's their secret.
	- Sansara
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   The more time he spent in the material world, the more he became like normal people, childlike, and the more he began to envy them. The importance they put on their lives and actions, the amount of passion in their fears and joys, of being in love
	  ‚Ä¢   This new life had made Siddhartha tired, old, sick and had quieted his spiritual voice
	  ‚Ä¢   He started gambling and had become petty with his business dealings
	  ‚Ä¢   Siddhartha had a dream and realized he had grown tired of this life and lifestyle. He left everything but the last time he was with Kamala he impregnated her ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs50n4a60dbseq84db7nqzw5))
		- **Note**: Siddhartha spent more and more time in the material world, living like everyone else and he started to envy them. He felt passion in their joys and sorrows, and he fell in love. However, this life made Siddhartha tired, old and sick, and he stopped listening to his inner spiritual voice. He started gambling and was mean in business dealings. He had a dream that made him realize he was tired of this life and he left. Before he left, he and Kamala had a baby together.
	- By the River
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   Tried to drown himself but heard the world ‚ÄúOm‚Äù and realized how foolish his actions were
	  ‚Ä¢   [Om](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om) ‚Äì that what is perfect, or the completion
	  ‚Ä¢   I had to pass through so much stupidity, through so much vices, through so many errors, through so much disgust and disappointments and woe, just to become a child again and to be able to start over.
	  ‚Ä¢   **‚ÄúIt is good,‚Äù he thought, ‚Äúto get a taste of everything for oneself, which one needs to know. That lust for the world and riches do not belong to the good things, I have already learned as a child. I have known it for a long time, but I have experienced only now. And now I know it, don‚Äôt just know it in my memory, but in my eyes, in my heart, in my stomach. Good for me, to know this!‚Äù**
	  ‚Ä¢   Loved the river where he tried to drown himself and decides to stay there a while ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs50q3hy0w13q3kgj4pm9tjr))
		- **Note**: "Siddhartha had tried to drown himself in the river, but he heard the word "Om" and realized how silly his actions were. He had gone through a lot of bad things, but now he finally understood that wanting riches and the world was not a good thing. He knew this in his head, but now he knew it in his eyes, his heart, and his stomach. It was a good thing that he had learned this!"
	- The Ferryman
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   But out of all secrets of the river, he today only saw one, this one touched his soul. He saw that this water ran and ran, incessantly it ran, and was nevertheless always there, was always at all times the same and yet new in every moment
	  ‚Ä¢   Siddhartha asks the Ferryman who drove him over the river years ago to be his new mentor. The Ferryman accepts and they live and work together
	  ‚Ä¢   **‚ÄúNothing was, nothing will be; everything is, everything has existence and is present.‚Äù**
	  ‚Ä¢   People are migrating to go the Gotama because he is dying. Kamala, on her way to the Buddha, gets bitten by a snake and gets taken care of by Siddhartha. He meets his new son ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs50rkfq5sm9h42q22p1bhws))
		- **Note**: Siddhartha noticed that the river was always running, but it was still the same and new at the same time. He asked the Ferryman, who had taken him across the river years ago, to be his teacher. The Ferryman said yes, and they started living and working together. Siddhartha realized that everything exists and is always present. People were going to see the Gotama Buddha because he was dying, and Kamala, who was also going to see him, got bitten by a snake. Siddhartha helped her and also met his new son.
	- The Son
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   Young Siddhartha is used to a different lifestyle but Old Siddhartha does not force anything ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou know that ‚Äòsoft‚Äô is stronger than ‚Äòhard‚Äô, Water stronger than rocks, love stronger than force.
	  ‚Ä¢   The boy took advantage and Siddhartha could not let go
	  ‚Ä¢   The boy eventually ran away and Siddhartha decided that he must go after him
	  ‚Ä¢   He chased after him to the city and after seeing Kamala‚Äôs old garden, he relived his old, pleasure seeking life and felt the disgust but then meditated and Vasudeva came to take him back to their shared hut
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   **Siddhartha finally realized his goal was to be able, at all times, to feel and inhale the oneness. Knowledge of the eternal perfection of the world, smiling, oneness**
	  ‚Ä¢   Siddhartha found Om in the river, the oneness and there he realized he had to stop fighting his fate and stopped suffering
	  ‚Ä¢   Once Siddhartha found this perfection, Vasudeva left into the forests forever ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs50t3eth5005qpf7m8759ae))
		- **Note**: Siddhartha had a son who was used to a different lifestyle, but Siddhartha did not try to make him change. The boy took advantage of him, so he decided he had to go after him. He chased the boy to the city and when he saw Kamala's old garden, he remembered his old life of pleasure-seeking and felt disgusted. Then, he meditated and his friend Vasudeva came to take him back to their shared hut. 
		  
		  Siddhartha realized he wanted to be able to feel and understand the oneness of the world at all times, and to understand the eternal perfection of the world. He found the oneness in the river and he realized he should stop fighting against his fate and stop suffering. Once he found this perfection, Vasudeva left and went into the forests forever.
	- Govinda
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   **‚ÄúWisdom cannot be passed on. Wisdom which a wise man tries to pass on to someone always sounds like foolishness.‚Äù**
	  ‚Ä¢   And this is now a teaching you will laugh about ‚Äì love, oh Govinda, seems to me to be the most important thing of all. To thoroughly understand the world, to explain it, to despise it, may be the thing great thinkers do. **But I‚Äôm only interested in being able to love the world, not to despise it, not to hate it and me, to be able to look upon it and me and all beings with love and admiration and great respect**.‚Äù
	  ‚Ä¢   Govinda experiences oneness when he kisses Siddhartha‚Äôs forehead and then understands.
	  ‚Ä¢   **The perfected ones are always smiling** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs50w30xndktvha4jsk5wwdh))
		- **Note**: Govinda says that a wise person's wisdom can't be passed on because it might sound like foolishness. He also says that instead of trying to explain and understand the world, it is more important to be able to love it and look upon it and all beings with love and respect. When Govinda kissed Siddhartha's forehead, he experienced oneness and understood that the perfected ones are always smiling.
