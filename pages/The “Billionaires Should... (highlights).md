	- The “billionaires shouldn’t exist” discourse reminds me of the change in understanding velocities brought on by Einstein’s relativity. Specifically that velocity addition is not a+b but a relativistic formula that ensures the sum stays below the const max speed (speed of light).

	- It’s probably a silly idea but I do wonder if some sort of non-linear (relativistic?) money have been researched! Sounds like a fun mind experiment. I guess in a way taxes sort of act like that. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1423108247569977349))

	- I see a few replies enthusiastic about billionaires. I think it’s clear that the more you make, the easier it is to stack things in your favor, and it’s a self-reinforcing loop. So I wouldn’t be so confident. The idea of rate-limiting outliers shouldn’t be so controversial. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1423111999685283843))
	- I think the current system seems “natural” in the same way that to many people throughout the history, absolute monarchy might have seemed natural. “Of course that’s how it works.” But maybe someday billionaires will look as outdated as kings?
