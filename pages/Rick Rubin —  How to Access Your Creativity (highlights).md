	- How to Capture Ideas
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Creativity is a process that can be difficult to capture and underst., * Joe Strummer said that if you have an idea, you should write it down and potentially throw it away if you wait too long., * This advice has inspired the speaker to create a system to capture ideas.)

	  Right? And the example that you give that for me really is serving as an anchor. And telling me if I'm wrong here is this idea that ideas and creativity are a little bit like a cloud. If you look at it at one moment, you might think that it looks like one thing, where it has a certain shape and texture. But then you look at it a moment later, it could be quite a bit different. And if you look at it an hour later, it very well could be gone. And the reason I think that serves as such a powerful hook for me to think about creativity and why I think neuroscientists and scientists in general have never actually captured a way to even talk about creativity. It stems from somebody that you knew in person, but as you know, I greatly admire. I don't have many heroes, but I would put Joe Strummer among the short list of heroes that I have. And I remember once an interview with him fairly disjointed, he was sort of, you know, often different tangents that I couldn't follow. But at one point, he just kind of blurted out that if you have an idea, you have to write it down and you may end up throwing it away. But if you wait, it will be gone. And I remember that. And as a consequence, I have a whole system that I used to try and capture ideas. But what are your thoughts on what Joe said?

	- The Importance of Owning Your Feelings as an Artist
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* There is no right or wrong way to be an artist, as there are infinite possibilities., * It is important to be true to oneself and to follow one's own instincts, rather than blindly following the opinions of others., * Being a perfectionist can be a hindrance to one's creativity, as it can lead to selfdoubt.)

	  There's no like in there was a time when if you didn't have a guitar in the studio, you couldn't record guitar or if you didn't, if you couldn't hire an orchestra, there couldn't be orchestra on your recording. Now you can just call any of those things up. So there's infinite choices and infinite choices don't necessarily lead to better, better compositions or better final final works. Understanding how how you feel in the face of other voices without second guessing yourself is probably the single most important thing to practice as an artist or skill set to develop as an artist is to know how you feel and own your feelings. And the key to that is not I know so I know what's right for you. It doesn't work that way. It's just I know for me. And the reason I chose to be an artist is to demonstrate this is how I see it. If I'm if I'm undermining my taste for some commercial idea or it defeats the whole purpose of doing this, this is not that's not what this process is about. This process is I'm doing me and I'm showing you who I am and you can like it or not. But either way, this is still how I see it.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I love that because in science, you know, having trained graduate students, having been a graduate student, I was very blessed to have mentors, one of who was a real iconic class. He's dead now. Actually, all my advisors are dead. Suicide cancer cancer, the joke is you don't want me to work for you. So they were all had a morbid sense of humor. So they're laughing about this someplace right now.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I thought you were going to say they'll eat the poison mushrooms.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So the last one said to me, you're the common denominator, Andrew. And I thought, oh my goodness. And he said, kind of just kidding, but not really. So that's a little bit, Yuri. But in any case, he always said, his name was Ben. He always said, the one thing I can't teach is taste. And the one predictor I have of the people who will never develop it are the ones who are perfectionists, because they're filtering their perfectionists that filter their perfection through the feedback of others. He was always looking for the person that was putting up a little bit of a middle finger to feedback, not so much that they would get things wrong. Because it can be badly wrong in science. You can be wrong for the right reasons, but you can also be wrong for the wrong reasons. But people that just had almost a compulsion to do it their way or to believe in what they were doing. And I'm hearing some of that, or I'm hearing that in what you're describing. ([Time 0:26:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/534b9850-b273-4d60-af99-f90b234c09b6))
	- The truth in comedy is what makes it funny
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* The aperture on a camera lens is changing to present something new to the viewer., * This is done to make the viewer laugh, much like a comedian does.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  Well, it could either be a broadening or a narrowing, but it's changing the aperture from the standard. The reason we do this is to present something new. That maybe you already knew but didn't know you knew it. And for that to be the case, you have to be looking at it's not unlike what a comedian does. You know, comedian makes you laugh. Usually what they're saying, it's outrageous, but you know that it's right, you know, just no one says it that way or no one has said it that way before. But it's always the truth in it that makes it funny. It's like that. ([Time 0:32:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c7a7489f-9b08-4417-9ffb-c2a68cb2bc90))
