	- AI tech is creating entirely new creative workflows.
	  
	  NeRF's are 1 example I'm particularly excited about, & a company called @LumaLabsAI makes capturing them insanely easy.

	- NeRF stands for neural radiance field, and the technology essentially lets you create incredibly realistic 3D scenes by analyzing a bunch of 2D images. https://t.co/NWoymjCERf ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1638617021368893440))
	- In this experiment, I collected a bunch of random things from around my house and used them to create a virtual film set on my coffee table.
	  
	  I used the @LumaLabsAI app to capture the NeRF. They make it as easy as recording a video. https://t.co/d0evA4KZ4e ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1638617146367574016))
	- Two big benefits of NeRFing my scene
	  
	  1) Camera control
	  2) Ability to reshoot my scene infinite times
	  
	  You have full cinematic control in a NeRF. You can adjust the focal length, pitch, roll, yaw, and can shoot (and reshoot) any shot you can imagine as many times as you'd like. https://t.co/tVeHrnkyOn ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1638617231767777280))
	- Once I captured my cinematic clips in my NeRF, I used Midjourney and Runway Gen-1 to style them into something sci-fi themed.
	  
	  Here are some example clips after styling them in Runway Gen-1 https://t.co/lrcOs4Nu4W ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1638617297882591232))
	- These tools and tech open up so many opportunities for creatives, it's mind-boggling.
