	- Do you use Obsidian and miss the card view from Notion?

	- This is all thanks to the Minimal theme by @kepano and the Dataview plugin. Both are absolutely amazing.
	  
	  You can find Minimal in the appearance store in Obsidian, and likewise, you can find the Dataview plugin in the plugin store.
	  
	  Once they're installed, let's move onðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrisbbh/status/1489327909177335818))
	- When you use Dataview, frontmatter matters.
	  
	  Here's what I use for books.
	  On the top, between the '---', you're seeing YAML frontmatter.
	  
	  Under the Metadata heading, you're seeing Dataview fields.
	  
	  With Dataview, they're very similarâ€”but YAML is more hidden away.

	- In your frontmatter, you can put whatever you want.
	  
	  To get the cards view similar to mine, you'll need:
	- Now, let's create the cards view!
	  
	  Put this Dataview query on in a note. It needs to be inside a code block, so just copy this exactly.
	  
	  If you don't use ratings, just delete the line that says ratings.
	  
	  You can also sort by date by adding "SORT file.ctime desc".

	- Okay! Almost there. Now, we enable the cards view for this note.
	  
	  This is done by putting "cards" in your YAML frontmatter, under the cssClasses field. This is mineðŸ‘‡
	  
	  This is what you need to put in your YAML frontmatter: "cssClasses: cards cards-1-1 table-max".
	  
	  And we're done!
