- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Jan 2nd, 2023]]
	- My Summary of Building a [[Second Brain]] by @fortelabs 
	  
	  A guide to developing a [[productivity]] system to manage information and produce [[creative]] works.
	  
	  Enjoyed the book and is a good intro for those new to [[note-taking]]. A good base to build your own system on.

	- My productivity system is inspired by the one in the book:
	- The book is a bit wordy and has a lot of tangents and anecdotes. As someone taking notes for a while, these didn't add much value for me but may be more beneficial to someone entirely new to notetaking
	  
	  Using the techniques from the book to summarize the book was a good exercise. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Bsunter/status/1609727226437861376))
