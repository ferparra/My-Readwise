document_note:: The minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm used in two-player game theory to determine the best move for a player, by minimizing the maximum payoff of the opponent. It assumes that each player is trying to maximize their chances of winning, while the other player is trying to minimize the chances of the first player winning. It is used in zero-sum games to minimize the opponent's maximum payoff, which is the same as minimizing one's own maximum loss and maximizing one's own minimum gain. In non-zero-sum games, it is not generally the same as minimizing the opponent's maximum gain nor the same as the Nash equilibrium strategy. It is also used in combinatorial game theory and repeated games, and is applied to individual decisions in the face of uncertainty.

	- **Minimax** (sometimes **MinMax**, **MM**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#cite_note-1) or **saddle point**[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#cite_note-2)) is a decision rule used in [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), [decision theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory), [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), and [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) for *mini*mizing the possible [loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function) for a [worst case (*max*imum loss) scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worst-case_scenario). When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin" â€“ to maximize the minimum gain. Originally formulated for several-player [zero-sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum) [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision-making in the presence of uncertainty.
