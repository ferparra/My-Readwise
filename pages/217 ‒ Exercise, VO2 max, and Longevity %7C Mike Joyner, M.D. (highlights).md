	- Is it ten % Per Decade?
	  
	  Summary:
	  dave costell, really one of the founders of exrcise physiology in the united states, studied a lot of lead athletes in the sixties and seventies. He brought them back to his lab when these guys in the nineties, 19 nineties, when they were in their late forties and fifties. And about a third of them had continued to train very hard and had minimal reductions in their vo to maxs. So you do have to stay at it.

	  Doctor dave costell, really one of the founders of exrcise physiology in the united states, studied a lot of lead athletes in the sixties and seventies. He brought them back to his lab when these guys in the nineties, 19 nineties, when they were in their late forties and fifties. And about a third of them had continued to train very hard and had minimal reductions in their vo to maxs. A third ho had become sort of joggers, had some reduction. And there was a third that had just stopped doing anything, and they looked like regular, sedentary people. So you do have to stay at it. A group of master athletes out in the alre were studied, same sorts of things. People decline, and their vio two max declined. But among the people who continued to train intensely, in the case the men, do some strength training, their vio two max decline at a much lower rate. So you have a situation where it's ten % if you do nothing, and if you really work at it and stay with it itar really high level, it's, you know, maybe five or six % per decade. But most people who've been super competitive can't quite keep doing that their entire life, so they drop off a little bit. But even if they drop off ten % per decade, they start at a much higher base line. If your base line is 60 verses 35, and you lose ten % per decade, you're still going to be way, way, way ahead. And at age 60 or 70, you're going to have a v o two max value higher than a, you know, 30 year old. ([Time 0:48:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7a754b9b-63e3-47e6-923d-9c694ca40799))
