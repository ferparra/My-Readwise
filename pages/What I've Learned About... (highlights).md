	- Everyone always wants to know:
	  ‚Ä¢ What‚Äôs working right now?
	  ‚Ä¢ What are other companies doing that I‚Äôm not?
	  ‚Ä¢ What‚Äôs working for them?
	  ‚Ä¢ Why are we hitting a plateau?
	  
	  They always wants to know, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the one thing?‚Äù ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727447743025161))
	- Many people see growth as a mysterious concoction of hacks, luck, and a big budget.
	  
	  They'll talk about product/market fit, fundraising, hiring, advertising, and sales teams.
	  
	  But nothing is concrete enough to take action on. Plus, are these things directly connected to growth? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727448791597059))
	- We've all seen or worked at companies that raise a ton of money, build a great product, hire a great team, spend lots of money on ads... or any combination of these... and still not hit their growth goals.
	  
	  Why is this? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727450611978246))
	- The reality is that it's never just one thing that unlocks growth.
	  
	  I think we, as human beings, want it to just be one thing ‚Äî a silver bullet, hack, trick, pivot, you name it.
	  
	  Because that would make it easier.
	  
	  But it‚Äôs not just one thing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727452176457742))
	- It takes a combination of the right factors *working together.*
	  
	  Growth, in my experience, is the result of 5 interdependent factors.
	  
	  Interdependent = they're all reliant on each other; you're only as strong as your weakest link. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727453195669506))
	- Here's my methodology based on everything I've learned.
	  
	  Growth is an interdependent system made up of your:
	  ‚Ä¢ Market
	  ‚Ä¢ Product
	  ‚Ä¢ Model
	  ‚Ä¢ Messaging &amp; Positioning
	  ‚Ä¢ Channels

	- Your growth strategy can be distilled into five questions:
	  ‚Ä¢ Who are your customers?
	  ‚Ä¢ What are they trying to achieve that you can help with?
	  ‚Ä¢ How can you engage, monetize, and retain them?
	  ‚Ä¢ Why are you the best solution?
	  ‚Ä¢ Where can you find and communicate with them? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727460560912384))
	- I'll explain my reasoning for each one. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727461991079937))
	- MARKET
	  
	  Why is "market" the first of the five factors?
	  
	  News flash: the hard part about product/market fit isn't the product, it's the market. (credit to @benjihyam and @deveshkhanal)
	  
	  Everything is dependent on the customer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727463337431043))
	- Here are 3 reasons why the market is a critical factor to growth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727464369250320))
	- 1. "It doesn‚Äôt matter how amazing your product is, or how fast you ship features. The market you‚Äôre in will determine most of your growth. Gumroad grew at roughly the same rate almost every month because that‚Äôs how quickly the market determined we would grow." ‚Äî @shl ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727465308770313))
	- Can you tell when Gumroad let go of 3/4 the team and got some bad publicity in a major publication?
	  
	  Me neither. Because they were growing *with* the market.

	- 2. Customer research
	  
	  What I‚Äôve found is there are two types of companies:
	  
	  (1) Companies that guess
	  (2) Companies that invest in customer research ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727473537990657))
	- In today‚Äôs market, features are mostly undifferentiated, there are more options to choose from than ever, and new startups pop up every day.
	  
	  The only difference between you and the next business is how well you know your customers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727474897035266))
	- The magic of customer research is that you don‚Äôt have to guess.
	  
	  In fact, your customers will tell you everything you need to know.
	  
	  You just need to ask.
	  
	  A lack of customer research can be the cause of many startup woes: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727476016832517))
	- (1) Customers are signing up but they‚Äôre churning out just as fast as they come in.
	  
	  (2) Marketing experiments are expensive, inconclusive, or under-performing.
	  
	  (3) Prospects are expressing a lot of interest but just aren‚Äôt closing into customers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727477023510535))
	- (4) New features and products don‚Äôt seem to be making a difference to revenue growth or product/market fit.
	  
	  Customer research is necessary for every aspect of the business: product, marketing, sales, customer success, growth, operations.
	  
	  Here are a couple ways you can start: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727477979820037))
	- (1) Ask to hop on a video call and just spend 30 minutes with someone to get to know them better
	  
	  (2) Send a survey out to a specific group of people
	  
	  (3) Collect qualitative research from online communities, forums, review sites, and social media platforms ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727479074525184))
	- (4) Get together and share what you're hearing.
	  
	  https://t.co/E0xwHyXZBD https://t.co/6MkTqcwrSF ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727480278237195))
	- 3. Expand to new markets
	  
	  This can take a few different forms:
	  
	  (1) Going upmarket to sell into larger deals
	  
	  (2) Going downmarket to sell into smaller deals
	  
	  (3) Sell into new types of businesses or different industries
	  
	  (4) Internationalization ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727481536532482))
	- Think of markets on a 2x2 chart based on size and growth.
	  
	  Know which market you‚Äôre getting into!
	  
	  It's hard to grow in a small, contracting market. It's easy to grow in a large, growing market. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2zUuvPWEAYGWEB.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727487291166727))
	- PRODUCT
	  
	  Here are a few reasons why your product is one of the factors to growth (including a few you probably didn‚Äôt expect). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727488675291137))
	- 1. "You can't polish a turd" ‚Äî @aprildunford
	  
	  No amount of research, marketing, or clever copywriting can make up for a sh*t product.
	  
	  Great products unlock great growth potential. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727489749078018))
	- "If your product is remarkable, getting noticed is a lot easier." ‚Äî @peldi
	  
	  Having a great product isn't all that's required to grow.
	  
	  Customers aren't going to magically show up out of nowhere (that's the "build it and they will come" fallacy). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727490835390473))
	- But you'll have a much easier time marketing a product that's truly exceptional.
	  
	  Bad products kill marketing. Great products amplify the effectiveness of marketing.
	  
	  But what makes a great product? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727491946795011))
	- One way to think about it is on a matrix of how big the problem is and how frequently it occurs.
	  
	  You want to build a product that solves:
	  ‚Ä¢ Big, frequent problems.
	  ‚Ä¢ Or at least small frequent problems
	  ‚Ä¢ Or big rare problems.
	  ‚Ä¢ But almost never small, rare problems.

	- If we take it one step further for specific features, imagine comparing differentiation and demand:
	  ‚Ä¢ Competitive differentiators
	  ‚Ä¢ Features that are specifically tailored to certain types of customers
	  ‚Ä¢ Features that check the boxes
	  ‚Ä¢ One-off requests / random ideas 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2zUvrUWQAQWtQ7.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727503053307904))
	- These things can also make a difference long-term:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ IP, trademarks, and patents
	  ‚Ä¢ Design
	  ‚Ä¢ Partnerships and integrations
	  ‚Ä¢ Unique functions/data/expertise
	  ‚Ä¢ Being opinionated ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727504731127814))
	- Of course none of this matters if you can't effectively onboard users.
	  
	  The key to effective onboarding is to guide the user through the *minimum* required steps they need to get their first ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment in understanding the potential of the product. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727505913884684))
	- @NirEyal offers a simple habit loop in his book Hooked to start thinking about making your product more habitual.

	- How do you know you've built a great product? I don't think it needs to be over-engineered.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ High retention
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ High NPS
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ High "very disappointed" PMF survey response rate ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727512297644034))
	- This is one of my all-time favorite case studies on turning customer research into building a great product.

	- MODEL
	  
	  I.e. the way you activate a user and charge them for using your product.
	  
	  Pricing can be one of the most overwhelming and puzzling parts of business.
	  
	  And the activation model is often an afterthought. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727514709331973))
	- SaaS businesses, in particular, have a unique challenge with pricing for a few reasons:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ There‚Äôs an almost infinite number of different ways to price a SaaS product. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727516076679172))
	- ‚Ä¢ The cost to produce and maintain a SaaS product is generally unrelated to the value a customer receives, so pricing based on how much margin (profit) you want doesn‚Äôt make sense for the most part. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727517091647497))
	- ‚Ä¢ The recurring nature of SaaS means that value is spread out and captured over time.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Many SaaS products are packaged into different plans, essentially creating different versions of a product, which introduces multiple layers of complexity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727518475751426))
	- Pricing is not a set it and forget it part of your business.
	  
	  It inevitably evolves and requires more attention than most give it.
	  
	  It‚Äôs also one of the most important and underutilized growth levers you can pull. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727519977312256))
	- Think of pricing as the intersection of every part of the business.
	  
	  Given the weight of its importance, how do you decide on a pricing model that makes sense for your business?
	  
	  ‚ÄúPrice is what you pay, value is what you get.‚Äù ‚Äî Warren Buffet ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727520904355846))
	- Just because you *could* charge more doesn‚Äôt mean that you *should.*
	  
	  @mijustin has a great article about applying the right advice at the right time, particularly with pricing.

	- ‚ÄúLet your customers think they got a great deal. They‚Äôll tell friends about you, who then become new customers. And those customers will love you, because you‚Äôll give them good deals too.‚Äù ‚Äî @ryanckulp ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727523064422407))
		- **Tags**: #[[favorite]]
	- The best way to describe ‚Äúgetting a great deal‚Äù is to compare the value a customer receives to the price they pay.
	  
	  1:10 price/value ratio ‚Üí overpriced
	  
	  1:1 price/value ratio ‚Üí looking for something cheaper
	  
	  10:1 price/value ratio ‚Üí customer for life

	- It's great to have a goal for what you want to price your product at and how customers will feel about it.
	  
	  @robwalling calls it "aspirational pricing"
	  
	  https://t.co/4Izl4UR0WW https://t.co/zVbT7riQbZ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727529834041350))
	- What about the actual pricing model? These are the general types you'll see out there.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Flat-rate pricing (e.g. @Basecamp)
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Usage-based pricing (e.g. @Stripe)
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Tier-based pricing (e.g. @Kinsta)
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ User-based pricing (e.g. @Calendly) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727531381690373))
		- **Tags**: #[[favorite]]
	- ‚Ä¢ Feature-based pricing (e.g. @Intercom)
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Credit-based pricing (e.g. @Audible_com)
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Hybrid pricing (e.g. @Drift) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727532426080258))
	- Now for the activation model.
	  
	  Find the activation model that results in the most customers. Not the most leads‚Ä¶ the most customers.
	  
	  Most people focus on lead volume or lead conversion rate, but focus on what actually results in the most customers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727533516537860))
	- These are the five types I've seen most commonly:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Freemium (e.g. @mailchimp)
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Free trial (e.g. @baremetrics)
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Paid trial (e.g. @ahrefs)
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Money-back guarantee (e.g. @wpengine)
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Consultation (e.g. @superhuman) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1399727534380564487))
	- I remember when I was skeptical about Superhuman's approach until I saw this tweet.
	  
	  1,000!

	- The @databoxhq team found that a free trial cut their churn in half.

	- One of @notionhq's secrets to success has been their activation model.
