	- The second most important skill is coordinating the effort of all those you convinced so that it scales well with the number of people. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor/status/1430370098829684742))
	- To some extent, we all harbor this conceit that we alone could do something really amazing. But all the most impressive stuff is accomplished through some monumental coordination of talent and labor. Organizations are the best technology we've invented as humans.

	- I think that's why we're so frustrated when a big group of people can't make progress on a problem, even if they all care about it. We've *seen* groups of people succeed in other contexts. Why is the effort of *this* specific group of people not coordinated and scaling well? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor/status/1430371114950160387))
	- I've always wondered why Herbert Simon (who I've idolized since before grad school) spent so much time studying organizations. I took two org theory courses but never saw their usefulness. I totally get it now. This is a huge revelation for me. I wonder if he saw it all along. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor/status/1430373431179055110))
	- I want to provide a usable implication of this worldview for people working on something right now: The most impactful thing you can do today is ensure that it's desirable and easy for others to build on top of your work. To see why you're doing it and join you in working on it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor/status/1430374090502672386))
