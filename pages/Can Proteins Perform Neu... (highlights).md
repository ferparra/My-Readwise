	- Can proteins perform neural network computation? Together with James Linton, @RonZhu2015, and @ElowitzLab, we had a lot of fun creating the "perceptein" -- a protein circuit that performs winner-take-all neural network computation in mammalian cells: https://t.co/uhFJoYGbJF (1/4) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ZiboChen/status/1546768649691615234))

	- @RonZhu2015 @ElowitzLab We combined engineered viral proteases made in @ElowitzLab with de novo designed heterodimers made in @UWproteindesign to construct circuit modules that take weighted sum of inputs, and performs self-activation and mutual inhibition across the "nodes", also made of proteins (2/4) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ZiboChen/status/1546768692066672641))
	- @RonZhu2015 @ElowitzLab @UWproteindesign The end result was a set of 310 chemical reactions stemming from 8 starting protein species, and when we transfected mammalian cells with plasmids encoding these proteins, they collectively classified signals as predicted in our simulation, with tunable decision boundaries (3/4) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ZiboChen/status/1546768732709535745))
	- @RonZhu2015 @ElowitzLab @UWproteindesign We anticipate the perceptein network to be useful in various applications such as classifying cancer vs. non-cancer cells. This was the exact project that I proposed in my @DamonRunyon postdoc fellowship application, special thanks to Damon Runyon for funding this project!
