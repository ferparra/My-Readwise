	- 1. (Free) InterviewMe's mock server. This is by far the most active Discord server, with hundreds of people online.
	  
	  Great for finding mock interview partners, including for systems design, and to meet other people. Several experienced people hanging out. https://t.co/PyhgszV5Is

	- 2. (Free) Recent Interview Experiences. Uber, Zillow, PayPal, Robolox, Redfin, Intuit, Google, Facebook, Microsoft... take your pick. People share what interviews were like, and talk about them. Don't forget to share back! https://t.co/uKKEBuQQao

	- 3. (Paid) The Systems Design Interview: an Insider's Guide group. After you buy the excellent $29 course (https://t.co/Pilp8e89nL), you get access to this private group. Probably the best place to find mock systems design partners. My book/course review: https://t.co/HNq9K3ic1k
