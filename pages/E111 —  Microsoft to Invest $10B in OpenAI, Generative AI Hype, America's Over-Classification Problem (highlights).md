	- The Prompt Engineer could Become the Proverbial 10x Engineer
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Engineers who are good at talking to and optimizing results for instances will become more valuable in the future., * The economy is moving from a laborbased economy to a narrator-based economy, and as we level up, new work and opportunities will emerge.)

	  I just realized like a great prompt engineer Is going to become a title and an actual scale the ability to interface with these here you go And that's called to engineer Well, no prompt engineer somebody who is very good at talking to these, you know, instances And maximizing the result for them and refining the results for them just like a detective who asked great questions The that person is going to be 10 or 20 times more valuable They could be the proverbial 10x engineer in the future of as a as in a company And as we talk about austerity and doing more with less than the 80 percent less people running twitter now or Amazon laying off 18,000 people sales force laying off 8,000 Facebook laying off 10 and probably another 10,000 What catalytic effect like could this have we could be sitting here in Three or four or five years and Instead of running a company like twitter with 80 percent less people.

	  Maybe you could run it with 98 percent less people Look, I think directionally, it's the the right statement I mean, you know, I've I've made the statement a number of times and I think we move from this idea of Create our economy to narrator economy where historically was kind of labor economy where humans used their physical labor to do things Then we were knowledge workers. We used our our brains to make things And then ultimately we kind of I think resolve to this narrator economy where the the way that you kind of can state intention and better Manipulate the tools to drive your intentional outcome the more success you're going to be And you can kind of think about this as being the artist of the past Da Vinci was What made him so good was he was technically Incredible at trying to reproduce a photographic like imagery using Using paint and there's these really great kind of museum exhibits on how he did it using these really interesting kind of like split mirror systems And then the the better the artist of the 21st century the 20th century was the best user of adobe photoshop And that person is not necessarily the best painter and the artist of the 22nd century isn't Going to look like the photoshop Expert and it's not going to look like the the painter. It's going to look like something entirely different It could be who's who's got the most creative imagination in driving the software to drive new outcomes And I think that the same analogy can be used across every market in every industry However, one thing to note j-cal it's it's not about austerity because the the the lead-eyed argument is When you have new tools and you get more leverage from those tools You have less work for people to do and therefore everyone suffers The reality is new work emerges and new opportunities emerge and we level up as a species And when we level up we all kind of fill the gaps and expand our productivity and our capability set ([Time 1:02:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4b8e097e-2674-4385-b73f-1d2e28d7ab49))
