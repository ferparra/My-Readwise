	- The Rationalist Fallacy amounts to this: that our perspectives are made up of our beliefs.
	  
	  But‚Äîperspectives are made of what we pay attention to! (Our 'attentional policies' https://t.co/mrpuzVweG6) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/edelwax/status/1443961204347604997))

	- We attend to ùíô based on whether, in past situations, attending to ùíô seemed important (for a given set of values).
	  
	  So, all this talk of changing beliefs (confirmation bias, etc) is wrong-headed. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/edelwax/status/1443961205610086404))
	- To change someone's perspective (i.e., their attention policies) give them either:

	  (2) help feeling through feelings, to shift values. https://t.co/bE1daiuDa3
