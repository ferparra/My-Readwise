	- I transitioned from being a software engineer to being a product manager.
	  
	  It was an adjustment that I wish I were better prepared for.
	  
	  I wish someone talked to me about some of the challenges of making this jump, esp re: trying to articulate my value add. ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jtannady/status/1395436534661255174))

	- When I was a SWE, I could very clearly point to what I worked on. Here is a feature or line of code that would not exist if I didn't work on it.
	  
	  That's sometimes harder as a PM. I spend a week on a game plan or in meetings and I look back and wonder whether I was productive. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jtannady/status/1395436535768567817))

	- Cause there's a subset of PM work that engineers can do on their own.
	  
	  Engineers can talk to each other.
	  
	  Engineers can write Google Docs.
	  
	  Engineers can present things.
	  
	  I didn't _have_ to facilitate that. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jtannady/status/1395436536859070471))
	- But then you get engineers who spend a lot of time doing work that doesn't energise them.
	  
	  So as a PM, facilitating productive meetings is value add.
	  
	  Figuring out what discussions need to happen and who needs to be there is value add.
	  
	  Cat herding is value add. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jtannady/status/1395436537815474179))
	- Being able to articulate ideas and getting everyone on the same page is value add.
	  
	  You don't really get points for this at school so it can be a weird reframe to think about this as value add. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jtannady/status/1395436538788515840))
	- The PMs I didn't enjoy working with wanted to be the "CEO of the product" and constantly took credit for everything.
	  
	  I get the sense that they needed to cling onto something out of insecurity.
	  
	  It's scary to question whether you had an impact on a project. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jtannady/status/1395436539736465418))
	- I feel like my PM style was very much informed by the PMs I didn't enjoy working with when I was a SWE.
	  
	  To me, being a product manager is about:
	  
	  1. Simplifying things for people.
	  
	  2. Celebrating people.
	  
	  3. Honouring people and their work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jtannady/status/1395436540709507072))

	- It's also informed by the fact that
	  
	  I don't remember who got an A+ in my classes in school,
	  
	  but I remember who walked to my dorm with a photocopy of the class notes when I was too depressed to show up to class. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jtannady/status/1395436541745446919))
	- tl;dr As a SWE turned PM, I often struggled to articulate my impact.
	  
	  That's terrifying, but if you're making people's lives easier, that is value add.
	  
	  Trust yourself and don't be a butthole to other people in the process. âœ¨ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jtannady/status/1395436542760525824))
