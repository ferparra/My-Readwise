	- What does dependency mapping involve?
	  
	  Here are the key aims:
	  
	  •   Identifying relationships between work tasks
	  •   Working out task order
	  •   Understanding why tasks depend on each other
	  •   Creating a visual representation of the dependencies
	  •   Having a working document that maps out all the dependencies
	  •   Providing a clear overview of the project as a whole ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0btk34zm3dwxymbszecw033))
	- Once you have a visual representation of the dependencies, discuss them as a group. This is a good time to ask the following questions:
	  
	  •   What are the risks associated with this dependency?
	  •   What can we do to mitigate those risks?
	  •   Who is responsible for each dependency?
	  •   What happens if a dependency isn’t met? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0btmbsq6g5qhfx3s1m5dcje))
	- Remember that dependency maps aren’t set in stone. Think of them as living documents you need to amend from time to time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0bx6r35qywp4c91wpvc5q5x))
