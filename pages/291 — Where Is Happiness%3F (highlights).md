	- I think there isn't er gorvadalq around there, which is incredibly ugly
	  
	  Summary:
	  In the thirteenth century, in the summa theologica, he was really re introducing aristotle to audiences. We probably wouldn't read the nicomachian ethics to day were it not for saint thomas aquinas. He defined love as to will the good of the other, as other. This could have been right out of the mouth of the buddha. And when you read aquinas, it's, it's pretty eastern. But this is not about sentimentality. I think there isn't er gorvadalq around there, which is jus incredibly ugly.

	  Oh, it's the worst i mean, envy is a desa is a deadly sin. For that reason, my father was very funny.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  E used to say that, son, remember, it's not enough to win. Your friends have to lose. Heto i think there isn't er gorvadalq around there, which is jus incredibly ugly.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Forget what what i every time one of my friends succeeds, i die a little bit inside. I think it's wat but you know, there'sis theres that there's a western tradition that gets at this in the same way, that 's a little bit easier for most, most of us to understand. And that comes from aquinas, who was really paraphrasing ristotle. So aquinas, of course, in the thirteenth century, in the summa theologica, he was really re introducing, he was, he was a neoplatonist, but he re introduced aristotle to audiences. We probably wouldn't read the nicomachian ethics to day were it not for saint thomas aquinas. And aquinas defined, in arist telian way, what love means, which gets at exactly what we're talking about here. He defined love as to will the good of the other, as other. This could have been right out of the mouth of the buddha. As a matter of fact, he was really impressed and really influenced by many eastern teachings. And when you read aquinas, it's, it's, it's pretty eastern. But to will the good of the other, this is not about sentimentality.

	- All of Happiness Is In The First Derivative
	  
	  Summary:
	  People get better at things through their twenties and thirties. They have focus, the ability to work hard, a lot of working memory. And then it tends to decline in your late thirties or early forties. Sik: Why would you do this trivial kind of hobby instead of doing something that you love? He says humans aren't happy when they're not making progress.

	  So could tell catel, the social psychology, breat great british social psychologist, notice that people, they get better at things through their twenties and thirties, tha kind of ten thousand hours deal, where they have focus, the ability to work hard, a lot of working memory. And almost anything that you can get good at, from being an air pic controller to being a french horn player to being a college professor and researcher in particular, that requires innovative capacity to crack the code to solve problems. That's fluid intelligence. And that gets better and better through your twenties and thirties. And and weirdly, it tends to pique in your late thirties or early forties, and then it tends to decline. And he noticed this, catel noticed this, that these abilities tend to decline. Now, if you're really a striver and you're really good at what you do, and most of the people listening to us right now. They're good at something. They're really the only ones in their forties who are going to notice these declines. And the way that you notice it is what, you know, people in the management world call burn out. So you find that your dentist, for example, when he's, let's say, forty three, has, weirdly, start taking fridays off to golf. Sik, why would you do that? Do this trivial kind of hobby instead of doing something that you you love, like being a dentist? And the answer is, because humans aren't happy when they're not making progress. The mathematicians will put it that all of happiness is in the first derivative, all of happiness is in getting better the stateis. This is a reason, by the way, sam, that that is very easy to lose weight, but it's very hard to keep weight off. Because when the scaleis going down, you're motivatedn ands. When you hit your goal, the the, the, the reward for hitting your goal is now you never get to eat the things you like ever again, for the rest of your life. Congratulations. And, you know, thiss, this is the nature of, you know, how we're wired. Progress is everything. ([Time 0:46:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9f20e15f-d657-492c-bfa7-95e32124d9f0))
	- Is There Any Way In Which You Deplore That?
	  
	  Summary:
	  It's immensely freeing on some level not to know who one is in the world. Mother nature doesn't care if you're happy, and we have urges for money and power and pleasure and fame. Wright o me, you needn't be able to say the appropriate and civil things on cue. You want to know how to dress for dinner, but to wear whatever self concept you have as lightly as possible.

	  Speaker 2
	  So it's just my sense, personally, is that, and i think it's what i believe philos pically, is that you just, you want the fumes of identity to fully dissipate. And it's immensely freeing on some level not to know who one is in the world. It's not that you want your you want to be able to function. You don't want to to have a kind ofpa sa with respect to how you navigate social rolls. Wright o me, you needn't be able to say the appropriate and civil things on cue. You want to know, we know how to dress for dinner, but to wear whatever self concept you have as lightly as possible, so that it really, i's just not the place from which you're relating to the next moment of experience. That's what seems opibale to me. Is there any way in which ha, you disagree with it? No, idusno.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  There's no way that i disagree with that. I think that's exactly right. But i also will well point out that that is not, that is not human nature. And that brings me to my sort of overarching point, which is that mother nature doesn't care if you're happy. Mother nature has other goals for you. Andt the great crossing of circuits in the human mind, as far as i'm concerned, is that that we want to be happy, and we have urges for money and power and pleasure and fame.
