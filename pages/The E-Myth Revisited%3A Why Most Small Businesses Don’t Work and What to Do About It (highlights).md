	- That myth, that misunderstanding, I call the E-Myth, the myth of the entrepreneur. And it finds its roots in this country in a romantic belief that small businesses are started by entrepreneurs, when, in fact, most are not. **That Fatal Assumption is: if you understand the technical work of a business, you understand a business that does that technical work. And the reason it’s fatal is that it just isn’t true. In fact, it’s the root cause of most small business failures! The technical work of a business and a business that does that technical work are two totally different things! But the technician who starts a business fails to see this. To the technician suffering from an Entrepreneurial Seizure, a business is not a business but a place to go to work.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsv33s053y5c4dmrs3hv7zy4))
		- **Note**: The E-Myth is a myth about entrepreneurs, which is a kind of business owner. This myth says that most small businesses are started by entrepreneurs, which isn't true. The Fatal Assumption is that if you know how to do the technical work in a business, you know how to run the business. This is not true, because there is a big difference between doing the technical work of a business and running the business. But, a technician (someone who knows the technical work) may not understand this. To the technician, the business is just a place to do their job.
	- “Simply put, your job is to prepare yourself and your business for growth. “To educate yourself sufficiently so that, as your business grows, the business’s foundation and structure can carry the additional weight. “And as awesome a responsibility as that may seem to you, you have no other choice—if your business is to thrive, that is. “It’s up to you to dictate your business’s rate of growth as best you can by understanding the key processes that need to be performed, the key objectives that need to be achieved, the key position you are aiming your business to hold in the marketplace.

		- **Note**: The author states that the job of a business owner is to prepare themselves and the business for growth. They must educate themselves to ensure that the business is able to handle the increased growth and responsibility. The business owner must also be aware of the key processes, objectives, and marketplace position needed for success.
	- The Entrepreneurial Perspective adopts a wider, more expansive scale. It views the business as a network of seamlessly integrated components, each contributing to some larger pattern that comes together in such a way as to produce a specifically planned result, a systematic way of doing business. Said another way, the Entrepreneurial Model has less to do with what’s done in a business and more to do with how it’s done. The commodity isn’t what’s important—the way it’s delivered is. Thus, the Entrepreneurial Model does not start with a picture of the business to be created but of the customer for whom the business is to be created. It understands that without a clear picture of that customer, no business can succeed. To The Entrepreneur, the business is the product.

	- **How can I create a business whose results are systems-dependent rather than people-dependent? Systems-dependent rather than expert-dependent.** It is literally impossible to produce a consistent result in a business that depends on extraordinary people. No business can do it for long. And no extraordinary business tries to! Because every extraordinary business knows that when you intentionally build your business around the skills of ordinary people, you will be forced to ask the difficult questions about how to produce a result without the extraordinary ones. You will be forced to find a system that leverages your ordinary people to the point where they can produce extraordinary results over and over again.

		- **Note**: Creating a business whose results depend on systems instead of people is difficult, but possible. It's not possible to always get the same result when you rely on extraordinary people, so the best way to do it is to build your business around ordinary people. That way, you can ask hard questions about how to make sure that even though you don't have extraordinary people, you can still get the same results over and over again.
	- The commercial is saying, “Buy Chanel and this fantasy can be yours.” **What’s your product? What feeling will your customer walk away with? Peace of mind? Order? Power? Love? What is he really buying when he buys from you? The truth is, nobody’s interested in the commodity. People buy feelings.** And as the world becomes more and more complex, and the commodities more varied, the feelings we want become more urgent, less rational, more unconscious. How your business anticipates those feelings and satisfies them is your product. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsv45jfz0bw7qncxj9wrxv50))
		- **Note**: This passage suggests that customers are not interested in simply buying a commodity, but rather they are buying feelings. It states that as the world becomes more complex, people look for more urgent, less rational and more unconscious feelings which can be satisfied by the products of a business. Thus, businesses should focus on how their products can anticipate and satisfy these feelings.
	- **Your Marketing Strategy starts, ends, lives, and dies with your customer. So in the development of your Marketing Strategy, it is absolutely imperative that you forget about your dreams, forget about your visions, forget about your interests, forget about what you want—forget about everything but your customer! When it comes to marketing, what you want is unimportant. It’s what your customer wants that matters. And what your customer wants is probably significantly different from what you think he wants.** The question then becomes: If my customer doesn’t know what he wants, how can I? The answer is, you can’t! Not unless you know more about him than he does about himself. Not unless you know his demographics and his psychographics. Demographics and psychographics are the two essential pillars supporting a successful marketing program. If you know who your customer is—demographics—you can then determine why he buys—psychographics...And so, while the VP/Marketing and the VP/Operations and the VP/Finance each have their own specific accountabilities, they share one common purpose—to make a promise their customer wants to hear, and to deliver on that promise better than anyone else on the block! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsv460pvgby1a65nj8cwp5kf))
		- **Note**: This text explains that to create a successful marketing strategy, one must forget about their own desires and focus on what the customer wants. Knowing the customer's demographics and psychographics is essential for understanding why they buy, and all departments must work together to make a promise that the customer wants to hear and deliver on it better than anyone else.
	- That your Primary Aim and your Strategic Objective and your Organizational Strategy and your Management Strategy and your People Strategy and your Marketing Strategy and your Systems Strategy—all of them are totally interdependent, rather than independent of one another. That the success of your Business Development Program totally depends on your appreciation of that integration. And that your Prototype is that integration. If you understand all of that, then this book has been worth our time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsv46nk47rtc21he62n1q8ev))
		- **Note**: "Your Primary Aim and your other plans, like the Organizational Strategy, Management Strategy, People Strategy, Marketing Strategy, and Systems Strategy, all work together. This means that if you want your Business Development Program to be successful, you need to look at how all of these plans fit together. This is called integration. If you understand this, then this book has been worth your time."
