	- Twitter Lists and Topics:

	  Scroll through the relevant Twitter Topics and make lists as you come across interesting people.
	  
	  Follow the content and reply with your amazing insights. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandanat/status/1457730638010740742))
	- A shortcut for making Twitter Lists:
	  
	  Look up a user's SparkScore. (It's a free @SparkToro tool!)
	  
	  Under Related Accounts you'll see 9 accounts that user frequently engages with.
	  
	  This may indicate they're in a similar niche, and you can add them all to your List.
	  
	  Here's mine:

	- LinkedIn Search:
	  
	  Search for a job function that represents your ideal customer, and filter by location, 1st/2nd/3rd connection, etc.
	  
	  If they post, engage with their content. Pay attention to others' replies too.
	  
	  (Don't immediately slide into their DMs with a pitch. ðŸ˜‚) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandanat/status/1457730647267573761))
	- Reddit:
	  
	  Find a new and trending post. Jump in with an awesome comment â€” one that's relevant, detailed, and ideally, has a link to your site.
	  
	  (Do the same on Quora.)

	- Slack, Circle, etc:
	  
	  As you get to know more people on social media, you'll start to be aware of private communities.
	  
	  For example, some marketing ones:
	  
	  â€¢ DTC Fam
	  â€¢ Superpath
	  â€¢ Swipe Files
	  â€¢ Demand Curve
	  â€¢ Forget the Funnel
	  
	  Join and participate. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amandanat/status/1457730649809293315))
	- But this takes a lot of time.
	  
	  And you'd still have to research the influential podcasts, blogs, and YouTube channels to:
	  
	  â€¢ Consume
	  â€¢ Pay to sponsor
	  â€¢ Create content with
	  â€¢ Pitch yourself as a guest for
	  
	  This will take you weeks.
