	- I have done hundreds of analytical SQL coding interviews. My standards are higher than most. Here’s what you need to know to pass it. https://t.co/twaMvGxi1f ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teej_m/status/1626694269879881728))

	- My interview is bring-your-own-DB. I will describe some tables and ask you to write queries.
	  
	  I will act as the query interface. You can ask me to look up function names at any time.
	  
	  Just pick a database. I’m not impressed by breadth just tell me what you know. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teej_m/status/1626694272895553539))
	- Question 1 (easy) –
	  
	  Two tables, one has the names & IDs of sports teams, second has matches with winner/loser IDs.
	  
	  Tell me the top 10 teams by wins for the 2022 season.
	  
	  Required skills: select, group, filter, join ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teej_m/status/1626694275735101440))
	- Question 1.5 (med) –
	  
	  Same data + new table that’s win count by team for 2022.
	  
	  Tell me the top 9 teams by wins for 2022, plus a 10th row for “all others”.
	  
	  This question has 5+ valid solutions. I don’t care which you find.
	  
	  Skills: CTE/subquery, union, antijoin, self-join ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teej_m/status/1626694278616584192))
	- Question 2 (med) –
	  
	  One table that represents customer purchases.
	  
	  A repeat customer is someone who makes 2+ purchases, but 2+ on the same day doesn’t count. Tell me how many repeat customers we have.
	  
	  I want to see you break this into steps.
	  
	  Skills: CTE, grouping, aggregation ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teej_m/status/1626694281888149504))
	- Question 3 (hard) –
	  
	  Two tables, one is customer purchases, the second is marketing touches.
	  
	  Tell me the count of customers with only organic orders on a last touch attribution basis.
	  
	  Skills: window functions, range joins ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teej_m/status/1626694284123717633))
	- If you nail those three - you’ve passed. Super solid responses on 1&2 is all I need though.
	  
	  If you’re struggling at one level, I’ll rotate in others at that difficulty. Otherwise if you breeze through it, I’ll keep ramping up the difficulty. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teej_m/status/1626694286116016128))
	- You should probably know:
	  
	  Select/from/where
	  CTEs
	  Join
	  Group by
	  Filtering techniques (where/having/in/not in)
	  Basic data types
	  
	  I don’t care about:
	  
	  DML
	  Indexes
	  temp tables
	  Performance ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teej_m/status/1626694288125075457))
	- Most important: you need to learn how to do a technical interview.
	  
	  It’s not a quiz, it’s an audition. Silent and technically correct is a failure.
	  
	  Talk, a lot. Ask questions. Walk me through the problem and how you want to solve it.
	  
	  I need to know we can do the work together. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teej_m/status/1626700852726493184))
