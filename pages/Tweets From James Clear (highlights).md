	- My writing approach:
	  
	  I rarely have good ideas. To overcome this limitation, I think about one topic (e.g. habits) for an unreasonable amount of time.
	  
	  Then, after lots of reading and research, I revise, revise, revise until only the best stuff remains.
	  
	  It’s slow, but it works!

	- I admire people who can turn it on and turn it off.
	  
	  Be a gentle spirit with most, but stand firm whenever necessary.
	  
	  Don’t take yourself so seriously most days, but turn into a straight killer when the game begins.
	  
	  Etc.
	  
	  Being one thing all the time is suboptimal. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1371241431692611585))
	- Where you apply your effort matters more than how much effort you apply.
	  
	  You might be able to work 10% harder, but working on the right thing can deliver 100x results.
	  
	  Unfortunately, most days we are too busy working on the next thing to ask if we are working on the best thing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1089882676780253184))
	- A simple question to spot gaps in your thinking:
	  
	  "What do I want to be true?"
	  
	  If you're broke, you want the get-rich-quick scheme to be true. If you run a startup, you want the questionable growth metrics to be true.
	  
	  It's easy to fool yourself when you want to be fooled. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1156247546152534017))
	- The antidote to a bad day is a good workout. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1415051929059725313))
	- Your biological age is the number of days you’ve lived.
	  
	  Your psychological age is the number of thoughts you’ve entertained.
	  
	  Your sociological age is the number of contributions you’ve made. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1295738096638623744))
	- What is one book that is a quick and easy read, but contains a tremendous amount of wisdom?

	- The feeling of progress is one of the best feelings of all. This is true even when progress is small. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1300504000647827456))
	- “How did you accomplish that?”
	  
	  “Same as everything else. Gradually, then all at once.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1376201643482570753))
	- Maturity is learning how to start when you feel like procrastinating and learning how to listen when you feel like talking. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1310290784684511234))

	- A simple rule for life and work:

	  Thoughtful action. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1364074533741883395))

	- Clarity is the elimination of mental clutter.
	  
	  Agility is the elimination of physical clutter.
	  
	  Tranquility is the elimination of spiritual clutter. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1309972966369890307))
