	- I spent 6 hours using ChatGPT, MidJourney, and a couple of other AI tools to make a fan-made Batman animated movie!

	- It started with the idea I had. I knew it was going to be about The Riddler (one of my favorites, and a huge fan of @mattreevesLAâ€™s and Paul Danoâ€™s rendition of the character) so I gave ChatGPT the prompt and we went back and forth on the monologue

	- I then used MidJourney to generate the artwork, broke down the lines from the script into different scenes I wanted and then went back and forth till I got a style that fit the eerie vibe I was going for

	- The problem with those images though is theyâ€™re usually pretty low-res, so to get a quality still for a 4K video, I used Pixelmator to has this magical AI upscaling feature where it preserves the quality of a picture but can blow up the resolution all the way to 4K+!

	- Then, the fun part. Itâ€™s got to move and feel alive! So to bring these stills to life, I used Motionleap on my iPhone, imported each image, and just drew on the parts of the image where I wanted movement! Itâ€™s that easy to bring something like a static mysterious fog to life. https://t.co/EjOI6YmTYB ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ammaar/status/1615133153831813120))
	- For the dialog, Iâ€¦ recorded it myself ðŸ˜…, but used Adobeâ€™s AI tool to turn the audio into studio level quality and then just lowered the pitch!

	- Finally, put it all together with some touches in Final Cut Pro, and boom! A fun little Batman animated short. Big thank you to @angrypenguinPNG and @rileybrown_ai for their tweets that inspired this!
