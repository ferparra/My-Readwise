	- The Soviet Union fell apart on the issue of Ukraine. The first to raise the banner of independence were the Baltic states, but they’re small countries and they’re not Slavic.
	- The Central Asian republics were really pushed out of the Soviet Union because Russia was not interested in a union with them without Ukraine.
	- Ukraine becomes a democratic state; Russia moves in an authoritarian direction. This automatically puts Russia’s relations with Europe in a difficult position and issues of security become very important.
