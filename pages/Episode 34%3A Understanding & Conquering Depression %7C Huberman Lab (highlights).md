document_note:: In this episode of Huberman Lab, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses major depression at a biological and physiological level, treatments to prevent and treat depression, the chemical systems altered in depression, and preventive lifestyle interventions. He explains that the pleasure-pain system is a scale; if it is overwhelmed, it can lead to anhedonia and depression. He also discusses the effects of hormones and stress, pharmaceutical treatments, exercise, nutrition and inflammation on depression, and treatments such as ketamine, psilocybin, and the ketogenic diet.
