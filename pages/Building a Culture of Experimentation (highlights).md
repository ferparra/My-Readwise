	- Booking.com runs more than 1,000 rigorous tests simultaneously and, by my estimates, more than 25,000 tests a year. At any given time, quadrillions (millions of billions) of landing-page permutations are live, meaning two customers in the same location are unlikely to see the same version. All this experimentation has helped transform the company from a small Dutch start-up to the world’s largest online accommodation platform in less than two decades.

	- Many organizations are also too conservative about the nature and amount of experimentation. Overemphasizing the importance of successful experiments may encourage employees to focus on familiar solutions or those that they already know will work and avoid testing ideas that they fear might fail. And it’s actually less risky to run a large number of experiments than a small number. At Booking.com, only about 10% of experiments generate positive results—meaning that “B,” a modification that attempts to improve something (sales, repeat usage, click-through rates, or the time users spend on the site, for example), performs better among randomly assigned users than “A,” the control, which is the status quo. (In addition to A/B tests, Booking.com also runs more-complex tests that assess more than one modification at the same time.) But when you conduct a large volume of experiments, a low success rate still translates into a significant number of successes, which, in turn, diminish the financial and emotional costs of the failures. If a company does only a handful of experiments a year, it may have only one success or, if it’s unlucky, none. Then failure is a big deal.

	- “Somewhat ironically, the centralizing of our experimentation infrastructure is what makes our organizational decentralization possible,” Vermeer explained to me. “Everyone uses the same tools. This fosters trust in each other’s data and enables discussion and accountability. While some companies, like Microsoft, Facebook, and Google, may be more technically advanced in areas like machine learning, our use of simple A/B tests makes us more successful in getting all people involved; we have democratized testing throughout the organization.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx3713cereyg6wx5znyghvxf))
	- By democratizing experimentation and following test results where they lead, companies can enable employees to make good decisions on their own and accelerate innovation and improvements. But if most decisions are made this way, what’s left for senior leaders to do, beyond developing the company’s strategic direction and tackling big decisions such as which acquisitions to make?

	- Scientifically testing nearly every idea requires infrastructure: instrumentation, data pipelines, and data scientists. Several third-party tools and services make it easy to try experiments, but to scale things up, senior leaders must tightly integrate the testing capability into company processes. Doing so requires striking the right balance between centralization and decentralization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx3724nzrp83p403rw3t86as))
