- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Dec 17th, 2022]]
	- Huge news: after 1.5 years of private beta, thousands of testers, and a looot of incredible work by the team...
	  
	  @ReadwiseReader is finally in public beta!
	  
	  Save everything to one place, highlight like a pro, and replace several apps with one.

	- @ReadwiseReader Reader does A LOT, but before I get into features, here's its main benefit:
	  
	  Get all your content into one place.
	  
	  From articles to Twitter threads to PDFs to newsletters to RSS to epubs to... even YouTube!

	- @ReadwiseReader With all your content in Reader, you can then read, search, organize and (of course) highlight it.
	  
	  And you can read from any device: Web to iOS to Android üíªüçéü§ñ

	- @ReadwiseReader For the right type of person (ie if you read a lot!), Reader is the best way to read.
	  
	  As we now shift to public beta, here's what our beta testers are saying:

	- @ReadwiseReader Readwise was built on a foundation of highlights so we built highlighting as a first-class feature from day one:
	  
	  * highlight images & formatting üñºüìä
	  * add notes/tags effortlessly üìùüè∑
	  * highlight using keyboard or double tap on mobile ‚å®ü§≥ https://t.co/2BPagziFpS ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/homsiT/status/1603145628841918465))
	- @ReadwiseReader We love flexible software like @notion, @airtable, and @obsdmd with low bars and high ceilings. 
	  
	  Inspired by them, you can think of your Reader account as one giant database.
	  
	  You can then use ~filtered views~ based on queries to organize and customize workflows https://t.co/AXLpnqBu0d ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/homsiT/status/1603145868869345290))
	- @ReadwiseReader @notion @airtable @obsdmd Another very relevant feature is our twitter lists integration 
	  
	  You can ofc save twitter threads as you find them, but also subscribe to any list and process all new tweets you're interested in in a batch.
	  
	  Minimize the attention-sucking screentime, without FOMO üê¶üíô https://t.co/wreqc2ncgc ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/homsiT/status/1603146401264836609))
	- @ReadwiseReader @notion @airtable @obsdmd Another novelty of the Feed is a TikTok-UI for cruising through new items like a warm knife through butter. You can easily get through 100 to 200 items per day without breaking sweat. https://t.co/EOkC0CZOms ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/homsiT/status/1603146572187025409))
	- @ReadwiseReader @notion @airtable @obsdmd New reading apps are typically mobile-only. While our mobile apps are great, Reader had a web app from day one.
	  
	  We've crafted a keyboard-based reading experience enabling you to read, highlight, and annotate without ever using the mouse ‚å®Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è https://t.co/czRDt6SRV2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/homsiT/status/1603146811564236801))
	- @ReadwiseReader @notion @airtable @obsdmd Reader also comes packaged with the most powerful highlighter browser extension we know of
	  
	  What makes it unique is highlights (& notes/tags) bidirectionally sync with the app.
	  
	  So if you highlight the open web, the highlights will appear on the clean document and vice versa üñç https://t.co/rtwzLOUKo0 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/homsiT/status/1603147682733768704))
	- @ReadwiseReader @notion @airtable @obsdmd You can also share annotated versions of your highlighted docs with friends, family, and colleagues. We wrote a whole thread about it here:

	- @ReadwiseReader @notion @airtable @obsdmd YouTube has evolved into the best learning platform out there. 
	  
	  In Reader, you can watch @YouTube alongside time-synced transcripts, and take notes and highlights as it plays.
	  
	  We just shipped this 2 days ago, but the feedback his been pretty ü§Ø

	- @ReadwiseReader @notion @airtable @obsdmd @YouTube Ok one more big one... we've built the latest AI tech into Reader to help you read better. 
	  
	  There are lots of [[GPT-3]] based copilots for writing, but Reader incorporates the first copilot of reading. 
	  
	  We call it Ghostreader: https://t.co/U8QUr5YA2W ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/homsiT/status/1603148003799449603))
	- @ReadwiseReader @notion @airtable @obsdmd @YouTube Of course, every highlight you take in Reader automatically syncs with Readwise for automatic exporting to your favorite note-taking app including:
	  
	  @NotionHQ
	  @obsdmd 
	  @RoamResearch 
	  @logseq 
	  @evernote 
	  
	  and others!

	- @ReadwiseReader @notion @airtable @obsdmd @YouTube @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @logseq @evernote to close, this feedback in particular (of a user who used Reader to read 100+ documents related to their illness & figure out a solution) touched me ü•≤
	  
	  Reader isn't for everyone, but if you spend hours a week reading/researching/learning, it can really change the way you do that

	- ofc, Reader would not at all be possible without our INCREDIBLE team
	  
	  so much to say, but they've all done some of the best work i've ever seen

	- @erinmuur @ArtemLitch @anzi11ah @TucciMatias @lynchy010 @tdkte @Sirupsen @brvn0jm @romikid @jessebc @mirchich @EleanorKonik There's a lot more to Reader than in this thread -- we've done everything we can to genuinely improve the practice of reading for the sake of learning.
	  
	  You can read about that all in our launch blog post:

	  As always, still so much to build :)
