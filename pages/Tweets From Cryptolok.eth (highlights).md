	- @RaoulGMI @RaoulGMI same feeling when I had started in Discord. Did two things
	  1 of 2 - After thorough research on any server, decided which channels I wanna engage / follow. Muted all others and kept “hide muted channel” in the settings. Life is all peaceful now. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/loksaha/status/1493764544342097923))
	- @RaoulGMI 2 of 2 - Created my own server where I pulled all the announcements from the important announcement channel of the servers I’m in. No loss of track for imp announcements. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/loksaha/status/1493764698013061120))
