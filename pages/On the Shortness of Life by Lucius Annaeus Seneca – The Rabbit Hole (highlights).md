	- Men may live to be old but may not live at all. Do not be distracted by pointless actions, jobs, thoughts, people, etc. Live passionately and you will live a long life no matter how young you die
	- he man who lives correctly is never worried about dying
	- And so there is no reason for you to think that any man has lived long because he has grey hairs or wrinkles; he has not lived long—he has existed long.
	- Life is divided into three periods—that which has been, that which is, that which will be. Of these the present time is short, the future is doubtful, the past is certain
	- But those who forget the past, neglect the present, and fear for the future have a life that is very brief and troubled
	- It is not that we have a short space of time, but that we waste much of it.
	- The part of life we really live is small. For all the rest of existence is not life, but merely time.
	- All the greatest blessings are a source of anxiety, and at no time should fortune be less trusted than when it is best
	- And so when you see a man often wearing the robe of office, when you see one whose name is famous in the Forum, do not envy him; those things are bought at the price of life. They will waste all their years, in order that they may have one year reckoned by their name.
