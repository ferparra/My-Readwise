	- Create a basic 3D game prototype like Doom using GPT-4.
	  
	  Let GPT do all the maths, raycasting and hard work!

		- **Note**: Thread
	- First of all: lower your expectations üòÖ. What we are going to create is a super basic prototype. No enemies or shooting. Just a 3D maze-like map that we can move through!
	  
	  I don't think @ID_AA_Carmack will be proud of us üòÇ. But it's a good start!
	  
	  It's a stress test for GPT! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/javilopen/status/1636085119785263104))
	- 1. Simply ask GPT to create a game in the style of "Doom." If you prefer a concise request, you can ask it to refrain from providing explanations or adding comments.
	  
	  But if you want to learn about raycasting, let him teach you, of course!

	- 2. Copy and code paste the source code here in an online HTML/Javascript editor and click "Run": https://t.co/zqR6wD1gZk
	  
	  It's possible that the first version it gives you will be in 2d. Like this one: https://t.co/OUCgYzlafQ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/javilopen/status/1636085171383603202))
	- 3. Now, to have in 3D, we just have to ask nicely to ChatGPT.

	- The first approach will be something like this.
	  
	  Quite boring, isn't it? https://t.co/pvn6vAiHa6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/javilopen/status/1636085228220616704))
	- This is because he only created a basic "empty square room," where the number 1s represent the walls. To add new walls or modify the layout of the room, you can simply change some of the 1s to 0s.

	- 4. However, if you want to enhance the game's visual appeal, you can ask GPT to add "color walls" to the code, and it will do so, of course! Now, based on the distance between the player and the wall, the color of the wall will gradually change from white to pink. https://t.co/7dHa0dod3L ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/javilopen/status/1636085283522506752))
	- It's impressive how GPT was able to use "quite advanced" mathematical algorithms to create this.

	- If you want a better explanation, you can always ask GPT-4. Alternatively, if @ID_AA_Carmack is available, they may be able to provide a more comprehensive explanation üòâ

	- From here, you can save the code and copy-paste it on another day to ask GPT for any improvements you can think of.
	  
	  With enough time, you can add enemies, weapons, and other features to enhance the game.
	  
	  I'll do it myself if there's enough interest! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/javilopen/status/1636085305580322817))
	- Did you like it?
	  
	  If you enjoyed it, an RT to the first tweet of the thread would give me the encouragement to continue conducting experiments like this.
	  
	  Thank you! üôè

	- We interrupt this broadcast to announce the release of Midjourney v5.
	  
	  Come and see for yourself!

	- Ah! And more about GPT-4 here! Can't stop!
