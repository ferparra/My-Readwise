	- closed beta vs. mass freemium? 
	  
	  Before you choose to launch with a closed beta, here are some considerations: 
	  
	  • Waitlists only work if there's scarcity and demand
	  • Demand = product innovation & reputation
	  • If the learning curve is low: self-serve > onboarding ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1197953702553718784))

	- 2/ A closed beta can set valuable parameters for early customer development. 
	  
	  Works well if you have a strong network 👍
	  Limits learning & development if you don't ❌ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1197953704839663616))
	- 3/ A closed beta should always be accommodated by a waitlist. 
	  
	  Without a detailed pipeline, it's impossible to spot bias in the model or identify new opportunities.  
	  
	  Investigate: 
	  Job title 
	  Company size 
	  Team size
	  Tech stack: integrations & core tools
	  Willingness to pay ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1197953705716281344))
	- 4/ Waitlists require substance! 🚨
	  
	  To successfully build a waitlist requires: 
	  
	  • Deep understanding of users: known problem! 
	  • Positioning that resonates: we have the solution! 
	  • Scarcity: limited access + proof of quality customers ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1197953706529964032))
	- 5/ Building demand for a closed beta is an art and science. 
	  
	  In a world of "too many tools," an obvious product innovation is required to build demand. 
	  
	  If not, users will seek currently available tools. 
	  Many of which are free. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1197953707360452608))
	- 6/ Building demand for an unknown product requires social momentum. 
	  
	  Known founder👍
	  Proven team👍
	  Validation from customers/experts👍
	  Competing head-on w/ market leader👍 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1197953708207702016))
	- 7/ In most cases, freemium traction yields more momentum for first time founders. 
	  
	  Broad experimentation and organic adoption = accelerated learning across a number of axes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1197953708992024576))
	- 8/ If the learning curve is low, self-serve is better than manual on-boarding. 
	  
	  Especially true for 
	  
	  Developers: time poor, prefer self-serve
	  Customer support: measured on efficiency 
	  Sales: seek fast ROI, easy to install tools ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1197953709772165120))
