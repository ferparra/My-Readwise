document_note:: The Fifth Discipline provides an overview of what a learning organization is and why it is essential in today's world. It outlines five core disciplines that can help any organization gain a competitive advantage, such as personal mastery, mental models, building shared visions, team learning and systems thinking. These disciplines help to create interconnected thinking, foster team learning, form a clearer vision, and understand the underlying issues behind poor business performance. They also promote intellectual and problem-solving growth, new skills, and better intuition. Finally, learning organizations are active, forward-thinking, dynamic, productive, communal, and innovative.

	- **Personal mastery** – mastering one’s focus, energy and patience can go some way to creating a well rounded individual of great worth to any organization ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj21graqh5bf53yj2ms3c0p))
	- **Mental models** – understanding the role our ingrained mentality and prejudiced perceptions play in our decision making
	  
	  1.  Altering mindsets has to come before altering reality
	  2.  Mental models exist solely in the mind, are never perfect, are resistant to change and affect actions
	  3.  To alter mental models must create alternatives, encourage new ways of thinking, become more self-aware of biases inherent in all mental models, get people to ask questions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj21n4vkf8ap7pzmsg0kqak))
		- **Note**: The Fifth Discipline discusses the importance of altering mindsets in order to create change in reality. It outlines that mental models exist in the mind, are never perfect, and can be resistant to change. To alter mental models, people must create alternatives, encourage new ways of thinking, become aware of biases, and ask questions.
	- **Building shared visions** – a team-shared vision for the future is more beneficial to a company than a few disparate visions promoted by self-obsessed employees
	  
	  1.  Many people have vision but pooling that passion into a shared vision can bring outstanding results
	  2.  Build shared vision by: suppressing egos, encourage people to share in the vision, allow the vision to grow over time but don’t avoid directing it when needed
	  3.  The shared vision is the centerpiece, the final expression of each individual
	  4.  “When you are immersed in a vision, you know what needs to be done. But you often don’t know how to do it.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj221y5qqdcxrj3xg26mkt3))
		- **Note**: The Fifth Discipline encourages teams to build a shared vision for the future, as this can bring far greater results than when each individual has their own vision. To do this, egos must be suppressed and people should be encouraged to share in the vision. It is important for the vision to be allowed to develop over time, but it must be directed when necessary. According to the document, when immersed in the shared vision, people know what needs to be done, but may not know how to do it.
	- **Team learning** – team work that brings together combined knowledge and expertise creates a fulfilling, powerful collective
	  
	  1.  Team learning is all about collaborating and combining in order to point the organization, with all its acquired and assembled skills, in one clear direction, reaching all goals
	  2.  Foster team learning by: creating platform for open debates, encourage conflict, create learning platforms (come together in a fun, stimulating environment outside the office) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj22hc8m2qrfe5mfc2jpkn0))
		- **Note**: Team learning is a concept that encourages combining knowledge and expertise amongst an organization to create powerful collective results. It is essential to create a platform for open debates, encourage conflict and create learning platforms outside the office in order to foster team learning.
	- **Systems thinking** – encourages businesses to look at the bigger picture, thereby providing sustainable long-term, rather than short-term, solutions to problem
	  
	  1.  Systems thinking is the fulcrum, it is the driving force upon which the performance of the other disciplines hinge
	  2.  Encourages us to spot patterns that are affecting our performance and subsequently analyze them for any possible improvement. It does not simply look at the consequences of an event and seek to eradicate the problem ‘for now’
	  3.  All about preventing long-term problems
	  4.  The system is often the problem with a company’s poor performance so you should carefully examine the underlying issues plaguing poor business performance
	  5.  Systems thinking discourages quick fixes and says no to short-cut solutions
	  6.  Must focus on cause and effect – solve the root of the problem rather than always fighting fires
	  7.  Can often find small changes that lead to huge improvements in results – leverage points are key to find
	    1.  Leverage becomes possible when you consider the structure behind the results ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj233zamhr23pssxksgh81a))
		- **Note**: Systems thinking is a discipline that encourages businesses to look at the bigger picture, thereby providing sustainable long-term solutions to problems, rather than quick fixes. It focuses on the cause and effect of underlying issues that can be solved for improved performance, and emphasizes the importance of leverage points that can lead to huge improvements in results. It encourages us to spot patterns and analyze them for any possible improvement, and discourages short-cut solutions.
