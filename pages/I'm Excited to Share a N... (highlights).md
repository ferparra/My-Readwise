	- I'm excited to share a new growth framework that @danhockenmaier and I have been developing (with help from the amazing @reforge crew)
	  
	  I've been finding myself coming back to this framework often when talking to founders about growth.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ As a startup, it's essential that you, and your team, have a clear understanding of how your business is likely to grow. We call this building a Growth Model. With this, you'll know which growth investments to make right away, which to avoid, and which to double-down on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1352339633166712833))
	- 2/ Our advice is to think about your business like a high-performance race car. The same four components that help a car drive faster also help your business grow:

	- 1. ‚öôÔ∏è The (Growth) Engine: Self-sustaining growth loops that drive most of your growth (e.g. virality, perf marketing, content, sales)
	  
	  2. üí• Turbo boosts: One-off events that accelerate growth temporarily but don‚Äôt last (e.g. PR, events, Super Bowl ads) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1352339639898521604))
	- 3. üíß Lubricants: Optimizations that make the growth engine run more efficiently (e.g. improved conversion, a stronger brand, higher customer retention).
	  
	  4. ‚õΩ Fuel: The input that your engine requires to run (e.g. capital, content, users). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1352339641425252352))
	- 3/ All four of these components help your business grow, but understanding your Growth Engine is the most important part because it‚Äôs the only component with the potential to be self-sustaining. e.g. engines naturally create an output that can then be re-invested in more growth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1352339642998132737))
	- 4/ ‚öôÔ∏è GROWTH ENGINE(S)
	  
	  Companies grow primarily through four possible Growth Engines:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Performance marketing: FB, AdWords, TV, etc.
	  ‚Ä¢ Virality: Word-of-mouth, referrals, inviting friends, etc.
	  ‚Ä¢ Content: SEO, shareable videos, or newsletters, etc.
	  ‚Ä¢ Sales: Salespeople ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1352339644847857664))
	- 5/ Using just these four engines, we can explain the growth of every breakout success. Here are a few examples:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Uber/Lyft: Virality + Performance marketing
	  ‚Ä¢ Snapchat: Virality
	  ‚Ä¢ Zoom: Virality + Sales
	  ‚Ä¢ Slack: Virality + Sales
	  ‚Ä¢ Salesforce: Sales

	- 6/ Check out our previous @firstround review piece where we outline a 3 step process to determine which engine is likely going to drive your business's growth and how to operationalize it.

	- 7/ üí• TURBO BOOSTS
	  Next, we have Turbo Boosts. Similar to a turbocharger in a car, these are tactics that can accelerate growth for a period of time but don‚Äôt deliver ongoing acceleration. They include things like:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ PR
	  ‚Ä¢ Events
	  ‚Ä¢ Brand marketing campaigns ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1352339650971459584))
	- 8/ These tactics aren‚Äôt "engines," because in most cases they aren‚Äôt sustainable and repeatable at scale. For example, any startup that has received the ‚ÄúTechCrunch bump‚Äù knows that it can give you a nice boost in traffic, but it‚Äôs often not clear what to do next. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1352339652154298368))
	- 9/ However, Turbo Boosts can still be very valuable tools for kickstarting and accelerating your growth rate, particularly at important inflection points for your company, like lighting the initial spark, or launching a new product or market.

	- 10/ üíß LUBRICANTS
	  Third, we have lubricants. Lubricants don‚Äôt drive growth directly, but instead optimize the efficiency of your engine. Also, without enough lubrication, your engine will stop. There are 3 broad categories of lubricants:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Conversion
	  ‚Ä¢ Activation
	  ‚Ä¢ Retention ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1352339655006380037))
	- 11/ Of these three categories, retention is the most important, as Brian lays out in this post.

	- 12/ ‚õΩ FUEL
	  Finally, we have Fuel. Without it, even the most optimized engine won‚Äôt run. The type of fuel required is specific to the type of growth engine you‚Äôre running:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Paid marketing and sales engines primarily need capital, which can be invested in ads or salespeople ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1352339658273771521))
	- 13/ 
	  ‚Ä¢ Content engines unsurprisingly need more content, which can be used to attract users. 
	  ‚Ä¢ Viral engines require only more users, who in turn refer additional users. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1352339659758555136))

	  Huge shout-out to @bbalfour and @onecaseman for their help with this post, and to my brother-from-another-mother @danhockenmaier
