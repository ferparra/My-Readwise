	- 2/ Roblox calls itself the “ultimate virtual universe" 🌌
	  
	  With 214 million MAU, it's more like the "YouTube of 3D" — an ecosystem where millions can build, play, share & monetize their own 3D creations 🌎
	  
	  Just like short-form democratized video, AI is poised to do it for 3D 🌐

	- 3/ Roblox is built on a proprietary 3D engine, so no Unity/Epic dependency 😉
	  
	  And they've continually improved it to support greater realism
	  
	  So it's no longer just cartoon worlds — you can legit make a photorealistic FPS game in Roblox.
	  
	  🤯 Mind blown:

	- 4/ From gleaming metal swords to altering sports car appearances, Roblox's new AI tools lets users modify objects and behaviors with ease.
	  
	  This co-pilot experience will redefine how games are created and played 🚗⚔️ https://t.co/pZGLHVuT8p ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bilawalsidhu/status/1644818025328308224))
	- 5/ AI Texture Generator is wild. You can use it to make a new texture, then turn it into a realistic material.
	  
	  Typically making PBR shaders involved using a complex "pro" tool like Adobe Substance — and now it's one click!

	- 6/ "Everyone becomes a creator" with Roblox's vision to embed AI directly into experiences 🪄
	  
	  So users can customize their avatars, design clothing, or generate their own music without leaving a game.
	  
	  Gone are the days of build-a-bear customization — this is next level stuff: https://t.co/lF1HxBNIsB ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bilawalsidhu/status/1644818157012684800))
	- 7/ Coding is hard, and coding for 3D is even harder.
	  
	  👩‍💻 Conveniently, Roblox now has is AI-based code assist.
	  
	  🚀 Type natural prompts and have it automagically converted into Lua, the language of choice for Roblox.
	  
	  Infusing interactivity into 3D becomes far easier... https://t.co/xKTIiar4IL ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bilawalsidhu/status/1644818241464967168))
	- 8/ Want to embellish your world with a rain particle system, realistic splashes and atmospheric mist?
	  
	  A few comments become complete blocks of code — like magic! 🪄
	  
	  ✨The 10x multiplier applies. Beginners can learn to code and experienced developers can become more ambitious: https://t.co/ykSNY007nI ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bilawalsidhu/status/1644818307227488256))
	- 9/ Wondering if Roblox scraped private code repositories to power code completion?
	  
	  😌 The answer is no: "The model is trained on no private developer data and only uses public marketplace assets"

	- 10/ Finding 3D assets to fit your description is hard.
	  
	  🔎 Roblox made  this easier with an AI search feature that'll find semantic matches for your description... even if those terms weren't included in the marketplace listing.
