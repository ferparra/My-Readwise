	- We live in an era where you can go from idea to a full-stack website with perfect SEO & performance.
	  
	  All in under 3 hours ü§Ø
	  
	  Here's the story of how I built my personal blog using @nextjs, @contentlayerdev, @tailwindcss, @TallyForms, and @vercel ‚ñ≤ https://t.co/yeZStiZsOA ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/steventey/status/1642958378032046080))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Last Friday, my thread on the Twitter algorithm blew up.
	  
	  It gained ~20M total impressions, and even got a reply from @elonmusk himself.
	  
	  I quickly realized that I needed to turn the thread into a blog post for posterity & SEO.

	- For the framework, I chose @nextjs.
	  
	  Next 13's App Router comes with a lot of built in features that guarantees performance.
	  
	  Using tools like next/image, next/font, & server components, I was able to achieve A+ perf, without having to worry about scale.

	- Next.js' new Metadata API was also a gamechanger when it comes to acing the SEO game.
	  
	  The results?
	  
	  #5 ranking on Google for "how the twitter algorithm works 2023" within a day.

	- For the UI, I chose @tailwindcss.
	  
	  I didn't have time to design an entire site from scratch, so I bought @tailwindui and used the Spotlight template as a starting point.
	  
	  Huge shoutout to @leeerob's fantastic open-source repo that uses a similar stack.

	- @contentlayerdev was a godsend when it comes to writing blog posts with Markdown/MDX.
	  
	  The best part? Hot Module Replacement (HMR) üòç
	  
	  On each save, changes are compiled & reflected in the UI instantaneously ü§Ø https://t.co/GNlfHzrAVn ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/steventey/status/1642958447120646144))
	- I also needed a form to collect emails for my newsletter, but didn't want to set up a database just to do that.
	  
	  With @TallyForms, I was able to whip up a beautiful newsletter signup component at the bottom of my blog post in less than 2 mins üëá

	- Final step: Deploy to @vercel ‚ñ≤
	  
	  Vercel's GitHub integration made things incredibly easy. With a simple git push, I was able to publish any changes in less than 20s.
	  
	  Bonus: Vercel Analytics gave me a 30,000-ft view into how the post is performing in real time ü§©

	- Here's the final blog post for those of you who are curious ‚Üí https://t.co/eUevvsrN6N
	  
	  I also posted it as a follow up on the thread, and it's been shared hundreds of times on Twitter ‚Üí https://t.co/8SDYtPWXPg

	- Caveat: This approach requires coding, but it also gives you full control of your site's design, performance & SEO.
	  
	  If you want a no-code option, I highly recommend @Super_, which is a Notion website builder that has fantastic performance as well.
