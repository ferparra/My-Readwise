	- Who you surround yourself with is who you become.

	- Step 1: grab 2 sheets of paper and a pen/pencil/sharpie

	- Step 2: on first sheet, make a list of your 10-20 closest personal connections
	  
	  For me, this includes:
	- Step 3: on same sheet, make a list of your role models
	- Step 4: on same sheet, make a list of your communities
	- Step 5: on same sheet make a list of your content sources
	- ðŸš¨ INTERMISSION ðŸš¨
	  
	  Stand up, stretch, crack your knuckles. 
	  
	  What you've done is outlined your current circle. 
	  
	  All of the inputs in your life that have an outsized impact on who you will become. 
	  
	  Okay, back to it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1403038354216820736))
	- Step 7: on same sheet, connect your name to values that you want to embody in life
	- Step 8: take all items from sheet 1 and connect them to the most relevant values in sheet 2 
	  
	  Austin -> discipline
	  Mom -> service 
	  Jay -> empathy
	  Sahil -> curiosity https://t.co/cfPV8WAVOI ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1403038466997379079))
	- Step 9: find holes in your circle
	  
	  This is when the fun starts & when things become eye-opening. 
	  
	  This is when you audit & optimize who you surround yourself with. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1403038469094526992))
	- 1) First, take note of the things that you couldnâ€™t assign to a value.
	  
	  If it's family, maybe you're so close to them it's hard to separate values. 
	  
	  Or may they don't embody any, but that's okay, because family trumps utility. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1403038470101143558))
	- If it's something like content, adding/removing is lower friction. 
	  
	  Perhaps you become ruthless about only consuming content that supports one of your values. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1403038471674118145))
	- 2) Second, take note of values that are bare. 
	  
	  For me: 
	  
	  Curiosity/empathy were less occupied than service/discipline. 
	  
	  I now think about what I can do to introduce things that embody those values. 
	  
	  Example: create a Twitter list of the 20 most curious people I follow ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1403038472663883776))
	- Think about how important this exercise is. 
	  
	  For the entirety of your career & life you'll have goals that map back to values. 
	  
	  One of the fastest ways to become your values is surround yourself with the right things. 
	  
	  This is the playbook to do that. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1403038474014531586))
