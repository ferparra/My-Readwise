document_note:: Paolo Belardi's book "Why Architects Still Draw" discusses various conditions and situations that can inspire extraordinary ideas, such as intuition, mental feedback circuits, deduction, induction, and abduction. He also examines Graham Wallas' 1926 theory of the creative process and the importance of fortuitous circumstances, boredom, oversights, habit, necessity, and serendipity. He also mentions famous examples of ideas arising from dreams and unconscious foresight, such as Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin and Kekulé's breakthrough in chemistry. In conclusion, Belardi suggests that ideas are in the air, and that fortune favors the prepared and passionate mind.

	- **Ideas arise from serendipity**, when looking for something completely different. The accidental discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming is a classic example of serendipity, but another one that shows how important it is to interpret something correctly is provided by the American astronomer James Christy. In 1978 Christy was observing Pluto’s orbit, using a “star scanner” into which he could insert a planet’s picture to measure it. He saw that in the image he had chosen, Pluto seemed to be squished, though with a definite protuberance. He attributed this fact to the low-quality picture and decided to change it. Fate intervened, however. The scanner jammed and Christy needed the help of a technician, who took two hours to fix the instrument. During this time, Christy’s eyes came to see the deformation differently, and that photo, which he had first chalked up to error, became an obsession. While waiting for the technician, the astronomer looked through the photographic archives on Pluto and found an example marked “Pluto image elongated.” Flipping through the years between 1965 and 1970, he found six other similar pictures, confirming his intuition: The photo was correct and showed something that nobody had ever noticed before. The elongations were because Pluto had a moon, Charon. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9jsdqy8w65v3dq0qp16r4s))
		- **Note**: James Christy was an American astronomer looking at pictures of Pluto. He noticed that the picture he had chosen looked a bit squished, but he thought it was because the picture was low quality. He wanted to change it, but the machine he was using got stuck and he had to wait for someone to fix it. While he was waiting, James looked at other pictures of Pluto and found one that said "Pluto image elongated". He flipped through more pictures from 1965 to 1970 and saw six more that looked the same. He realized that the squished picture he had was actually correct, and that Pluto had a moon called Charon! This was a very lucky discovery because nobody had noticed it before.
