		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1. Tinder
	  
	  Tinder tripled its user base from 5k users to 15k users in a blink of an eye.
	  
	  To make it happen, they would go to sororities and get the girls to install the app.
	  
	  Then, they'd go to the bothering frat and get them to sign up after they saw their friends on Tinder. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1390469624601485314))
	- This is how @WhitWolfeHerd got the first 15k users on Tinder.
	  
	  Hustlin' on her own campus and planting the seed for growth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1390469625641590786))
	- 2. Zapier 
	  
	  Zapier is an integration software that binds together different tools.
	  
	  Ex: Wix -> Mailchimp
	  
	  The goal was to create an authority on search.
	  
	  Plus, to create a new audience.
	  
	  To drive growth, they created a guide like blog. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1390469626576969731))
	- Imagine a guide with hundreds of "How To" content for specific tools.
	  
	  For example: How to use LinkedIn Search
	  
	  This made Zapier a content destination for content related to different tools within Zapier's ecosystem.
	  
	  The result?
	  
	  From 0 to 600k readers in 3 years. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1390469627608764422))
	- 3. LinkedIn 
	  
	  LinkedIn had a hard time initially getting users to use LinkedIn.
	  
	  So, they implemented what they called a "Reconnect Flow."
	  
	  After a new user was onboarded, LinkedIn asked you one question: "Where did you used to work?" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1390469628669857797))
	- Based on your answer, LinkedIn would show you a list of possible connections from your previous job.
	  
	  Easy way to use your onboarding process to generate user momentum.
	  
	  LinkedIn's page views increased by 41%.
	  
	  Searches by 33%. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1390469629676605446))
	- 4. Facebook
	  
	  FB didn't always have 2B+ users.
	  
	  One of FB's keys for early growth was determining their north star metric.
	  
	  They learned that the clearest indicator of retention was if a user connected with 7 friends within 10 days.
	  
	  If they didn't -- they left the app. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1390469630687334402))
	- Because of this data, FB created an onboarding experience that focused on their North Star Metric. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1390469631727505412))
	- 5. PayPal
	  
	  PayPal had the OG growth-oriented referral program.
	  
	  Because buying things online was so new -- PayPal gave away $20 to users who signed up.
	  
	  If you referred someone -- they got $20. And so did you.
	  
	  Giving away free money works.
	  
	  PayPal grew to 5M users in months. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1390469632646131712))
	- The takeaway here?
	  
	  2-sided referral programs work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1390469633623396355))
	- 6. Airbnb 
	  
	  Early on, Airbnb knew their target audience was on Craigslist looking for places to stay.
	  
	  So, they created an API integration that allowed users to post their Airbnb ad on Craigslist and Airbnb at the same time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1390469634529402883))
	- Now, a user's Airbnb listing is on a platform with MILLIONS of users.
	  
	  This growth hack generated massive awareness for Airbnb early on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1390469635519225856))
	- 7. Twitter
	  
	  In 2010, growth was slowing down for Twitter.
	  
	  To change this, they optimized their onboarding experience to create a higher network effect.
	  
	  When a user would sign up -- they would immediately suggest 10 accounts for a user to follow. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1390469636462948352))
	- This quickly puts content in a user's feed. 
	  
	  Users quickly understood the value of Twitter. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1390469637444411396))
	- That's it for now...
