	  "Instead of trying to turn GPT into an agent, we can... design human-in-the-loop systems which enhance a human‚Äôs abilities without outsourcing their agency to a machine"
	  
	  Many key ideas here including 
	  üë§ Simulacra
	  üêù Hive Minds, and 
	  üß†Neocortex Prostheses:

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1. LLMs can be used to generate simulacra, or simulations of specific personas
	  
	  We've only begun to scratch the surface here. Worth watching @character_ai @AnthropicAI @KevinAFischer 
	  
	  An example of persona simulation: https://t.co/IeqBfOqD45

	- 2. Rather than seeing AI as an agent or oracle, we can view it through the lens of cyborgism
	  
	  A cyborg is an extension of self with human agency at its center. This differs from a distinct & goal-oriented agent, or an oracle which answers questions without taking action

	- 3. LLMs enable 'de facto' neocortex prostheses and hive minds
	  
	  Interfaces with sufficiently high I/O bandwidth will allow us to overcome the barrier between internal thought & external communication. AI, AR, and neurotechnology will be critical in achieving this

	- I don't agree with all the ideas here (e.g. perspective on RLHF). And we may want to coexist with AI in multiple capacities, including but not limited to cyborgism. But excited to see more discussions like this!
