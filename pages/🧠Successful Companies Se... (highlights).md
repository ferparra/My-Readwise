	- 🧠Successful companies see data as a strategic lever for growth, not just a team or set of tools. This requires a maturity shift from being Data Informed ➡️ Data Led. 
	  My roadmap lays out the capabilities and stages required to do this: https://t.co/k0thp7VLP4 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/crystalwidjaja/status/1384937697035292673))

	- There are 3 stages of data maturity: Data Informed, Data Driven, and Data Led.
	  
	  At each stage, you're evolving 4 key capabilities: Infrastructure ⚙️, analytics 📈, operations 💪, and team 👩‍🔬. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/crystalwidjaja/status/1384937698226548737))
	- Data Informed companies effectively catalogue, organize, and store their data for operational visibility. 
	  Think: Data dictionaries, transactional databases, KPI dashboards... the simple things that most companies get wrong! 🤷‍♀️ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/crystalwidjaja/status/1384937699417759744))
	- 🎓 Data Driven companies graduate from being Data Informed when they are actively using data to optimize for specific users, behaviors, and experiences in the product at the feature-level — not just observing data as an output, but as an INPUT to their strategies.

	- 🪄My final stage is Data Led: companies that cannot operationally function without data products. That means every team, not just the data org, has to be able to unlock, create, and "productize" data products for their own features, products, and services 🔓 Now we're scaling 😎 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/crystalwidjaja/status/1384937701812719616))
