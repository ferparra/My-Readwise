document_note:: In Atomic Habits, James Clear seeks to create an actionable operating manual for how to improve habits and, by result, life. He describes the four phases of a habit, cue, craving, response and reward, and emphasizes the importance of focusing on trajectory over results. He discusses the importance of environment, proximity and repetition in forming good habits, as well as providing practical techniques such as the 2 minute rule, habit stacking and tracking, and habit contracts and accountability partners. Clear also encourages readers to take their interests and proclivities into account, and warns against letting habits become too entrenched in one's identity.

		- **Note**: The book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear outlines a five-step process for building good habits and breaking bad ones. This process involves making the cue obvious, making the craving attractive, making the response easy, and making the reward satisfying. Additionally, the inverse of this process can be used to stop doing things, such as making it non-obvious, unattractive, hard, and painful.
	- **Motivation is overrated. Environment often matters more**. Design your environment to be productive and have visual cues to trigger healthy habits. Do your best to design it to also avoid any negative temptations

		- **Note**: Our environment often has a bigger impact on our behavior than our motivation. To make it easier to do healthy habits, design your environment to help you be productive, and have things around you to remind you of what you want to do. Also try to make sure your environment does not contain things that might tempt you to make bad choices. It is also helpful to be around people who are doing the things you want to do, since it is easier to copy and be like them.
