	- 1/ ICYMI @FoundationbyBB is funding passion projects & I'm running a program designed to help the recipients deliver their passion projects. I thought I'd share a bit about the program in case it's helpful to anyone thinking of doing something similar.

	- 2/ The program is three months long. There are three stages to it. In Stage 1, we set goals, design a Build in Public strategy, and get to know each other. This part is all about setting the tone, establishing a framework, and building trust. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joelconnolly/status/1445606245642108933))
	- 3/ In Stage 2, we are focusing on inspiration and ambition raising. Each week, we get together and interview an inspirational creative who has successfully made a career of their passions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joelconnolly/status/1445606247558836225))
	- 4/ In Stage 3, we prepare for our demo day. I'm building this program as we go and, full disclosure, I don't yet know what the demo day will look like ðŸ¥¸ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joelconnolly/status/1445606249421152260))
	- 5/ Most weeks see us catching up for a zoom call and "building in public". Each week, we share parts of our journey on the internet. We share those posts with the group, hoping that everyone will jump in, like, share, comment etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joelconnolly/status/1445606251358871559))
	- 6/ I'm running everything from Notion, and here is what our Homebase looks like. We have the front page with an index and a list of our passion projects.

	- 9/ And my favourite section - our Shared Notebook: most weeks participants have light homework - they publish it here, as well as any learnings or links to social posts they have made. The intention is that this will be a source of learning and reflection down the track.

	- 10/ We chat on Geneva - it's like Discord or Slack but more friendly. I chose it because it's more fun, I am working with students & I wasn't sure if they would be all across Slack. Geneva is good, but it's a very young product, and things like integrations aren't a feature yet.

	- 11/ Biggest lesson so far: everyone is on different time schedules, and I've learned to accept that my protostars will jump in and out when they can. Some weeks they will participate. Other weeks life gets in the way. This might be my day job, but it isn't theirs! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joelconnolly/status/1445606282761682961))
	- 12/ This is a blog post, too - for more detail, jump on over and dive in. Follow me to learn with me as I build this thing ðŸ¥°
