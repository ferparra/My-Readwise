	- Just finished The Trouble with Fusion (1983) by Lawrence Lidsky of MIT.

	  My takeaways about fusion energy:
	  
	  1. Fusing nuclei in plasma requires forcing charged particles into each other, so smaller nuclei require less energy input to fuse ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tlehmanifold/status/1485855444203573248))

	- 2. Heat transfer is easier with fission. Move the rods around to change heat transfer surface. In fusion, the heat transfer surface is inaccessible and fixed, needs lots of coolant. Also the radius needs to be >3m for ignition, but that pushes up the heat transfer rate even more

	- 3. Small accidents in fusion reactors will be more common, and maintenance is really hard. Fine for government labs with big budgets and no need to deliver utilities, but the higher complexity and lower reliability of fusion reactors is built in ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tlehmanifold/status/1485855469696475137))
	- 4. For equal heat transfer rates, the inner wall protecting the fusion reaction will have 10x more neutron flux than fission. Also the neutrons will be 15-30x more energetic, so the neutron damage is 150-300x worse than fission. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tlehmanifold/status/1485855470514360321))
	- 5. Multiple juxtaposed extreme temperatures lead to inherently more complex machinery. The fusion reaction will be 150,000,000C, and the plasma will be contained by using superconducting magnets to produce the right magnetic field. The superconductors need to be near absolute 0 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tlehmanifold/status/1485855472821288961))
	- 6. Fission doesn't risk nuclear weapons proliferation, but fusion does. Fission just breaks down existing atoms, but fusion ejects really high energy neutrons. An evil fusion reactor operator can take natural uranium and put it into the blanket and make it weapons-grade easily ðŸ’£ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tlehmanifold/status/1485855473777528833))
	- 7. Fusion definitely has some benefits, but the new ability to extract uranium from seawater has removed the seawater/Deuterium benefit. The only thing left is waste. Fission waste is worse, but we already have a system for storing it. Fusion still doesn't even work on earth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tlehmanifold/status/1485855474612277249))
	- Overall, I am hopeful that many of the engineering challenges will be solved, given that private companies are in this space now. I am so ready to see what they come up with. But the sheer complexity of it all should really make us take a closer look at fission. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tlehmanifold/status/1485855475421773825))
	- Fission is literally a bunch of rods put close to each other and they glow warm. It's worked since the 1950s and the energy density is absolutely off the charts. We should keep chasing the fusion dragon, but also be realistic about how hard this will be ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tlehmanifold/status/1485855477133201411))
