	- * Incredible paper. LLMs-generated text can be detected by embedding signals that are invisible to humans but algorithmically detectable.
	  
	  It's a watermarking framework for your language models.
	  Reaches 99% confidence on 23 words.

	- Generative AI comes to User Interface design!
	  
	  @Galileo_AI is the first AI product trained on thousands of outstanding designs. It can turn a simple text description into high-fidelity editable UI designs.

	- Google just released Vid2Seq!
	  
	  It's a pretrained visual language model that can understand and describe multi-event videos.
	  
	  The team augmented a LM with time tokens to predict event boundaries and textual descriptions in the same output sequence.

	- Game changer. You can now run GPT locally on your macbook with GPT4All, a new 7B LLM based on LLaMa.
	  
	  It's completely open source:  demo, data and code to train an assistant-style large language model with ~800k GPT-3.5-Turbo Generations based on LLaMa

	- OpenAI just released the implementation/weights of their Consistency Models, a strong contender to Diffusion Models!
	  
	  Consistency models do not require adversarial training, which makes them easier to train and less prone to mode collapse. 
	  
	  They also allow for few-step samplingâ€¦
