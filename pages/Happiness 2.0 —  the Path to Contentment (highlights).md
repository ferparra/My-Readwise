	  We found that people who are very intent on being happy, those same people somewhat ironically in general have lower levels of well-being, higher levels of depressive symptoms, and paradoxically lower levels of overall happiness. So it seems that the more perhaps the more intent they are on being happy the less they actually manage to be happy.

	  One domain of research where this has been examined is in the research of flow. And this is researched by Michali Tixantimali. He and colleagues have shown that when people are in a state of flow they report later on being incredibly happy. So it's a state of deep happiness but what's important is that it's also characterized by being completely unaware of the self. So it means that the self almost feels like it's dissolved during these states of flow and in fact it's interrupted and destroyed when you check in with yourself and ask how am I feeling now.
