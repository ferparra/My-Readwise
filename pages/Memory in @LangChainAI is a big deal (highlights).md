document_note:: Memory plays a significant role in @LangChainAI. The different types of memory include ConversationBufferMemory, ConversationBufferWindowMemory, ConversationSummaryMemory, and VectorStore-Backed Memory. Each memory type has its benefits, such as storing messages, keeping memory history small, creating conversation summaries, and storing memories in a VectorDB. Memory can be added to a chain, agent, or even multi-input chain to improve AI's ability to remember relevant information. Further demo projects with memory will be made in the coming weeks.
