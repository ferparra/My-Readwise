	- TRADERS LORE: life is about the increment.
	  When one takes a hit, suffers a personal/collective setback, must not look back. Losers look back.
	  Look ONLY ahead &, when back in the saddle, you'll get encouraged, even thrilled by the slope/improvement (1st derivative).
	  Stock vs Flow.

	- Explain to me why we should spent taxpayer money to bailout companies (airlines) who spent their cash buying their own stock so the CEO gets optionality, instead of having a crisis buffer.
	  
	  We should bail out individuals based on needs, not corporations.

	- Principles do not need to make sense locally. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1444538499470856192))
	- REMOTE WORK IS HERE TO STAY
	  Rory is explaining how, if 9 persons can make it to a physical meeting, and a single one can't, high probability the meeting will be on Zoom.
	  My example: In a meeting in Germany with 9 german speakers +1 nonTeutonic, the meeting will be in English. https://t.co/gdllQdkRLk ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1382317716435046401))
	- EDUCATION.
	  Distilling the conversation with @bryan_caplan hosted by @tylercowen 
	  1) There has been a traditional separation between:
	    + "liberal education" for free men, (liber), who didn't work for a living, & 
	     +"technical education", for those who labor. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/989481241337614336))

	- NUDGE SINISTER: How Behavioral Economics is Dangerous Verbalism.
	  A project that will end up putting Nudgevillain @R_Thaler in his place.

	- How you *will* eventually go bust on a fair bet: Explaining the Kelly/Shannon/Thorp result & beyond.
	  
	  (& why nudgeboy Richard Thaler @R_Thaler has a serious, serious problem, aside from his other mistakes ).

	- History, like all random processes, seen backwards is smoother and way lower in entropy than when lived forward. And we tend to forget it.

	- Aleppo, the longest lasting sophistication throughout history --wealthier than most of Europe ~1800.
	  An archetypical trading city-state swallowed & destroyed by a centralized "modern" identity-driven nation-state.
	  Lost its Jews in the 40s-60s, its Christian/Armenians recently.

	- Russia & Energy:
	  You can't squeeze the same pple more than once per lifetime.
	  
	  There are things called: 
	  SUBSTITUTION
	  ADAPTATION (smaller cars, electric bicycles)
	  MIGRATION (factories closer to energy)
	  IRREVERSIBILITY
	  
	  I've never seen a squeeze not followed by a glut. Never. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1567595014036897792))
	- Those who were relying on correlation bonds-equity for "diversification" before the recent bond collapse were also warned:
	  
	   "Pension Funds Should Never Rely on Correlation", Nov 2021.

	- Cities are living organisms. Like all organisms they are indivisible and mutate over time. Some cities are more alive than others. You can only "feel" a city by flaneuring, walking slowly (very slowly) without any predetermined goal.
