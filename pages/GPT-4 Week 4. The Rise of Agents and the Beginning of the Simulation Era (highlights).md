	- Stanford/Google researchers basically created a mini westworld. They simulated a game society with agents that were able to have memories, relationships and make reflections. When they analysed the behaviour, they measured to be ‚Äòmore human‚Äô than actual humans. Absolutely wild shit. The architecture is so simple too. I wrote about this in my newsletter yday and man the applications and use cases for this in like gaming or VR and basically creating virtual worlds is going to be insane (nsfw use cases are scary to even think about). Someone said they cant wait to add capitalism and a sense of eventual death or finite time and.. that would be very interesting to see.
