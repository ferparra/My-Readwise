	- There are two families of finite groups which are widely used in modern cryptography:
	  multiplicative groups and elliptic curves
	- Function:
	  A function maps inputs from one set
	  to outputs in the same or some other set.
	- One-way:
	  Computing the output AAA from the input aaa is efficient,
	  whereas finding an input aaa which maps to a given output AAA is
	  computationally infeasible.
	- Linear:
	  We restrict the input of our function to integers (the whole numbers)
	  and require that there exists some operation ∘\circ∘
	  so that f(a+b)=f(a)∘f(b)f(a + b) = f(a) \circ f(b)f(a+b)=f(a)∘f(b).
