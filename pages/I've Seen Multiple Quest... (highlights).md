	- I've seen multiple questions about how to build a Chatbot that:
	  
	  â€¢ Retrieves data from PDFs and
	  â€¢ Has conversational memory
	  
	  Turns out, it's really simple to do with @LangChainAI. 
	  
	  So, I wrote a quick tutorial with a real-world example for you all.
	  
	  Code below. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/virattt/status/1644329667673878528))

	- 1/4

	- 2/4
	  
	  Prompt: "What was it two years before that?"
	  
	  Response: "Airbnb's net income in 2020 was -$4.6 billion."
	  
	  Nice.
	  
	  It figured out that I want to know what net income was two years before 2022. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/virattt/status/1644329669720694784))
	- 3/4
	  
	  Prompt: "When did they IPO?"
	  
	  Response: "Airbnb went public on December 14, 2020." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/virattt/status/1644329670727311360))
	- 4/4
	  
	  Prompt: "How many shares were issued?"
	  
	  Response: "55,000,000 shares were issued when Airbnb went public."
	  
	  It retained the context of Airbnb and the IPO. 
	  
	  Super cool. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/virattt/status/1644329671591378945))

	  I'm not using @OpenAI's GPT-4 for this, but an older model.
	  
	  Please let me know if you have any feedback!
	  
	  My goal is to make learning about LLMs as accessible as possible for everyone ðŸ™‚ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/virattt/status/1644329672614850562))
