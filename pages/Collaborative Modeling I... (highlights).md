	- Collaborative modeling is key to ensuring the success of software development projects. But who exactly are the relevant stakeholders in this process?
	  
	  In collaborative modeling, there are 4 categories of stakeholders: domain experts, customers, users, and the development team.

	- The development team builds software to solve business problems, and they should have software engineers who take ownership of the software they make and gain a shared understanding of the domain. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kenny_baas/status/1623679831530430466))
	- This understanding is obtained from domain experts, who understand or are experiencing the business problems. Customers are the stakeholders who purchase the company's product or service, while users are the ones who use the software system created by the development team.

	- It's important to note that there are a few common misconceptions about these categories. For example, domain experts are not always users, and customer is not a synonym for the user. Additionally, the development team is not a customer, user, or domain expert. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kenny_baas/status/1623679836437811200))
	- By understanding these categories, you can better collaborate with all relevant stakeholders in your software development projects. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kenny_baas/status/1623679839315042305))
