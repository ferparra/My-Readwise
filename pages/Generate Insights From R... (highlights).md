	- From the moment research begins and as time starts to pass, speed matters. With the passage of time, the greater the risk that:
	  
	  ⏰ insights become less timely & relevant
	  🤦🏻‍♀️decisions are made without research
	  🥗freshness of observations fades
	  🥀user needs & preferences change ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/notablyai/status/1623803300276568064))

	- In our experience testing this feature with real research data we:
	  
	  💡generated insights similar & as good as human researchers
	  
	  💥found new perspectives that weren't considered
	  
	  ✏️ identified errors & bias from analysis
	  
	  🏆 felt rewarded & validated for our research efforts

	- At best these AI-generated insights uncover new and rich observations or patterns you would have missed.
	  
	  And at worst they're a fast and fun way to break the ice and overcome the daunting task of crafting an insight from scratch... a way to get started and not feel so alone. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/notablyai/status/1623803307457232899))
	- We're inspired by the speed and accuracy in our tests so far and are excited to release this update into the wild.
	  
	  We'll be dialing in a few things and paying close attention to feedback. Can't wait to see what you all come up with! Happy learning, friends.❤️✌️ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/notablyai/status/1623803309600518149))
