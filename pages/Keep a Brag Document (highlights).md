	- By recording your small wins and accomplishments on a weekly basis, you accumulate concrete evidence of what you’ve achieved.
	- But the biggest benefit of a brag document lies in identifying what you enjoy doing.
	- Your wins are likely a representation of tasks you enjoyed. And you should be very proactive about focusing on those tasks going forward.
	- The biggest benefit of this is that it forces you to scrutinize your output on a regular basis and allows you to be proactive about focusing on the work you want to do.
	- If your manager ever needs to vouch for you internally, then boom - they have direct evidence they can use. If your manager needs to reshuffle workload, then they know what you’re good at and what you can improve on.
