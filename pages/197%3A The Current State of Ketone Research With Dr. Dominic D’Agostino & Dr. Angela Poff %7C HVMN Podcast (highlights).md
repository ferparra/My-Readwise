document_note:: In this podcast episode of HVMN, Dominic D'Agostino and Angela Poff discuss the current state of ketone research and its various applications. They discuss how ketones have the power to put health back into people's hands, and how the ketogenic diet is being explored for cancer, psychiatry, and chronic disease. They also talk about the role of ketones in athletic performance, how ketones can be used to increase adaptation to performance stimulus, and how ketones improve brain energy signaling metabolism and resilience. They recommend a Mediterranean diet with exogenous ketones for supplementation with about 50-100g carbohydrates, and suggest that keeping ketones around 1.5 mmol is usually a sweet spot with how one feels and real world benefit. Finally, they discuss the future of ketone research and how dietary and metabolic based therapies might be used for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's/dementia, cancer, and psychiatry.
