	- Three Yearn strategies using ETH-C, WBTC-A and YFI-A MakerDAO Vaults have held strongly during the dip and none of them has experienced liquidations.
	  
	  They can use much tighter ratio and adjust for the future effective price thanks to Yearn being whitelisted on MakerDAO oracle.

	- Performance of Uniswap V3 liquidity managers compared to a synthetic Uniswap V2 position which earns zero fees. This is the same approach Curve uses to measure profit.
	  
	  All of the active liquidity managers have shown worse performance than simple holding.

	- The solution to Metamask phishing is very simple.
	  
	  It's generative art.
	  
	  When a user sets the extension up, they choose from a few generated themes (accent colors, shapes, patterns) which stay unique for that user. A phishing window won't be able to replicate those.

	- This mad scientist literally wrote an academic article to disprove my tweet. Amazing new insights about gmTWAP manipulation costs and a good case for protocol-owned liquidity if you plan to rely on this type of oracles. https://t.co/lIVfGZNL46 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1459318577086046211))
	- sorry but if 96% people quit when offered a 3mo severance, it means you’ve hired mercenaries in the first place. mercenaries can solve a task but they won’t make a coherent product. for this you need everyone to have a good culture and live and breathe the idea. https://t.co/SF77uc0r7X ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1593670346049310726))
