	- A quick thread on the dangers of OKRs, performance reviews, and pedantry that can happen if we lose sight of what a performance review is supposed to be doing.
	  
	  Story time! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1233418203742658560))

	- I know an amazing engineer that used to work on a Developer Relations team at a great big fancy company.
	  
	  DevRel helps external developers use this company's APIs. They create tutorials, sample code, training materials, and suggest documentation changes. üëçüèø https://t.co/1Ia9jtaM8V ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1233418966044794880))
	- But how do you measure the effectiveness of a DevRel organization? How do you measure its impact?
	  
	  Maybe there should be metrics about how many pieces of content are produced, or how much engagement there is with that content?
	  
	  All very reasonable so far! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1233419610558365701))
	- And each individual DevRel engineer should know how their daily work contributes to the overall goal? So maybe each engineer has a personal OKR to produce X pieces of content reaching Y developers... 
	  
	  OK, this is starting to feel weird, but I'm still OK with it? I think... ü§î ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1233420106882928640))
	- Now let's get back to our great engineer!
	  
	  He was assigned to write tutorials on how to use a troublesome API that was generating lots of user confusion, causing lots of bugs, and support tickets. Measurable *customer pain.* ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1233420583821398018))
	- This engineer looked at the API, and said, "The customers are right! This thing is confusing!" And so instead of writing tutorials, he went and talked to the team that owned the API *gasp!*
	  
	  He left his pre-ordained path! https://t.co/KvrJOMMeMU ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1233421524788367361))
	- üë©üèª"Yeah we know that API is janky. But it's always below the priority cut line.‚òπÔ∏è"
	  
	  üë®üèº"I get that. But I know how to build APIs too and I know how this API should look! Can I help?"
	  
	  üë©üèª"Great idea! Go team! As One(tm)!"
	  
	  With their approval, he submitted code to improve the API! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1233425479652110336))
	- Customer pain, as measured by support tickets, forum questions, etc, went down! Yay!
	  
	  But... He never did write that tutorial for the old, broken API. Which brings us back to performance reviews and OKRs... üòÆ
	  
	  Admit it. You knew where this was going, didn't you? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1233425974001201152))
	- Before I tell you what did happen, ask yourself what *should* happen?
	  
	  Understand that there are no good people or bad people in this story. Only behaviors and outcomes.
	  
	  The culture of a place is the set of behaviors that are rewarded or punished. Nothing more. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1233426605545902080))
	- Should the DevRel engineer be encouraged or discouraged from this type of initiative and behavior?
	  
	  Should the DevRel org be rewarded for innovating on behalf of the customer? Or punished for missing an OKR, exceeding their mandate, and writing the wrong type of code? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1233427034283495426))
	- What is the purpose of an OKR?
	  
	  What is the purpose of a performance management system? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1233427196829560833))
	- OK, the conclusion for those of you beautiful souls who aren't so cynical that you already know what happened. Don't ever change! ‚ô•Ô∏è
	  
	  Our engineer was not rewarded for his initiative.üòÆ
	  
	  He made compelling arguments about it "Being a bad OKR," and "Solving the right problem." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1233556376577662976))
	- After accepting his feedback about "Things he could do to be more successful," he had 2 questions:
	  
	  1. The core job of the team that I fixed the API for, is "build the product." But are *they* allowed to write tutorials and give presentations *as needed?*
	  
	  2. Are they hiring? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1233558236961206273))
	- He switched teams! He's much happier now. ü§ó
	  
	  Before you think that's a happy ending...
	  
	  Think about what this means for the culture of both teams, and of the company.
	  
	  What if he had stayed on DevRel, and decided to optimize for his career instead (not fix APIs anymore)? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1233559941425680384))
