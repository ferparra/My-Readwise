document_note:: The Heath brothers suggest a systematic way of making decisions by influencing the Rider, Elephant and shaping the Path. They emphasize that what looks like a people problem is often a situation problem, needing to engage people's hearts and minds, and directing the Rider, motivating the Elephant, and shaping the Path in order to spark movement in a new direction. They suggest making the change small enough to reach people's immediate goals, and providing crystal-clear direction, as well as a long-term goal with short-term critical moves to motivate action. To join a global tribe of lifelong learners, and make the ideas from these books actionable, they recommend The Latticework.

	- **If you want people to change, you must provide crystal-clear direction. What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity. In short, to make a switch, you need to script the critical moves.** This is what we mean by ‚Äúscripting‚Äù the critical moves. Change begins at the level of individual decisions and behaviors, but that‚Äôs a hard place to start because that‚Äôs where the friction is. Inertia and decision paralysis will conspire to keep people doing things the old way. To spark movement in a new direction, you need to provide crystal-clear guidance. That‚Äôs why scripting is important‚Äîyou‚Äôve got to think about the specific behavior that you‚Äôd want to see in a tough moment, whether the tough moment takes place in a Brazilian railroad system or late at night in your own snack-loaded pantry.

	- **To change behavior, you‚Äôve got to direct the Rider, motivate the Elephant, and shape the Path**. If you can do all three at once, dramatic change can happen even if you don‚Äôt have lots of power or resources behind you.

	- You are simply asking yourself, **‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs working and how can we do more of it?‚Äù** That‚Äôs the bright-spot philosophy in a single question. You can also ask, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs broken, and how do we fix it?‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1c4wc910r0t4j3ca8vk07x))
	- What is essential, though, is to marry your long-term goal with short-term critical moves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1c51h2zev9tnppa4kh5k1w))
	- Kotter and Cohen observed that, in almost all successful change efforts, the sequence of change is not ANALYZE-THINK-CHANGE, but rather SEE-FEEL-CHANGE. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1c55k0kekpddpawcek4mv0))
