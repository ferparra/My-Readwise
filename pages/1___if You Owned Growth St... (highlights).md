	- 1/If you owned growth stocks this year - like we did at Altimeter - you got your face ripped off.  As a hedge fund we expect to lose less than the indexes on the way down - this year we have lost more.  Our Big 4 - Snow, Meta, MSFT, and Uber are all down big.  #keepingitreal ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/altcap/status/1524731074928320513))

	- 2/ Despite concerns about valuations - we didn’t hedge enough. We expected a gradual reversion to avg multiple as rates normalized, but we didn’t forsee a war in Ukraine or fears about hyperinflation /runaway rates.  Markets moved fast- we moved too slow. https://t.co/tuP4ZFpJ0W ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/altcap/status/1524731076744122368))
	- 3/ Stocks are now cascading lower.  Growth multiples are near 10 year lows.  And all the talk is of war, inflation, rates, and recession. We are likely already in a recession, demand is slowing, and inflation peaked in March. So what next?  Key to have an operating framework.

	- 4) Snow, Meta, MSFT and Uber will all grow FCF over the next 3 years. They don't need $$ and FCF will drive share price irrespective of the near term path of inflation / rates. Tune out the noise. And build even more edge / conviction in your key investments.  #essentialism ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/altcap/status/1524731079743066113))
	- 5/ I take no relative comfort or pleasure in the pain being experienced by other firms. This is a hard business.  But if we get the benefit of the ups, then we have to own the downs - important to lead from the front when the sh*t hits the fan.

	- 6/ Our team is fired up to help our CEOs and investment partners navigate this moment. We have great long term partners who realize - despite present pain - the world continues to arc toward technology and these moments will lead to outsized future returns. But it will take time.
