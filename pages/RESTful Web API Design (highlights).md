	- REST is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia. REST is independent of any underlying protocol and is not necessarily tied to HTTP. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpcdxmcc37zh358mdfapwnv))

	- In 2008, Leonard Richardson proposed the following [maturity model](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html) for web APIs:
	  
	  •   Level 0: Define one URI, and all operations are POST requests to this URI.
	  •   Level 1: Create separate URIs for individual resources.
	  •   Level 2: Use HTTP methods to define operations on resources.
	  •   Level 3: Use hypermedia (HATEOAS, described below). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv7je7kc7h778kxg8v0349fy))
