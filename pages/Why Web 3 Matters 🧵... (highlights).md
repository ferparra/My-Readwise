	- Why Web 3 matters ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201621266534402))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Web 1 (roughly 1990-2005) was about open protocols that were decentralized and community-governed. Most of the value accrued to the edges of the network â€” users and builders. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201622281551876))
	- Web 2 (roughly 2005-2020) was about siloed, centralized services run by corporations. Most of the value accrued to a handful of companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201623338438659))
	- We are now at the beginning of the Web 3 era, which combines the decentralized, community-governed ethos of Web 1 with the advanced, modern functionality of Web 2. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201624487759874))
	- Web 3 is the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201625590779909))
	- (Thanks to @packym for this definition.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201626610077701))
	- Why does Web 3 matter?
	  
	  First, letâ€™s look at the problems with centralized platforms. (I wrote more about this back in 2018 here https://t.co/KvyyhalCos) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201627641876482))
	- Centralized platforms follow a predictable life cycle. At first, they do everything they can to recruit users and 3rd-party complements like creators, developers, and businesses. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201628765921280))
	- They do this to strengthen their network effect. As platforms move up the adoption S-curve, their power over users and 3rd parties steadily grows.

	- When they hit the top of the S-curve, their relationships with network participants change from positive-sum to zero-sum. To continue growing requires extracting data from users and competing with (former) partners. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201634390437895))
	- Famous examples of this are Microsoft vs. Netscape, Google vs. Yelp, Facebook vs. Zynga,  Twitter vs. its 3rd-party clients, and Epic vs Apple. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201635522899968))
	- For 3rd parties, the transition from cooperation to competition feels like a bait-and-switch. Over time, the best entrepreneurs, developers, and investors have learned to not build on top of centralized platforms. This has stifled innovation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201636705734656))
	- Now letâ€™s talk about Web 3. In Web 3, ownership and control is decentralized. Users and builders can own pieces of internet services by owning tokens, both non-fungible (NFTs) and fungible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201637779480578))
	- Tokens give users property rights: the ability to own a piece of the internet. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201638895177729))
	- NFTs give users the ability to own objects, which can be art, photos, code, music, text, game objects, credentials, governance rights, access passes, and whatever else people dream up next. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201639994068997))
	- NFTs exist on top of blockchains like Ethereum. Ethereum is a decentralized global computer that is owned and operated by its users. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201641323614212))
	- Blockchains are special computers that anyone can access but no one owns. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201642338643969))
	- Ethereum is powered by a fungible token, ETH, which is used to incentivize the physical computers that underlie the system. ETH is also the systemâ€™s native currency for transactions, like NFT purchases. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201643353710595))
	- There are many ways for users to acquire fungible and non-fungible tokens. You can buy them, but there are also ways to earn them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201644431593475))
	- Uniswap famously retroactively airdropped 15% of its governance tokens to early users of the protocol. Community grants like this have become common in Web 3 as a way to build goodwill and incentivize adoption. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201645488623617))
	- You can also earn tokens through creative and entrepreneurial activities. For example, people are earning roughly $100M worth of ETH per day selling NFTs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201646646263818))
	- Tokens align network participants to work together toward a common goal â€” the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201648034549766))
	- This fixes the core problem of centralized networks, where the value is accumulated by one company, and the company ends up fighting its own users and partners. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201649066364931))
	- Before Web 3, users and builders had to choose between the limited functionality of Web 1 or the corporate, centralized model of Web 2. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201650169405443))
	- Web 3 offers a new way that combines the best aspects of the previous eras. Itâ€™s very early in this movement and a great time to get involved. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201651192872965))
