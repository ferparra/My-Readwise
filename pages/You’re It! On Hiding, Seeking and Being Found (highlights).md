document_note:: The text discusses various aspects of Zen, Buddhism, and Hinduism, emphasizing the idea that nothing can exist in isolation without its contrast, such as knowing fat without skinny or good without bad. It also covers the concepts of mysticism and morality, the game of yes and no, and the two models of the universe that have been prevalent over the last 2,000 years.

	- The game of yes and no. The philosophy of Yin and Yang is that externally yes/no, good/bad are different but internally they are one and the same. Without contrast nothing can exist - the negative is the source of the positive, the empty space in the window is what makes it useful ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj26rsp1tqb8yyagg19pdex))
	- We are consistently tricked by our thoughts which are merely symbols. Losing sight of the fact that money is merely a symbol, an abstraction to make trade more convenient has gotten more people in trouble than nearly anything else. In the pursuit for these abstractions we are destroying our physical world and relationship with others ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj273w5jjsgfx00n159hgm0))
		- **Note**: We are often fooled by our ideas, which are only symbols. Many people have made a lot of mistakes because they forgot that money is just a symbol - something that helps us buy and sell things. In our quest for symbols, we are hurting the environment and our relationships with each other.
	- A myth is an image in which we try to make sense of the world. All understanding is done by analogy. Two models of the universe have been prevalent over the last 2,000 years - the ceramic and fully automatic models. The ceramic is based on the Book of Genesis and is one where the world is made and this leads to a subject and ruler mentality. The fully automatic model holds that evolution is pushed along by the desire for survival, not by an intelligent designer ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj280mk0zcp8xes43c8a3be))
