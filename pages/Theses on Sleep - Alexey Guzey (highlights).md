	- Modern sleep, in its infinite comfort, is an unnatural superstimulus that overwhelms our brains with pleasure and comfort
	- In undergrad I had zero sleep before several major tests; also before quals in grad school. Basically wouldn’t sleep before things I really considered important (this included morning meetings I didn’t want to miss!). On such occasions I would feel:
	  
	  
	  
	  miserable, then
	  absurd and in a good humor, weirdly elated, then
	  Super PumpedTM, and
	  
	  
	  
	  really sharp when the test (or whatever) actually started.
