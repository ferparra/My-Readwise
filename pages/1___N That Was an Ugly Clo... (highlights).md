	- 1/n That was an ugly close on Friday. As you know I am extremely concerned about the upcoming economic risks and markets seem to be trying to reflect some of these concerns. However, I am also concerned that sentiment (not valuations) MORE than reflects these fears

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 2/n Couple of charts. First, did everyone forget about option expiry and portfolio rebalancing? Discretionary traders dumped positions into Feb and have not rebuilt. Meanwhile ETFs for hedging/rebalancing creates a consistent pattern. We bounced on retail flows as expected.

	- 3/n Dealer gamma was negative going into Friday which we know creates chasing. 2nd derivative is falling and expiry will help clean this up. Risk from here is an exogenous event (eg China) that spikes volatility. Always possible in neg gamma, but not base

	- 4/n Meanwhile positioning for strategies that target realized levels of volatility is at historically low levels indicating MOST of this selling has already occurred

	- 5/n And price/volume patterns suggest an interim bottoming pattern in the SP500. @Mike_Taylor1972 notes P/C ratio spiked from 0.42 to 1.0 in two days. Again, I hate this as much as everyone else, but just showing what I see...

	- 6/n Some may note that 100 day is about to cross below 200d. Clearly a bearish signal. Well... that has been a very painful strategy for the past 13 years.  In fact a losing strategy for the past 23 years including Dotcom and GFC. To be clear, you're calling recession NOW...

	- 7/n But is everyone bearish in action? No. Flows continue to pile in even as prices for equities fall suggesting this selloff is discretionary traders raising cash (plenty of evidence for this). What are they buying? Materials... as China imports turn negative YoY

	- 8/n If you thought the S&P close was ugly... what do you make of Natgas? A big red candle can be used to heat your home apparently...

	- 9/n I HATE this... I wish markets represented current fundamentals we can all agree on... but by definition that's not how markets work. You sell, I buy or no transaction occurs. With passive, that buying is mechanical and only stops when the jobs stop. Imho, not yet. My opinion. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/profplum99/status/1517946582276055042))
	- 10/n The dollar wrecking ball remains in consolidation. A breakout has yet to occur even as China has started to devalue (bearish commodities, bullish risk), JPY has tanked and EUR diverges positively with a Macron establishment win increasingly likely. Will this break higher?

	- 11/n I continue to think it does so eventually. But right now it's being powered higher by rate hike expectations as real forward rates have turned positive in an environment that likely requires low/negative real yields. Fed has jawboned rates much higher. Talk is cheap.

	- 12/n You want the Fed to deliver on those hikes? You can't crash the market. They may say they're not going to tolerate it, but with record slowdown in fast data (e.g. @FreightAlley transport data or Philly Fed new orders) we have to consider they may be primed to "disappoint" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/profplum99/status/1517946590203310080))
	- 13/13 So let's end on lucky 13... "You've got to ask yourself one Q: 'Do I Feel Lucky?' Because this is the most powerful bubble the world has ever seen and can blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya?"
