	- 1/ The greatest wealth transfer in the world's history has begun.
	  
	  An estimated $70 trillion. 
	  
	  It's not crypto, the stock market, or real estate.
	  
	  We're still in inning one, but word is spreading FAST! 
	  
	  I'll show you how you can get your piece of the pie below.

	- 2/ It's estimated that over the next 25 years, $70 trillion will be transferred from the Baby Boomers to the Millennials.
	  
	  Economists have dubbed this "The Great Wealth Transfer."
	  
	  And, a $7 trillion piece of that pie is up for grabs and has many of the smartest folks scrambling. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253324909395968))
	- 3/ More than 12 million small- and medium-sized businesses are currently owned by the Baby Boomers.
	  
	  That's a whopping $10 trillion in privately owned businesses. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253328051277825))
	- 4/ The crazy part, more than 70% of those businesses (or $7 trillion worth) are expected to be sold to UNRELATED, THIRD PARTIES by 2028. 
	  
	  This could be YOU! 
	  
	  I'll tell you why: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253331750649861))
	- 5/ Although most entrepreneurs love their business, it's common for them to not have a relative interested in assuming (or buying) the business. 
	  
	  The result, the business must either be shut down or sold. 
	  
	  Shuttering a profitable business is a waste, so sell they must! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253335097700353))
	- 6/ How much do these businesses typically sell for?
	  
	  In most cases, small businesses (with earnings < $2 million) typically sell for 2.5 times to 5.0 times earnings.
	  
	  (there are many variables, but that's a reasonable range for illustrative purposes) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253338201481217))
	- 7/ That means, for example, you could potentially buy a business producing $1 million in earnings for $2.5 million to $5.0 million. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253341363974147))
	- 8/ But, where would you get the money? 
	  
	  Very few people have the cash necessary to buy a business. 
	  
	  As a result, the Small Business Administration supports loans through its 7(a) program for exactly these purposes, which require in some cases as little as FIVE PERCENT down. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253344429998082))
	- 9/ This means that hypothetically, you could buy a business with $1 million in earnings for as little as $125,000 down.
	  
	  AND, if you spent a few years managing and paying down the debt, you could theoretically have MILLIONS in DEBT-FREE earnings.  
	  
	  Let that sink in... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253347282145281))
	- 10/ Still doubt you could pull it off? 
	  
	  Below is a thread from 
	  @chrisxmunn that provides an overview of the business buying process. https://t.co/uTCjMVN9AU ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253349693542401))
	- 11/ Don't get me wrong, buying a business isn't easy, but it's being done everyday. 
	  
	  In fact, many folks have done it recently (or are close!) and are sharing their experiences right here on Twitter. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253353560690688))
	- 12/ So, who is currently planning to buy these businesses? 
	  
	  Just about every type of person, including blue collar, white collar, doctors, lawyers, tech bros, even Ivy League MBA graduates (where entrepreneurship through acquisition programs have EXPLODED in popularity). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253356706725888))
	- 13/ In recent years, "Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition" or (ETA) programs have popped up at almost every elite business school, including Harvard, Penn, Chicago, Stanford, Duke, Columbia and many others. 
	  
	  These programs are *very* popular!
	  
	  Just ask @ColumbiaETA ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253359357546497))
	- 14/ Why are these programs so popular? 
	  
	  The pitch to elite MBA students is compelling: 
	  
	  You no longer need to go to Goldman or McKinsey and grind for years. 
	  
	  Instead, you can go buy a business with hundreds of thousands to millions in earnings and be a CEO at age 27. Juicy! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253362507476993))
	- 15/ The number of prospective buyers is increasing exponentially by the day, not just among elite MBAs.
	  
	  According to the @bizbuysell Insight Report for Q3 2021, corporate refugees (i.e., people wanting to leave their current job ) are currently fueling record buyer demand. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253366122967040))
	- 16/ Don't believe me?
	  
	  Have a look at the below chart previously tweeted by @tsludwig for a visual representation of the buyer growth: https://t.co/gnE3QjHTA1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253367620304898))
	- 17/ Seller's market
	  
	  This demand, coupled with the limited supply of high-quality businesses due to issues resulting from the pandemic, has resulted in record sale prices and stiff competition among buyers.
	  
	  However, that is starting to change! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253369818148864))
	- 18/ According to the report, a whopping 28% of business owners plan to sell in 2023.
	  
	  And, advisers are counseling sellers to start the process as soon as possible to get in before the market is saturated.
	  
	  Saturation = Lower prices ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1589253371718160385))
