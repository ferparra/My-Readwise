	- #ContentModeration is fundamentally about making social media work better, but there are two other considerations that determine how social media *fails*: #EndToEnd (#E2E), and #FreedomOfExit. 1/

		- **Note**: Thread
	- These are much neglected, and that's a pity, because how a system fails is every bit as important as how it works. 2/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876709051908098))

	- Of course, commercial social media sites don't want to be *good*, they want to be *profitable*. The unique dynamics of social media allow the companies to uncouple quality from profit, and more's the pity. 4/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876710909968386))
	- Social media grows thanks to #NetworkEffects - you join Twitter to hang out with the people who are there, and then other people join to hang out with you. The more users Twitter accumulates, the more users it *can* accumulate. 5/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876711778308097))
	- But social media sites stay big thanks to high #SwitchingCosts: the more you have to give up to leave a social media site, the harder it is to go:
	  
	  https://t.co/AExLifuczL 6/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876712600371200))
	- Nature bequeaths some in-built switching costs on social media, primarily the #CoordinationProblem of reaching consensus on where you and the people in your community should go next. The more friends you share a social media platform with, the higher these costs are. 7/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876713523118081))
	- If you've ever tried to get ten friends to agree on where to go for dinner, you know how this works. Now imagine trying to get *all* your friends to agree on where to go for dinner, for the rest of their lives!
	  
	  But these costs aren't insurmountable. 8/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876714479337472))
	- Network effects, after all, are a double-edged sword. 9/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876715750293505))
	- Some users are above-average draws for others, and if a critical mass of these important nodes in the network map depart for a new service - like, say, #Mastodon - that service becomes the presumptive successor to the existing giants. 10/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876716689821696))
	- When that happens - when Mastodon becomes "the place we'll all go when Twitter finally becomes unbearable" - the downsides of network effects kick in and the double-edged sword begins to carve away at a service's user-base. 11/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876717662896130))
	- It's one thing to argue about which restaurant we should go to tonight, it's another to ask whether we should join our friends at the new restaurant where they're already eating. 12/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876718598197255))
	- Social media sites who want to keep their users' business walk a fine line: they can simply treat those users well, showing them the things they ask to see, not spying on them, paying to police their service to reduce harassment, etc. But these are costly choices: if you… 13/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876719609069568))
	- …show users the things they *ask* to see, you can't charge businesses to show them things they *don't* want to see. If you don't spy on users, you can't sell targeting services to people who want to force them to look at things they're uninterested in. 14/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876720544403456))
	- Every moderator you pay to reduce harassment draws a salary at the expense of your shareholders, and every catastrophe that moderator prevents is a catastrophe you can't turn into monetizable attention as gawking users flock to it. 15/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876721622290432))
	- So social media sites are always trying to optimize their mistreatment of users, mistreating them (and thus profiting from them) right up to the point where they are ready to switch, but without actually pushing them over the edge. 16/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876722687688706))
	- One way to keep dissatisfied users from leaving is by extracting a penalty from them for their disloyalty. 17/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876723681640449))
	- You can lock in their data, their social relationships, or, if they're "creators" (and disproportionately likely to be key network nodes whose defection to a rival triggers mass departures from their fans), you can take their audiences hostage. 18/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876724621250562))
	- The dominant social media firms all practice a low-grade, tacit form of hostage-taking. Facebook downranks content that links to other sites on the internet. Instagram prohibits links in posts, limiting creators to "#LinksInBio." Tiktok doesn't even allow links. 19/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876725623705600))
	- All of this serves as a brake on high-follower users who seek to migrate their audiences to better platforms.
	  
	  But these strategies are unstable. 20/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876726584082434))
	- When a platform becomes worse for users (say, because it mandates nonconsensual surveillance and ramps up advertising), they may actively seek out other places on which to follow each other, and the creators they enjoy. 21/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876727443914754))
	- When a rival platform emerges as the presumptive successor to an incumbent, users no longer face the friction of knowing which rival they should resettle to. 22/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876728366776322))
	- When platforms' #enshittification strategies overshoot this way, users flee in droves, and then it's time for the desperate platform managers to abandon the pretense of providing a #PublicSquare. 23/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876729193009155))
	- Yesterday, #ElonMusk's #Twitter rolled out a policy prohibiting users from posting links to rival platforms:
	  
	  https://t.co/190W9FMob9
	  
	  This policy was explicitly aimed at preventing users from telling each other where they could be found after they leave Twitter: 24/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876730237423616))
	- https://t.co/0BG9wLHnKV
	  
	  This, in turn, was a response to many users posting regular messages explaining why they were leaving Twitter and how they could be found on other platforms. 25/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876731285905410))
	- In particular, Twitter management was concerned with departures by high-follower users like @TaylorLorenz, who was *retroactively* punished for violating the policy, though it didn't exist when she violated it:
	  
	  https://t.co/ow6MbV5mmZ 26/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876732242317313))
	- As Elon Musk wrote last spring: "The acid test for two competing socioeconomic systems is which side needs to build a wall to keep people from escaping? That's the bad one!"
	  
	  https://t.co/qjT3wNNzSy
	  
	  This isn't particularly insightful. 27/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876733160759298))
	- It's obvious that any system that requires high walls and punishments to stay in business isn't serving its users, whose presence is attributable to coercion, not fulfillment. Of course, the people who operate these systems have all manner of rationalizations for them. 28/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876734834278405))
	- The Berlin Wall, we were told, wasn't there to keep East Germans *in* - rather, it was there to keep the teeming hordes clamoring to live in the workers' paradise *out*. 29/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876735635488773))
	- In the same way, platforms will claim that they're not blocking #outlinks or #sideloading because they want to prevent users from defecting to a competitor, but rather, to protect those users from external threats. 30/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876736495292417))
	- This rationalization quickly wears thin, and then new ones step in. For example, you might claim that telling your friends that you're leaving and asking them to meet you elsewhere is like "giv[ing] a talk for a corporation [and] promot[ing] other corporations": 31/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876737531240449))
	- https://t.co/OkJQW3cpOG
	  
	  Or you might claim that it's like "running Wendy's ads [on] McDonalds property," rather than turning to your friends and saying, "The food at McDonalds sucks, let's go eat at Wendy's instead":
	  
	  https://t.co/nIEAhLnkZJ 32/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876738349219843))
	- The truth is that any service that won't let you leave isn't in the business of serving you, it's in the business of harming you. 33/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876739548745728))
	- The only reason to build a wall around your service - to impose *any* switching costs on users- is so that you can fuck them over without risking their departure. 34/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876740358176768))
	- The platforms want to be #Anatevka, and we the villagers of #FiddlerOnTheRoof, stuck plodding the muddy, Cossack-haunted roads by the threat of losing all our friends if we try to leave:
	  
	  https://t.co/n9s4d4QVas
	  
	  That's where freedom of exit comes in. 35/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876741494939649))
	- The public should have the right to leave, and companies should not be permitted to make that departure burdensome. Any burdens we permit companies to impose is an invitation to abuse of their users. 36/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876742425968646))
	- This is why governments are handing down new #interoperability mandates: the EU's #DigitalMarketsAct forces the largest companies to offer APIs so that smaller rivals can plug into them and let users #walkaway from Big Tech into new kinds of platforms - small businesses,… 37/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876743315169280))
	- …co-ops, nonprofits, hobby sites - that treat them better. These small players are overwhelmingly part of the #fediverse: the #federated social media sites that allow users to connect to one another irrespective of which server or service they use. 38/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876744200257541))
	- The creators of these platforms have pledged themselves to freedom of exit. 39/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876745152364544))
	- Mastodon ships with a "Move Followers" and "Move Following" feature that lets you quit one server and set up shop on another, without losing any of the accounts you follow or the accounts that follow *you*:
	  
	  https://t.co/ZT5moXBfxP 40/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876745936609282))
	- This feature is as yet obscure, because the exodus to Mastodon is still young. Users who flocked to servers without knowing much about their managers have, by and large, not yet run into problems with the site operators. 41/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876746913972233))
	- The early trickle of horror stories about petty authoritarianism from Mastodon sysops conspicuously fail to mention that if the management of a particular instance turns tyrant, you can click two links, export your whole social graph, sign up for a rival, click two more… 42/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876748197449731))
	- …links and be back at it.
	  
	  This feature *will* become more prominent, because there is nothing about running a Mastodon server that means that you are *good* at running a Mastodon server. 43/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876749032022019))
	- Elon Musk isn't an evil genius - he's an ordinary mediocrity who lucked into a lot of power and very little accountability. 44/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876749912801280))
	- Some Mastodon operators will have Musk-like tendencies that they will unleash on their users, and the difference will be that those users can click two links and move elsewhere. Bye-eee! 45/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876750713937920))
	- Freedom of exit isn't just a matter of the human right of movement, it's also a labor issue. Online creators constitute a serious draw for social media services. 46/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876751569653764))
	- All things being equal, these services would rather coerce creators' participation - by holding their audiences hostage - than persuade creators to remain by offering them an honest chance to ply their trade. 47/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876752580395008))
	- Platforms have a variety of strategies for chaining creators to their services: in addition to making it harder for creators to coordinate with their audiences in a mass departure, platforms can use DRM, as #Audible does, to prevent creators' customers from moving the media… 48/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876753436131328))
	- …they purchase to a rival's app or player.
	  
	  Then there's #FreedomOfReach: platforms routinely and deceptively conflate *recommending* a creator's work with *showing that creator's work to the people who explicitly asked to see it*.
	  
	  https://t.co/HsaVZVtCxq 49/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876754233036806))
	- When you follow or subscribe to a feed, that is not a "signal" to be mixed into the recommendation system. It's an *order*: "Show me this." Not "Show me things like this." 
	  
	  Show. 
	  
	  Me. 
	  
	  This.
	  
	  But there's no money in showing people the things they tell you they want to see. 50/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876755302600709))
	- If Amazon showed shoppers the products they searched for, they couldn't earn $31b/year on an "ad business" that fills the first six screens of results with rival products who've paid to be displayed over the product you're seeking:
	  
	  https://t.co/lg2CmrxEPq 51/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876756141367297))
	- If Spotify played you the albums you searched for, it couldn't redirect you to playlists artists have to shell out #payola to be included on:
	  
	  https://t.co/GVz8aT0WWA 52/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876757173149698))
	- And if you only see what you ask for, then product managers whose #KPI is whether they entice you to "discover" something else won't get a bonus every time you fatfinger a part of your screen that navigates you away from the thing you specifically requested: 53/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876758146220035))
	- https://t.co/AZdVOnS7e0
	  
	  Musk, meanwhile, has announced that you won't see messages from the people you follow unless they pay for Twitter Blue:
	  
	  https://t.co/b1quG44Qhu 54/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876759031287809))
	- And also that you will be nonconsensually opted into seeing more "recommended" content from people you don't follow (but who can be extorted out of payola for the privilege):
	  
	  https://t.co/24RD3zsDjI
	  
	  Musk sees Twitter as a publisher, not a social media site: 55/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876759991812096))
	- https://t.co/KDpIt4ptQ1
	  
	  Which is why he's so indifferent to the collateral damage from this payola/hostage scam. 56/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876760893497344))
	- Yes, Twitter is a place where famous and semi-famous people talk to their audiences, but it is primarily a place where those audiences talk to each other - that is, a #PublicSquare. 57/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876761904435200))
	- This is the #Facebook death-spiral: charging to people to follow to reach you, and burying the things they say in a torrent of payola-funded spam. 58/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876762852347904))
	- It's the vision of someone who thinks of other people as things to use - to pump up your share price or market your goods to - not worthy of consideration.
	  
	  As @robandterry's #GrannyWeatherwax put it: "Sin is when you treat people like things. Including yourself. 59/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876763993149442))
	- That's what sin is."
	  
	  Mastodon isn't perfect, but its flaws are neither fatal nor permanent. 60/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876764957872128))
	- The idea that centralized media is "easier" surely reflects the hundreds of billions of dollars that have been pumped into refining social media #RoachMotels ("users check in, but they don't check out"). 61/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876765905797125))
	- Until a comparable sum has been spent refining decentralized, federated services, any claims about the impossibility of making the fediverse work for mass audiences should be treated as unfalsifiable, motivated reasoning. 62/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876766853595144))
	- Meanwhile, Mastodon has gotten two things right that no other social media giant has even seriously *attempted*: 
	  
	  I. If you follow someone on Mastodon, you'll see everything they post; and 63/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876767700942849))
	- II. If you leave a Mastodon server, you can take both your followers and the people you follow with you.
	  
	  The most common criticism of Mastodon is that you must rely on individual moderators who may be underresourced, incompetent on malicious. 64/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876768615309326))
	- This is indeed a serious problem, but it isn't the *same* serious problem that Twitter has. When Twitter is incompetent, malicious, or underresourced, your departure comes at a dear price. 65/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876769542250498))
	- On Mastodon, your choice is: tolerate bad moderation, or click two links and move somewhere else. 
	  
	  On Twitter, your choice is: tolerate moderation, or lose contact with all the people you care about and all the people who care about you. 66/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876770452410376))
	- The interoperability mandates in the Digital Markets Act (and in the US #ACCESSAct, which seems unlikely to get a vote in this session of Congress) only force the largest platforms to open up, but Mastodon shows us the utility of interop for smaller services, too. 67/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876771819720705))
	- There are lots of domains in which "dominance" shouldn't be the sole criteria for whether you are expected to treat your customers fairly. 68/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876772679602183))
	- A doctor with a small practice who leaks all ten patients' data harms those patients as surely as a hospital system with a million patients would have. 69/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876773572984833))
	- A small-time wedding photographer who refuses to turn over your pictures unless you pay a surprise bill is every bit as harmful to you as a giant chain that has the same practice. 70/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876774524985344))
	- As we move into the realm of smalltime, community-oriented social media servers, we should be looking to avoid the pitfalls of the social media bubble that's bursting around us. 71/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876775305224195))
	- No matter what the size of the service, let's ensure that it lets us leave, and respects the #EndToEnd principle, that any two people who want to talk to each other should be allowed to do so, without interference from the people who operate their communications… 72/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876776269787140))
	- …infrastructure. 73/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1604876777284845572))
