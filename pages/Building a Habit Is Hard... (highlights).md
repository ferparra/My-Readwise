	- Building a habit is hard AF.

	  Here's a case for a new, unexpected habit that you should start building today.

	- 35,000. 
	  
	  Every day, you make 35,000 decisions. 
	  
	  Little decisions like what to wear. 
	  Big decisions like what job to take. 
	  
	  And every decision has an outcome that changes the trajectory of your life in some way.

	- Then why don't give our decisions the attention they deserve? 
	  
	  Why do we treat them like bets that we set and forget? 
	  
	  Decisions must be treated like products:
	- Think about it this way. 
	  
	  Let's say you're a couch manufacturer. 
	  
	  Quality control is going to be an essential part of your business. 
	  
	  From pre-production inspection to pre-shipment packaging, you'll review to make sure your couches are perfect.

	- Decisions are no different. 
	  
	  In business & in life. 
	  
	  The better you get at evaluating past decisions, the better you'll get at making future decisions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1394405035455488001))
	- So how do you improve the quality of your decisions over time? 
	  
	  It's called Decision Journaling. 
	  
	  First introduced to me by @ShaneAParrish, who described its use by Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize-winning Economist.

	- The story goes that legendary investor @mjmauboussin was meeting with Kahneman and asked him: 
	  
	  "What's the #1 thing to improve an investor's performance?" 
	  
	  Kahneman responded: "Go to a local drugstore, buy a very cheap notebook, and start keeping track of your decisions." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1394405041663057923))

	- 5 steps for every decision journal entry: 
	  
	  1) What is the decision? 
	  
	  2) What is the desired outcome? 
	  
	  3) Why do you believe the outcome will occur? 
	  
	  4) What are the consequences if the outcome doesn't occur? 
	  
	  5) How do you feel at the time? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1394405042938077189))
	- And that's it. 
	  
	  So simple yet so powerful. 
	  
	  A few other things to keep in mind while decision journaling:

	- In case you're not sold, here's why this habit is so valuable...
	  
	  1) It's simple, which makes it powerful 
	  
	  Complex behaviors never become habits
	  
	  2) It prevents hindsight bias
	  
	  We all over or underestimate our impact in decisions. 
	  
	  3) It forces clear decision-making today ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1394405050366271494))
	- And that is why decision journaling deserves to be a habit.
