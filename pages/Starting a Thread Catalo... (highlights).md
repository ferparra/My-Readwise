	- Kicking it off with Saunders Mac Lane’s incredible book Mathematics, Form and Function. Mac Lane is the co-inventor of Category Theory and this work shows the breadth and depth that has gone into the creation Category Theory: https://t.co/8N0rjKH9Vc

	- Form and function is not an introductory read but something to come back to once you have acquired sufficient proficiency in mathematics. The book doubles out as an atlas of mathematical inquiry with multiple maps of maths in here that helps you to navigate the field.

	- One of the best ways to approach a subject is to study its history. This gives a perspective on the motivation of founders and how the field took shape. To understand the history of Category Theory, we highly recommend @garlandus’ “Of Groups and Monads”: https://t.co/iezNedETWH

	- Jamie Vicary’s talk on Category Theory as a setting for visual mathematics was an eye-opening talk. He describes how geometry could be a missing link between the Curry-Howard correspondence of proofs and programs: https://t.co/jZx6jduKcT ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/patternatlas/status/1312768309465550850))

	- Now, a really good set of articles has been put out by @alexanderkatt illustrating category theoretical concepts visually. It is incomplete at the moment, but whatever is here is beautiful! Highly recommend checking it out: https://t.co/oPwzXz6C9R
