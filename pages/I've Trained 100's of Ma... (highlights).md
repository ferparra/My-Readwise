	- I've trained 100's of managers. 
	  
	  The 60% who fail make one mistake:
	  
	  They don't delegate

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ What should you delegate?
	  
	  Everything. Not a joke.
	  
	  You need to design yourself completely out of your old job.
	  
	  Set your sights lower than that & you'll delegate WAY less than you should.
	  
	  But don't freak out:
	  
	  Responsibly delegating that much will take months. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1501524459655598081))
	- 2/ Set Expectations w/ Your Boss
	  
	  The biggest wild card when delegating is not your team. 
	  
	  It's your boss. 
	  
	  You don't need to be perfect, you just need to show you're in control. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1501524462499287041))
	- So let her in on your plan:
	- 3/ Lower Risk, Faster Delegation
	  
	  Not all work carries equal risk:
	  
	  -> Critical: Quality can't be compromised. Stay close.
	  
	  -> Secondary: Mistakes sting but are not fatal. 
	  
	  -> Internal: Fully contained in your environment.
	  
	  -> Side Projects: Your team's sandbox, let them play. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1501524468388093958))
	- 4/ Set Expectations w/ Yourself
	  
	  Your team will not do it your way.
	  
	  So you have a choice:
	- And be honest with yourself:
	- 5/ Delegate for Your Development
	  
	  The only way you'll grow into a bigger role is by creating space. 
	  
	  That's the carrot every time you find yourself saying:
	  
	  "It's easier if I just do it myself this one time." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1501524476877434888))
	- Your initial delegation prioritization:
	  
	  1) Anything partially delegated -> Completion achieves clarity.
	  
	  2) Where you add the least value -> Your grind is their growth.
	  
	  3) The routine -> Ripe for a runbook or automation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1501524479616290816))
	- 6/ Delegate for Their Development
	  
	  Now focus on the stretch each employee needs to excel.
	  
	  Easy place to start: ask them how they want to grow.
	  
	  People usually know. And they'll feel agency over their own mastery.
	  
	  Bonus: Challenge them to find & take that work.
	  
	  Virtuous cycle. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1501524482472640512))
	- 7/ Set Expectations w/ Your Team
	  
	  Good delegation is more than assigning tasks:
	- 8/ The Mechanics
	  
	  You've already:
	- 9/ Watch out for:
	  
	  Delegating & walking away
	- 10/ Bonus: Radical Delegation
	  
	  I would recommend getting the basics down before going here. 
	  
	  But if you need a picture of what's possible, this is an inspiring one.

	- 11/ Want to go deeper?
	  
	  60% of new managers fail in the 1st 18 months.
	  
	  Why?
	  
	  They don't get trained in the tactics they need to thrive.
	  
	  Delegation is just one playbook we're going deep on in the next cohort of my New Manager Accelerator.

	- You faced your fear and empowered your team by delegating meaningful work. 
	  
	  Now what? 
	  
	  Too close: you're a micromanager. 
	  
	  Too distant: you're at risk of being blindsided by a big issue.
