	- When I look at my PKM systems for the last decade, they seem to have revolved around these three main ideas, and that's what I've settled for - for now:
	  1) Causality/Progression
	  2) Inclusion-exclusion
	  3) Contextual-association via time-space ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/syncretizm/status/1576600450815578112))
	- In Tana, I currently use:
	  -> and <- for Progression.
	  âŠ‚ and âŠƒ for Boundaries.
	  âœ¸/mentions/refs for Time-space association. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/syncretizm/status/1576600452933656576))
