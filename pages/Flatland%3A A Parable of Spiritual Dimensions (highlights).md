document_note:: Flatland is a parable about the limits of human understanding and the potential for growth in one's perception of the world. The narrator, a square living in a two-dimensional world, is shown a third dimension which he cannot initially comprehend. He is eventually taken to Spaceland, where three dimensions exist, and attempts to spread the knowledge, but is locked away due to the social unrest this would cause. The text follows the Square's journey, exploring the social classes of Flatland and their attempts to introduce color, the Universal Color Bill and the resulting war. The Sphere, a being from another dimension, attempts to explain the concept of the Third Dimension to the Square, but the Square does not understand, eventually leading to his imprisonment. The text ultimately suggests that humans should strive to expand their understanding of the world by looking for points of view that challenge their own.

	- Sphere - "Why will you refuse to listen to reason? I had hoped to find in you - as being a man of sense and an accomplished mathematician - a fit apostle for the Gospel of Three Dimensions, which I am allowed to preach once only in a thousand years: but now I know not how to convince you." Where is this land of Four Dimensions? There is no such land. The very idea of it is utterly inconceivable [Sphere] ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs6frewjvbtcbbgvxpt7gsr4))
		- **Note**: The Sphere is disappointed with the Square, who is a very smart person and good at math. The Sphere was hoping the Square would believe the Sphere's message that there is a place called Three Dimensions. The Sphere is only allowed to share this message once in a thousand years. But the Square won't believe it and the Sphere doesn't know how to make the Square believe. The Sphere also wants to know where the land of Four Dimensions is, but it doesn't exist. It's too hard to imagine.
