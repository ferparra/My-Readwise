	- 1/ Loop in the right people
	  
	  Every decision should ideally have one decision maker and fewer than five stakeholders to provide input.
	  
	  Avoid too many cooks in the kitchen.

	- 2/ Give context
	  
	  Write a decision doc with:
	  
	  1. List of people involved
	  2. Context
	  3. Recommendation (don't bury the lede)
	  4. List of options with pros and cons

	- 3/ Keep the discussion in one place
	  
	  Pick one channel or doc for people to provide input.
	  
	  Avoid starting a bunch of separate threads and then having to play a game of telephone to figure out who said what.

	- 4/ Push for a decision
	  
	  When it looks like people are reaching alignment, the decision maker should push for consensus or "agree to disagree".

	- 5/ Document and share the decision
	  
	  Once confirmed, share the decision far and wide so that everyone is on the same page.
