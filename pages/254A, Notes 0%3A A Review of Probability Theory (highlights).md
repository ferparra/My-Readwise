	- **Definition 3 (Random variable)** Let be a [measurable space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_space) (i.e. a set , equipped with a -algebra of subsets of ). A *random variable* taking values in (or an *-valued random variable*) is a measurable map from the sample space to , i.e. a function such that is an event for every . ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9jd6mv24ae2fjh9xdbhz8x))
	- *Discrete random variables*, in which is the discrete -algebra, and is at most countable. Typical examples of include a countable subset of the reals or complexes, such as the natural numbers or integers. If , we say that the random variable is *Boolean*, while if is just a singleton set we say that the random variable is *deterministic*, and (by abuse of notation) we identify this random variable with itself. Note that a Boolean random variable is nothing more than an [indicator function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function) of an event , where is the event that the boolean function equals .

	- *Real-valued random variables*, in which is the real line and is the [Borel -algebra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_set), generated by the open sets of . Thus for any real-valued random variable and any interval , we have the events ““. In particular, we have the *upper tail event* “” and *lower tail event* “” for any threshold . (We also consider the events “” and “” to be tail events; in practice, there is very little distinction between the two.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9jdekn38rbxmtjzn21jdjs))
