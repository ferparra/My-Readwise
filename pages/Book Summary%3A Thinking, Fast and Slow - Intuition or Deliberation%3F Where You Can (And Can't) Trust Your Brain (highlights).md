- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- System 1 is the part of our brain that operates intuitively and suddenly, often without our conscious control.
	- System 2 is what we think of when we visualize the part of the brain responsible for our individual decision-making, reasoning and beliefs.
	- Priming, just like other societal elements, can influence an individual’s thoughts and therefore choices, judgment and behavior – and these reflect back into the culture and heavily affect the kind of society we all live in.
	- In a state of cognitive ease, the intuitive System 1 is in charge of our minds, and the logical and more energy-demanding System 2 is weakened. This means we are more intuitive, creative and happier, yet we’re also more likely to make mistakes.
	- Messages are more persuasive when we’re repeatedly exposed to them. This is probably because we evolved in a way that made repeated exposure to things that had no bad consequences seem inherently good.
