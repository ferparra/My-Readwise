		- **Note**: Thread
	- Built using @nextjs with the @t3dotgg stack, @LangChainAI, #GPT3 and 
	  
	  Established from ideas by #BabyAGI from @yoheinakajima and #AutoGPT from @SigGravitas ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/asimdotshrestha/status/1644883731960979456))
	- It works through using models to generate a task list and then iteratively executes tasks, evaluating whether or not tasks are completed or require further sub-actions.
	  
	  In the future, we'll have long term memory via @pinecone and give models the ability to query the web ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/asimdotshrestha/status/1644883733328310273))
	- Really excited to see where this goes, shoutout to the folks that helped build this @SrijanSubedii and Adam@ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/asimdotshrestha/status/1644883734649507842))

	- Of course its a bit limited in terms of capability at the moment but we're working to metaphorically give AgentGPT arms / legs / and eyes. 
	  
	  You'll soon be able to browse the web, deploy software, and so much more ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/asimdotshrestha/status/1644925182887469056))

	- Update: We're hitting scale limits on both Vercel and OpenAI. We've just added the ability to use your own API key on the platform. Unfortunately, this will be a requirement just until we can get scaling sorted out! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/asimdotshrestha/status/1645519323656773633))
