	- **“If consciousness is the fundamental nature of reality, and consciousness is all there is, then mathematical structure is only about the possibilities of consciousness.”**  
	  — Donald Hoffman ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4j7cc2tprd4ps6cz696a4j))
	- **“What is the probability that natural selection would shape sensory systems to report true properties of objective reality? … The probability is zero.”**  
	  — Donald Hoffman ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4j7p0g81dywfemwdmjbm78))
	- **“Very few of us know exactly how the desktop interface on our computer works. When you drag an icon to the trash can to delete a file, there’s a lot of stuff going on inside there that’s involved in deleting the file. We’re blissfully ignorant and that’s what evolution has done. It makes us blissfully ignorant about the nature of reality and gives us icons that allow us to control reality.”**

	- **“Physics is not fundamental. Spacetime is not fundamental. Consciousness is. What we call physical objects are merely the ways that we play with our interface to open new portals into the realm of conscious agents.”**  
	  — Donald Hoffman ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4j8avfs2tn46g5qvr87fkn))
	- **“Science can never have a theory of everything.”**  
	  — Donald Hoffman ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4j8f658mk61h0ey3akkg7f))
	- **“When you can break your theory, when you find its limits, that’s when you break out the champagne because that’s when you’re going to go to the next step. Gödel’s incompleteness theory tells us that this process will never end. There is job security. Go into science.”**

	- **“When the physicists are saying, ‘We’re spending our careers looking for what’s beyond spacetime; spacetime is doomed,’ it’s really time for the cognitive neuroscientists who are studying consciousness to catch up with what the physicists have already said.”**  
	  — Donald Hoffman ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4j8wzvf596g7j3v1k6hkq1))
	- **“I want a scientific theory of consciousness that doesn’t assume a physical world as the foundation at all.”**
