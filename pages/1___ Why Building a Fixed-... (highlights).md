	- 1/ Why building a fixed-rate protocol is hard.

	- 2/ Letâ€™s start with  variable rate lending markets like Aave or Compound. These are 2-sided marketplaces - they have lenders and borrowers.
	  
	  Interest rates need to be high enough for lenders, but low enough for borrowers.
	  
	  If you lose one side, the thing falls apart. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teddywoodward/status/1511387727924707334))
	- 3/ Fixed rate protocols introduce a new kind of user - the LP.
	  
	  LPs facilitate lending activity and make money off fees. Every time a user lends or borrows, the LP takes a transaction fee similar to Uniswap.
	  
	  Without LPs, users canâ€™t lend or borrow. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teddywoodward/status/1511387728851742725))
	- 4/ So instead of a 2-sided marketplace, you have a 3-sided marketplace.
	  
	  That means you need to keep all three user groups happy. Rates need to be low enough for borrowers, high enough for lenders, and there needs to be enough volume to generate fees for the LPs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teddywoodward/status/1511387729749237763))
	- 5/ To make things harder, the transaction fee that LPs charge has to be small in order to not impose undue costs on the lenders and borrowers. 
	  
	  Closer to fees on Curve pools than ETH/USDC Uni V2 pools.
	  
	  This means you need a LOT of volume to generate enough fees for the LPs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teddywoodward/status/1511387730680463365))
	- 6/ This is hard, but not impossible. 
	  
	  One of Notional V2â€™s key innovations was to integrate with Compound and Aave so that LPs earn the variable lending rate on top of their trading fees. That helps. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teddywoodward/status/1511387731678711812))
	- 7/ For now, organic USDC and DAI LP returns on Notional are about ~2% APY. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re incentivizing them with $NOTE. 
	  
	  As the DeFi fixed rate market continues to grow, so will those returns. And Notional will deliver for all three user groups.
