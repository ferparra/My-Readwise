	- It would be great to get critique of behavioral economics from someone who knows some behavioral economics. Alas, today is not that day. 
	  
	  This article is so off-mark that it‚Äôs worth clarifying the misses in short üßµ 1/n

	- Behavioral economics incorporates psychological factors that are important for *economics*. If you read article with priming and identifiable victim as examples of core BE, stop reading. These being core, or even tangential, would be surprise to any behavioral economist. 2/n ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexoimas/status/1431709163898474498))
	- Pick up Winner‚Äôs Curse which outlines some of the core concepts that launched behavioral economics as field, and it‚Äôs hard to find anything that does not replicate. And believe me, economists have tried! See work by Charlie Plott and others begrudging that anomalies are real 3/n ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexoimas/status/1431709164712116224))
	- What about loss aversion? First, loss aversion and framing are two different concepts. Loss aversion‚Äîlosses being treated as larger than equivalent gains‚Äîhas been replicate thousands of times. A framing effect is when seemingly irrelevant changes to decision impact behavior. 4/n ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexoimas/status/1431709165957828616))
	- A framing effect that attempts to induce loss aversion (which the author mistakenly calls loss aversion) requires a person to perceive the two frames as a loss vs gain. 5/n ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexoimas/status/1431709166876377095))
	- Just because rephrasing something does not produce a behavioral effect does not mean loss aversion is not real. It probably means that people did not perceive the gimmicky marketing (author‚Äôs words) shtick as a loss. 6/n ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexoimas/status/1431709167673282561))
	- Actual evidence for loss aversion abounds. See review that collects evidence and addresses fallacy in recent critiques https://t.co/wQJLfyC7mW
	  
	  Or you can replicate the studies yourself. They‚Äôre some of the most replicable effects in social sci https://t.co/eNNm6tFMtv

	- But for best evidence on ‚Äúrobustness‚Äù of BE one only has to look to the field with best data on decisions w learning and high stakes‚Äîfinance. It‚Äôs also the field that has embraced BE the most, with its own NBER working group. So the proof is in the pudding :)

	- Addendum: I do agree with the article‚Äôs claim on the death of behavioral economics, but for a different reason. BE will slowly fade away because it‚Äôll just become economics, with its core concepts being incorporated into various subfield. We already see this happening. 9/8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexoimas/status/1431709684604538886))
