	- Here's why loops are better than funnels...
	  
	  A funnel works top to bottom.
	  
	  To get more out of the bottom...you need to put more in at the top.
	  
	  This means more money.
	  
	  Where funnels focus on linear growth.
	  
	  Growth loops focus on compounding growth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1391208714628210689))
	- Look at the fastest growing products and you'll notice they acquire customers through loops. Not funnels.
	  
	  @andrewchen defines loops as "closed systems where the inputs through some process generates more of an output that can be reinvested in the input."
	  
	  6 examples 👇🏽 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1391208715651592199))
	- 1. Viral Acquisition Loops 
	  
	  1. User signs up
	  2. Invite or content is sent to friends
	  3. % of friends click the link

	  PayPal is another great example of using a viral acquisition loop.

	  2. Loops focus on compounding growth
	  3. Fastest-products grow with loops
	  4. A loop's input generates an output that's reinvested into the input
	  5. Funnels focus on linear growth
	  6. More at the top = more at the bottom ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1391208738405629955))
