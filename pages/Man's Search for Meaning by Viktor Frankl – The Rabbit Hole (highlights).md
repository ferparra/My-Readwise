- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- Men died less from a lack of food or medicine than from lack of hope, lack of something to live for
	- Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation
	- Success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself
	- A man can get used to anything, but do not ask us how
	- An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior
	- …it is not the physical pain which hurts the most (and this applies to adults as much as to punished children); it is the mental agony caused by the injustice, the unreasonableness of it all
	- Suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore, the “size” of human suffering is absolutely relative
	- The crowning experience of all, for the homecoming man, is the wonderful feeling that, after all he has suffered, there is nothing he need fear any more – except his God.
	- mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become.
	- “If you want to stay alive, there is only one way: look fit for work”
	- Logotherapy focuses on the future, on the meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in his future. It focuses on the meaning of human existence as well as on man’s search for such a meaning (logos is Greek for meaning)
	- Suffering is not necessary to find meaning.
	- In today’s age, people have enough to live by but nothing to life for; they have the means but no meaning
