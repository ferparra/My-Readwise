document_note:: In "The Truth" by Neil Strauss, he details his personal journey of dealing with his own desires while wanting to form meaningful relationships. Through his experiences, Strauss reveals the key learnings he has discovered about commitments and relationships, including the idea that anything emotionally traumatic is permanent and will manifest itself in various ways, the sins of parents can affect their children's destinies, and the importance of becoming an "independent spectator" of one's own life in order to better understand the baggage they carry. Additionally, he emphasizes that true love only exists when one's love for another exceeds their need for them, and that the best thing one can do for others and themselves is to strengthen the relationship with oneself.
