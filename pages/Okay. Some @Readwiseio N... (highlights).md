- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- Okay. Some @readwiseio news â€” the biggest since we started the company.
	  
	  We built our own reading app!
	  
	  Save anything, from articles to PDFs. Then read (with powerful highlighting, search, and triage) inside of the Readwise Reader.

	- @readwiseio There's much much more to it, but 2 quick notes:
	  
	  * Reader is in closed beta right now, but we're moving rapidly towards making it public
	  
	  * This product is _real_: Reader has been working for power readers like @packyM and @EricJorgenson on iOS, Android, and desktop web ðŸ‘‡

	- @readwiseio @packyM @EricJorgenson What makes Reader different?
	  
	  If you've used Instapaper or Pocket, it's like those except it's built for power readers, and built for 2021.
	  
	  You can save anything to it (from twitter threads to newsletters), and actually feel confident you'll read and retain the content.

	- @readwiseio @packyM @EricJorgenson Of course, we built the highlighting and sync' features we (and our users) have always wanted:
	  
	  Highlight anything, including images and tables, & have that data flow seamlessly into your note-taking apps.

	- @readwiseio @packyM @EricJorgenson A huge problem we've found almost universally in read-it-later apps is that it's easy to save content, but hard to go back and actually read it.
	  
	  A core part of the Reader is solving this problem, helping you feel in control and on top of your reading queue.

	- @readwiseio @packyM @EricJorgenson In one sense, this was the motivation for us building the Reader: 
	  
	  Constant requests for help from our users, and not being able to do anything about it, because we didn't control the reading experience. 
	  
	  Now, we're able to rethink what it means to read, and read productively. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/homsiT/status/1435727022962221056))
	- @readwiseio @packyM @EricJorgenson In another sense, we've been working towards this since we started Readwise in 2017.
	  
	  It's always been our mission to improve the practice of reading, and we knew at some point we'd have to build a reading app.
	  
	  @deadly_onion & I expound on this in depth:

	- @readwiseio @packyM @EricJorgenson @deadly_onion Finally, and most importantly, Readwise is now a team of 10!
	  
	  @tdkte @lynchy010 @erinmuur @ArtemLitch @anzi11ah @mirchich & newly @jessebc, @TucciMatias
	  
	  Can honestly say it's the best team I've worked with in my life, why we've been able to ship such a broad product so quickly ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/homsiT/status/1435732308540207106))
	- @readwiseio @packyM @EricJorgenson @deadly_onion @tdkte @lynchy010 @erinmuur @ArtemLitch @anzi11ah @mirchich @jessebc @TucciMatias That's all for now.
	  
	  Check out the blog post for WHY we're building Reader, and https://t.co/xsbJnS0U5t to get on the private beta :) 
	  
	  Excited to have you all along for the next chapter of Readwise ðŸ“–
