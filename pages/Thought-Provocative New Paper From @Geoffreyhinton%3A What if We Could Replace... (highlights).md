document_note:: Geoffrey Hinton proposes a new method of training neural networks called the Forward-Forward algorithm, which does not use backpropagation. This method is based on the concept of generating "good data" by merging input images with the right labels, and "bad data" by merging input images with the wrong labels. It involves updating weights in each layer to excite the network when presented with good data, and minimize activations when presented with bad data. This method also lends itself to self-supervised learning, and can be implemented with power-efficient analog circuits.
