	- I made a comment a week ago about reading Julian Jaynes' The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind with large language models in mind in lieu of consciousness and the experience has been personally mind-blowing. Jaynes' idea of the Bicameral Mind fits perfectly into the user-application dichotomy, specifically in reference to how large language models are currently used--in an admonitory and imperial manner.
	  
	  Courtesy of Wikipedia's article on bicameral mentality:
	  
	  "Bicameral mentality is non-conscious in its inability to reason and articulate about mental contents through meta-reflection, reacting without explicitly realizing and without the meta-reflective ability to give an account of why one did so. The bicameral mind thus lacks metaconsciousness, autobiographical memory, and the capacity for executive "ego functions" such as deliberate mind-wandering and conscious introspection of mental content. When bicameral mentality as a method of social control was no longer adaptive in complex civilizations, this mental model was replaced by the conscious mode of thought which, Jaynes argued, is grounded in the acquisition of metaphorical language learned by exposure to narrative practice.
	  
	  "According to Jaynes, ancient people in the bicameral state of mind experienced the world in a manner that has some similarities to that of a person with schizophrenia. Rather than making conscious evaluations in novel or unexpected situations, the person hallucinated a voice or "god" giving admonitory advice or commands and obey without question: One was not at all conscious of one's own thought processes per se. Jaynes's hypothesis is offered as a possible explanation of "command hallucinations" that often direct the behavior of those with first rank symptoms of schizophrenia, as well as other voice hearers."
