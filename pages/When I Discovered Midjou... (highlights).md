	- When I discovered Midjourney, I wanted to use it productively.
	  
	  It took some time to figure out a consistent visual style.
	  
	  I decided for low-poly 3D render aesthetic.
	  
	  Here's the before and after images:

	- I tried to keep the visuals consistent, but it wasn't easy.
	  
	  Sometimes I found a nice small object representing the use-case, like the studio microphone or projection screen.
	  
	  But this didn't work for events and conferences.

	- Sometimes I was able to get some shallow depth-of-field that made the images really dynamic. I really like those.
