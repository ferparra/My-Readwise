	- 1) Get Thanks
	  
	  Neuroimaging, EEG (brain electrical recording) and psychology studies show that the positive effects of a gratitude practice primarily occur when we receive, not when we give, gratitude. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1486808182483681280))
	- 2) Make it Genuine
	  
	  The genuine intention of the gratitude giver has a direct impact on the degree of positive effect felt by the person receiving the gratitude (the thankee). So give thanks, but do so with honesty. It matters. https://t.co/Aw0tG7Cc9W ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1486808184647868416))
	- 3) Observe/Recall Others Giving & Receiving Genuine Thanks
	  
	  Having a story you can recall in which someone received genuine gratitude is beneficial. Recall that story 1-3 times per week. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1486808187118362628))
	- 4) Introversion & Extroversion Reflect Social Homeostasis
	  
	  Studies on introverts and extroverts suggest that introverts like social interaction but are socially satisfied faster than are extroverts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1486808189416837121))
	- The takeaway is to offer (or take) opportunities to exit social interactions early and not feel guilty about it or take offense. The extroverts can keep at it until they get the dopamine they need. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1486808191698571266))
	- 5) Merge Physiologies
	  
	  Build social bonds by hearing, watching or sharing stories. Being on your phones is not the way to do that. Watching movies, hearing someone tell stories, playing or listening to music, etc. are all excellent paths to this. Do those things together.
