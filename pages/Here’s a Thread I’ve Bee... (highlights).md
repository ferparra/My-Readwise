	- Here’s a thread I’ve been meaning to do for a long time about eye tracing and spatial orientation in Mad Max: Fury Road. It’s really about one very specific moment — just a few seconds, in fact — but a good opportunity to talk about stuff like axial cuts and visual landmarks.

	- If you’ve seen Fury Road (and you really, really should), you probably know that it’s incredibly dense: even outside the action sequences there’s tons of subtext and backstory to pick over. But within the action scenes a gargantuan amount of information is relayed.

	- George Miller is, at heart, a director of theory and logic. He identifies what kind of story he wants to tell and with what effect, and then chooses (or invents) his tools accordingly. In Fury Road’s case that meant cuts. Lots of cuts.

	- Miller noticed the trend of quickening edits in the years before he shot Fury Road (The Bourne Supremacy, arguably the trend’s most important catalyst, released in 2004; Fury Road began principle photography in 2011). He figured audiences were learning; they could handle it.

	- But as many of the trend’s detractors were quick to point out, when shots go by faster they’re more difficult to process. Action can quickly become incoherent, and while some canny filmmakers embraced chaos, Miller wanted clear, causal chains of action. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575371430891786240))
	- So he had an idea and gave his cinematographer John Seale marching orders: when filming material that’s going to be cut quickly, keep the most important information in the center of the frame, so that the shot doesn’t cut before your eyes can find the subject. https://t.co/RcYn4PD3if ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575371476810989568))
	- Every time there’s a cut in a movie, your eye spends time searching the next shot for what's important. Even within a shot, your eye searches, guided by the composition and the action within it. There’s great writing on this on David Bordwell’s blog. https://t.co/IvYf7sGStB ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575371480455843840))
	- When we have a formal cue of where to look, it's quite easy — note how the eyes look instantly from one side of the screen to the other during the left-right shot reverse conversation. Then look at the cut at 5:21.

	- The eyes are much less consistently focused. There's some attention to the tracks at the start, but then increasingly scattered gazes until the car on the right becomes more prominent.

	- All this is to say that eye trace is not a bad thing. In There Will Be Blood, Paul Thomas Anderson and Robert Elswit *want* you to feel lost, to look down the tracks and get a sense of the vastness of the space, before refocusing on Daniel Plainview's story. It's good  technique. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575371487770714112))
	- In the midst of Fury Road's frenzies, Miller and John Seale definitely do *not* want you to feel lost. They're happy to overwhelm you, but they want to take you along. And they're very, very fastidious about using this center-framing technique; here's four consecutive shots.

	- At times the choreography between camera and subjects is stunningly elaborate in its attempts to keep subjects in the center, or to gracefully move from one focus to center another within a single shot. You probably didn't even realize it was happening a lot of the time. https://t.co/3gypg89gF7 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575371568695619584))
	- Just look at how the camera curls to shift its center from the lethality of the chainsaw to Max's vulnerable body to his flip-around of the War Boy to the swing of the weapon at its unintended target.

	- Miller could have allowed the movement within the frame to guide our eye alone in that moment, and that would have worked great for this shot on its own. But he's determined to earn our trust — what's most important will *always* be in the center. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575371580347412481))
	- Because Fury Road is so consistent, even though we're used to having to quickly scanning frames in action scenes, this subconscious conditioning works very quickly. We often underestimate how fast we're capable of learning, and how quickly films can teach us, if we're open to it! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575371581534380033))
	- In quieter scenes, though, Miller tends to loosen up a bit, allowing his subjects to fall into balance across the frame. He encourages us to relax and search each shot freely. A shifting style of compositional balance is used to control tone and pacing.

	- But this raises another point, one I haven't really heard remarked upon in discussions of Fury Road's center-framing: this movie has a very wide aspect ratio of 2.39:1. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FdzOjFnakAA0H20.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575371591957254144))
	- Why? if your goal was to ensure that the audience focused on the center of frame at all times, why not remove informational dead weight on the sides and use an aspect ratio of, say, 1.37:1? 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FdzP1KHagAIfI7e.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575371596386410496))
	- (One answer to this is that studios usually insist on tentpole blockbusters using a wide aspect ratio, with 1.85:1 being as tall as they go. But let's focus on creative motivations and results here.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575371598005403648))
	- The answer is simple: the sides are not dead weight. The intent is for us to understand that the most important thing in the frame will always be at the center. Not that nothing relevant will ever be on the sides of the frame. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FdzQQ6IaEAAl0Wg.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575371602887610369))
	- How does this play out? Well, it turns out that, in our field of vision beyond the thing that our eyes are directly focused on, we retain some ability to comprehend what we're looking at. And that brings me to the little moment — and little observation — this thread is about. https://t.co/nWzI3RqGCc ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575371673603571713))
	- What thing is on the side of the frame more than anything else in these shots? That's right, I'm sure you've all guessed, you can lower your hands: it's the truck. And not just the truck — the truck at a particular angle. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FdzUp-oakAE3ueI.jpg)

	- The truck is generally located across the right side of the frame throughout the scene, but in the two camera setups used for shots like the ones in the last tweet, it's occupying almost the same space in the frame. OK, so: why? Because Miller is orienting us with axial edits. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FdzVh5MaUAAb6qg.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575371688640147456))
	- An axial edits is a cut that moves straight towards or away from the subject of the shot while closely retaining that subject's position in the frame. Here's an example of axial edits — axial dissolves here — from Citizen Kane. I pumped the contrast a bit so you see it clearly https://t.co/cteeYxANin ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575371737763827713))
	- Like most techniques, there are a ton of uses for axial edits. One thing they tend to do very clearly is move us backwards or forwards in space. A visual anchor helps us do that. So why does Miller want to give us that anchor? To establish the scene's main conceit... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575371741224128512))
	- ...the chain. Someone pulls one way, Max is yanked. Someone pulls the other, Nux is yanked. Miller bounces us back and forth in depth to make the physicality of the chain and its causal effects crystal clear to us, and he uses the truck as our anchor, our visual landmark.

	- As the scene goes on, Miller takes off the training wheels. He doesn't give us the clear geographical landmark for reference, and he speeds up the edits to take full advantage of the visceral power of rapid cutting. Chain pull, guy fall. https://t.co/NjRWV9EhHD ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575373134752256000))
	- That's it, really. It just amazes me how Miller uses all these complex techniques guiding our eye across a 2D plane, using that 2D plane to orient us in 3D, giving the frame's sectors a consistent hierarchical importance, all while staging extremely complex action choreography. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575373660772536320))
	- And he does this with so much precision, so much empathy and respect for his audience, that he teaches us how to understand and appreciate everything he's doing seamlessly as he goes. I love this movie. Thanks for reading.

	- A few people have commented that I didn't mention Margaret Sixel by name, and I wanted to clarify that I worship her work, have talked about it many times before, and was focused here on choices made in preproduction and production to enable the kinds of edits I discuss. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SadHillWill/status/1575500558903152641))
	- That said, you can make a fair argument that I should have found ways to at least bring her name up to give due credit, so I just want to do that here and say that arranging the edit this way to take full advantage of all these possibilities (and find new ones) is amazing.
