	- I've made a GPT4 debate bot for myself. It pulls any writings I have on the topic from @logseq, figures my position and starts a chat forcing me to argue the other side. Then points out inconsistencies and flags logical errors. I'm never going to leave my keyboard. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1641402262223200259))

	- I'm going to call it "High rung thinking twitter" in honor of @waitbutwhy's awesome book. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1641402730404085760))
