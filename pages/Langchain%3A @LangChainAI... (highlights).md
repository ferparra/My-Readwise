	- Langchain: [[@LangChainAI]]  (https://t.co/YKgFgNfTfm)
	  
	  A pythonic interface to building more complex programs with [[LLMs]] 
	  
	  Very bullish on the potential here!
	  
	  If you have more complex [[business logic]] for your LLM app and want to host your own [[backend]], this is the play. https://t.co/nCVKYci9ZM ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mathemagic1an/status/1595128726270144512))

	  [[@LangChainAI]]  is a [[python]] package with a convenient [[API]] for weaving [[LLMs]] into working programs
	  
	  For instance: code below builds a python docstring generator

	  Instead of defining prompts and your LLM graph in a UI (like @everyprompt @dust4ai ), you define them in python.
	  
	  That gives you more flexibility/control in defining your program. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mathemagic1an/status/1595128733043949569))
	- 4/ 
	  
	  Since it's all in code, it's more cumbersome to build with than e.g. a GUI (like @dust4ai )
	  
	  That being said, tracking mods to your computation graph in git sounds like best practice. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mathemagic1an/status/1595128734306033664))

	  Finally, a potential game changer:
	  
	  They provide a simple API around "agents," or LLMs that can somehow interact with "tools" (like a python interpreter or search engine) in order to answer questions
	  
	  The below program hits up both Google and Python to arrive at an answer

	- 6/ 
	  
	  You can define your own "Tools" for LLMs to interact with. 
	  
	  For instance, I could write a Tool that retrieves info from my computer's filesystem based on something like an xpath query.
	  
	  This is the "glue" that enables LLMs to interact with the outside world

	  One of the developers, @hwchase17 , has also indicated they will be adding the ability for agents to write to external data structures
	  
	  Big win for extending context sizes. Excited to see what new apps this enables.

	  Overall, [[@LangChainAI]] 's approach - building a batteries-included python package - is the other half of the puzzle to what @dust4ai and @everyprompt provide.
	  
	  Others are oriented around the UI, [[@LangChainAI]] is oriented around the programming tools you already use ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mathemagic1an/status/1595128745136095232))
	- 9/
	  
	  Obvious area for [[@LangChainAI]] to expand into - pairing this with a web UI. 
	  
	  It should:

	  Highly recommend checking out this project and excited for what @hwchase17 and the [[@LangChainAI]] team put out next ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mathemagic1an/status/1595128747703033858))
