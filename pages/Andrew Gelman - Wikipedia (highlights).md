	- Gelman defines the standard approach to statistical inference as, in rough terms, defining the null hypothesis as there being no statistically significant effects of any covariates and accepting any significant effect as evidence in support of the alternative hypothesis; concretely, he frames conventional statistical hypothesis testing as expecting a null value in a statistical test and a non-null value as a significant outcome.
