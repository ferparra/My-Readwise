	- A Simple Zettelkasten in Tana
	  
	  Tana is the PERFECT tool for building a digital Zettelkasten, and in this new video I show you how to set one up for yourself.
	  
	  All you need are three supertags (+1 for sources)

	- Fleeting Notes
	  
	  Fleeting notes are a mere reminder of what's in your head - think post-it notes.
	  
	  Not for storage, just to have something to jot things down.
	  Ergo: just a simple tag, not even a single field!

	- Literature Notes
	  
	  These are short summaries and insights from your reading in your own words. Be very selective and super careful to not just copy quotes.
	  
	  Two fields: one to connect to a source, one for the page number.

	- Permanent Notes
	  
	  These are your own thoughts, written like they are for someone else. Even if you return in a year or two, you'll still understand what it is about â€“ full sentences, precise, clear, and brief.
	  
	  I've set them up with Topics as a field, and one for related notes.
