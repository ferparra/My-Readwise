	- @mulegirl Computer science taught me the "how" of making tech (data structures, algorithms, etc...). But I was always more interested in the "what". What problems are we solving? Is it making people's lives or jobs easier? Without that, the best "how" won't matter. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/c_d_los/status/1092130088836050949))
	- Part of leadership is knowing when to lie low around those you have authority over. Is the team having a low stakes debate? Don't chime in, even to completely agree with the decision. It undercuts their autonomy and makes them think they need approval more than you might intend. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/c_d_los/status/1387977989896523793))
