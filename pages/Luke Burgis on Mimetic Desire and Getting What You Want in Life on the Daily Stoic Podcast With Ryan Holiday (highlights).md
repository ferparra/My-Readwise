document_note:: Luke Burgis joined Ryan Holiday on The Daily Stoic podcast to discuss mimetic desire and how to achieve what you want in life. Mimetic desire, as proposed by French polymath René Girard, is the idea that human desire is influenced by the desires of others, and is contagious. Social media and influencers have heightened the effect of mimetic desire, leading to the cycle of never being satisfied. To break the cycle, one must learn to desire deeply the career and things one already has. To understand mimetic desire and make better decisions, one must take the time to establish critical distance and question assumptions. Additionally, it is important to avoid emotional reactions and to strive to have people around who think differently. The pandemic has caused some to become more confused than ever, and it is important to look at desires prior to the pandemic and find those that will endure.
