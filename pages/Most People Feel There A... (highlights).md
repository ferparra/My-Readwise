	- Most people feel there are too many meetings.
	  
	  However most people also hate the idea that they aren’t being included in important conversations and decisions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1614584319007424512))

	- Inclusive work environments sounds great on paper. However in practice they result in managers feeling like they have to include many more people in each meeting than is strictly necessary to get a decision. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1614585348956332032))
	- Even then, you can’t invite everybody to everything. As a result cliques tend to form, making inclusive, low hierarchy work environments feel weirdly exclusive, as smaller groups struggle to get stuff done.

	- “Stanford University research showed that the more inclusive managers tried to be by involving more people in meetings, the more the quality of outcomes declined”

	- A big part of a managers job is communication. Communicating decisions, communicating rational, and communicating intent. Some people are good at this. Others less so. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1614588992019730432))
	- However it’s also reliant on the team to be receptive to those communications. Managers often find themselves needing to repeat the same messages (often when it comes to company strategy) multiple times before they land. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1614589384707170304))
	- As a result I often see teams complaining that they don’t “understand the strategy” or weren’t informed about a certain decisions when it was shared at an all hands, sent round in a deck, shared via email and posted on Slack. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1614589906361147393))
	- It’s also worth noting that with so many micro-decisions happening every day, it’s almost impossible to communicate with the desired level of fidelity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1614590152638189570))
	- As such, at some stage you just have to accept that you won’t be part of every conversation and decision, and that to some extent you need to trust that the right people are being invited to meetings, and the right decisions are being made.

	- We talk a lot in the design world about seagulling managers. Those managers that drop in unannounced to ask what your working on, or provide unfrequented feedback. Don’t they trust us? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1614590684777910276))
	- Of course it’s the managers job to know what their teams are doing, how they are getting on, and help solve any challenges they might be facing. Seagulling usually happens when team members aren’t sharing progress enough, causing managers to wonder how things are going. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1614591101083553792))
	- I believe there is such a thing as “reverse seagulling” that happens when teams don’t feel (rightly or wrongly) included in every decisions and put social pressure on managers (often through moaning) to be better kept in the loop. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1614591707902771201))
	- And ironically this results in more emails, more slack messages, more decks and more meetings, which we’ll then complain about, because they’re getting in the way of us doing “the actual work”. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1614591948634968064))
	- I should add that humans are deeply social and status driven animals who want to feel needed. As such, being invited (or not invited) to certain meetings plays heavily on this. As a result I think meeting culture is the manifestation of personal and collective anxiety. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1614596748797935616))
