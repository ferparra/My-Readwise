	- How do we make products people use? How many of your apps on your phone do you not use?
	  As we work on products we have the curse of knowledge...  We forget what it's like to not know where everything is on product and how it works.

	- We need to interact with customers to close the gap btw what customers know and what we know.

	- You can't put source this work! Only the product trio can move fast enough to keep up with the knowledge.
	  As well, the game of telephone --Research to product to design-- too much is distorted. Better to hear first hand.

	- Some people think only the trio does discovery, but more people can participate. You balance speed with fewer ppl with insight quality when you have an expert in the room. Trio decides how to balance and when to invite.

	- I used to think if I create value for customer it would make money and that's enough. But you have to create enough value for the business as well. Google reader is an example.

	- If you focus on outcomes, you can be empower product teams to figure out what to build. 
	  (Fyi @ttorres is a Pencil Me In fan for visual thinking.)

	- Small experiments to discover how to achieve the outcomes. Not all businesses do this yet, but industry is moving in this direction.

	- Recruiting can be the biggest barrier. Automate it so every Friday you have an interview on the books.

	- Work with the people who talk to customers all day, like support. Tell them, when a.customer has a problem, put an interview on my calendar.

	- We can ask the obvious questions but it may not be what people actually do. We tend to be optimistic and present our ideal selves when we answer questions.

	- Instead, collect stories. Ask, tell me about the last time you used this product.

	- We tend to react to the last customer we talked to. Instead, keep all interviews together organized so you can contextualize insights. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cwodtke/status/1509963100463591425))
	- When we come up with one solution, we tend to over invest in it, the question becomes "do it or not."
	  With many solution ideas, our brain will compare and contrast.

	- Is he fast? Compared to what. A cheetah? A Tesla? 
	  Other runners.. yes! 
	  Compare and contrast equal things.

	- Companies often build out a product then a/b test it, which is a crazy waste of time. Example, if Netflix wants to add live sports, they could try these tests.

	- Adding more kinds of assumptions to explore, including usability and ethics! 
	  What assumptions are we making?

	- Story map the assumptions you are making about how you think users will do? 
	  (Reminds me of @indiyoung opportunity maps)

	- Each assumption is faster and easier to test than a complete solution.

	- There are fast ways to prototype answers to these smaller questions.
