	- Memorable Writing 101
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Step 1: Framework
	  
	  Everyone loves a good system.
	  
	  Whatever it is that you're writing about, step back from it for a moment. Notice HOW you're thinking through it in your mind. 
	  
	  Then, name each step & call it something.
	  
	  WabamðŸ’¥ 
	  
	  That's a "framework." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1400304002386984964))
	- Step 2: Story
	  
	  Knowing how something works is great. But people remember STORIES.
	  
	  The trick here is to find a story that embodies what you're explaining, but is highly unconventional to your category. 
	  
	  Ex: if your framework is for psychology, tell a story about an NBA player. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1400304003339100161))
	- Step 3: Actionable Advice
	  
	  You've given the reader a treasure map.
	  
	  You've told them "a success story."
	  
	  Now, help them find their own treasure, too.
	  
	  Where writers fall short here is they *motivate.* YOU CAN DO IT TOO! That's not what's valuable.
	  
	  Tell them HOW. Be specific. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1400304004324724738))
	- Step 4: Repeat
	  
	  This framework works for one Atomic Essay.
	  
	  It works for a Twitter thread.
	  
	  It can also be repeated over and over again into a long article.
	  
	  It can also be repeated over and over again into a full book.
