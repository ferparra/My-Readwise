document_note:: Reality tunnels allow us to understand that everyone lives in a different reality. This understanding can help us to be more compassionate about and patient with people, as we recognize that they may have different beliefs and values which shape their behavior. This can help us to avoid judging others and instead strive to create an environment of understanding and respect.

	- One thing I did find in my research though, that is absolutely fascinating and makes aton of sense, is that the more intelligent the person, the more likely they are goingto be able to hold crazy empirically, crazy beliefs, because when a highly intelligentperson finds that belief, he or she builds an ironman argument for why that belief is
	  
	  true.And especially if they're assertive and/or extroverted types, they are going to assertthat belief with a great deal of conviction.So they first convince themselves and then they go out and convince everyone else.Right?Will Storr: Yeah.Yeah.That's true.And as I think I've written about that in a couple of my books and what is believedthat we are not naturally very good at looking for reasons why we might be wrong about things.
	  
	  So what we do is we happen upon a belief that feels true, that kind of matches the storythat we're telling about how the world works.So who are the good guys?Who are the bad guys?Who am I?And that feels true to us.And then what we do is we go looking for evidence that we're wrong and as soon as we find abit of evidence, they call it the make sense stopping rule.We think, "Oh, that makes sense," and we stop thinking about it.So that's how we think, that's how we reason, unless we are given specific rules.

		- **Note**: "People who are really smart can sometimes believe things that don't seem true. When a smart person finds a belief, they can make a strong argument for why it is true. Especially if they are confident and like talking to people, they can be sure of the belief and try to convince other people of it too. We don't usually look for reasons why we might be wrong about things, so we accept beliefs that fit our understanding of the world. But if we find a bit of evidence that doesn't fit our belief, we just ignore it. That's how we think and reason unless we have a specific plan to look for evidence that proves us wrong."
	- You start by saying, "Life is a game.There is no way to understand the human world without first understanding this.
	  
	  Everyone alive is playing a game who's hidden rules are built into us and then silentlydirect our thoughts and emotions and virtually everything else that we do in our behavior. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs1vrbmd8yw76szaaskx2z83))

	- I'm a huge fan of Robert Anton Wilson.I don't know if you're familiar with him, but he was a buddy of Timothy Leary and he
	  
	  started calling the various belief systems, reality tunnels.And I really loved that explanation because he would teach a class and his room was offa very long hallway.And the first exercise of each new semester was he asked his students to draw the hallway.And people couldn't draw, could describe it, et cetera.And he was fascinated by this idea that of the 30 descriptions and or drawings, none
	  
	  of them were the same.And so he came up with this idea that we all exist in different reality tunnels and thatone of the primary things that cause a great deal of human angst and despair is the factthat we don't understand this.And we don't understand that this other person, maybe isn't really trying to aggressivelycome in on our beliefs.He or she just lives in a different reality tunnel.

		- **Note**: Robert Anton Wilson proposed the idea of "reality tunnels", which suggests that everyone experiences the world differently due to their own beliefs and perspectives. To illustrate this, he asked his students to draw the hallway outside his classroom and realized that no two descriptions or drawings were the same. He believed that this lack of understanding of different reality tunnels was a source of human angst, and that people should not assume that others are trying to challenge their beliefs, but rather that they just live in a different reality tunnel.
	- If you wanted to rule the world, save the world buy the world or fuck the world, thebest thing is to do is to pursue status.Please elaborate on that.I love that line.Will Storr: Yeah.So yeah, when I'm talking about status, I'm not arguing that everybody wants to be famous.Everybody wants to be rich.Everybody wants to be good looking, although most of us do want to be rich and good looking.I'm starting that we want to feel of value in the world.
	  
	  That's what status is.Status is not the feeling that we‚Äôre loved and accepted, that's connection.That's different.It's belongingness.It is the feeling that we are of value to our tribe, to our people.And so the discovery that's become kind of a fundamental human need, not a want, buta need that when we don't feel valued by the world that we suffer psychologically and evenphysically, I think is extraordinary.It's massive.And that's what the book is about.And I suppose in that passage, you've just quoted, what I'm trying to get to is the kindof absolutely fundamental nature of these games we play for status.
	  
	  If you want to buy the world, buy the world, rule the world, whatever it was, fuck theworld.The first thing to pursue is status.And that's true, if you want to buy the world then you need to pursue status in the [inaudible]of investment banking.That's what you need to do first if you want to rule the world.You need to play status games of power in politics.If you want to fuck the world, you need to play status games in becoming rich and famousand good looking.So in order to treat anything in life, the first thing to pursue is always status.

	- social media has a tremendous amount of problems, and primarily because of our,again, evolutionary, it's in our base code to be tribal, and first we want to fit inand then we want to stand out.I think that's one of your lines, but you also mentioned the Milgram experiments, the
	  
	  Stanford prison experiment, which are absolutely chilling.And to the level of dehumanization that people can quickly sink, talk a bit about that andthe idea, obviously we see this happening on social media.Everyone is tribing up and it's us vs them.And I think that for the most part, that leads to horrible results.I think that there's another path for social media where you'll still have that, but thatyou can find a disparate group of thinkers that can engage in meaningful discussions
	  
	  and that it's not all bad.But talk to me a little bit about social media and these dehumanizing games.Will Storr: Well, the Stanford prison experiment, sinceI wrote about that in the The Unpersuadables, that was about 12 years ago, that's becomemuch more controversial these days.There's a couple of things in The Unpersuadables that have fallen out of vogue, the Stanfordprison experiments and the implicit association test that I also wrote about in that book,which has also fallen out of vogue.The initial Zimbardo's thesis about the Stanford prison experiment was that we are all vulnerable
	  
	  to falling into evil behavior if we're put into certain conditions.That if you're put in a bad barrel, you will automatically become a bad apple.So the updated version of that theory really is in the status game, and that's social identitytheory.And that adds a big caveat, which is first, you have to identify with the role that you'replaying in life.So it's perfectly possible to be a prison guard and identify as somebody who pursuesrehabilitation, peaceful measures, and be a lovely prison guard.
	  
	  But it's also very possible to be a prison guard and perhaps arguably more likely, certainlyin the UK and the US and identify as somebody that measures their status with the practiceof harsh punishment and physical aggression and their ability to control dangerous people.And those are the ones that are potentially going to cause problems.So in the context of social media, I guess what that means is that what I'm arguing isthat we all play different status games and the status games that we play all have different
	  
	  rules, and they all have different measures by which we measure status.Or in the words of Academic Jerome Barkow, criteria for claiming status.So some status games, their criteria for claiming status is that they are aggressive and theyuse strategies of dominance to shout over people, to punish people, to get them removedfrom their jobs, to destroy them reputationally, which is a kind of death as far as I'm concerned.
	  
	  So those are the status games that we want to avoid. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4d3avgepw73jp6v3vn95te))
		- **Note**: Social media can have a lot of problems because people are naturally drawn to be in groups and want to both fit in and stand out. The Milgram and Stanford Prison experiments show how people can become very cruel to each other very quickly. This can happen on social media too when people group together and it‚Äôs us against them. But there is another way to use social media, where people with different ideas can have meaningful discussions. This can help people become more understanding and avoid cruel behavior. When it comes to social media, there are different games people play to measure their status. These games can involve hurting other people's feelings or even trying to ruin their reputation. We should try to avoid playing these games.
