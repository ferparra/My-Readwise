	- "Relaxing the Constraints on Predictive Coding Models" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01047), from the same authors. Looks at ways to remove neurological implausibility from PCM and achieve comparable results. Sadly they only do MNIST in this one, and are not as ambitious in testing on multiple architectures and problems/datasets, but the results are still very interesting and it covers some of the important theoretical and biological concerns.
