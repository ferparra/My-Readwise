	- I speak to a lot of people, many who do very well in life. But what really makes people "happy?" 
	  
	  Here's a thread on the things that I've found seem to make people the happiest. 1/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1454462912215531534))

	- Stop Comparing. Whether you are wealthy or poor, there are always people doing better than you, look better than you, or have things you don't.
	  
	  Being happy in your own skin is one of the biggest keys to joy I see. 2/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1454462913205477377))
	- Don't settle in who you marry. Be picky and marry the "right person for you." 
	  
	  Seek out traits that compliment or support yours, and don't ignore red flags. They will often determine the mood of your home, and a very large part of your life experience - for better, or worse. 3/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1454462914128224257))
	- Take care of health issues. That thing that nags you that you don't take time to address? Address it.
	  
	  A sure way to drain your happiness is to be uncomfortable or struggling in some way. Make the appointment. 4/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1454462915474599936))
	- Do more things you enjoy. Sounds silly, but you probably have hobbies you "used to love" that you don't do anymore- running, painting, golf, travel, etc. 
	  
	  Make it a point to find time for some   things outside of work. 5/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1454462916418228227))
	- Seek more positive, less negative. If you are always focused on negative or fearful things around your competitors, politics or life...it's a real mindset killer. 
	  
	  They all can be important, but have a place. Be optimistic, and see possibility. 6/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1454462917563256834))
	- Have some money in the bank. Maybe it's controversial, but money does bring happiness in some ways. It helps to solve problems, and make life better. 
	  
	  From healthcare, childcare, just ordering food on a lazy night, or taking a vacation when you need to...have a few bucks. 7/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1454462918599266309))
	- Move your body. You don't have to be an Olympian, but staying active keeps you happy. 
	  
	  A lot of people I work with will take on physical challenges - a marathon or whatever, but just walking daily can be a real positive shift. 8/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1454462919685689348))
	- Have new experiences. Working 24/7 can make everyday feel the same. 
	  
	  Shake things up. Go for a bike ride, visit a local town and walk around - just do something different. Give life some variety. 9/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1454462921073889285))
	- Find ways to give back. Mentor a kid from your old neighborhood, deliver some groceries to the food bank, shovel your neighbor's snow on the sidewalk, or go pay off someone's dental bill. 
	  
	  You'd be surprised how fantastic it makes you feel to help others. 10/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1454462923846344707))
	- I'm sure there are a lot more ways to increase happiness out there, but these are ones I see routinely that seem to add to the richness of people's life & keep their mindset in good places. 
	  I encourage you to add a few to your week ahead. 11/fin ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/drgurner/status/1454462924962111496))
