	- People are asking me "Whats the best way to use Avocado?" 
	  
	  @instadapp Avocado and @brave make the perfect pair! With Brave's profiles and Avocado's account abstraction, you have the ultimate web3 interface!

	- Use a separate Brave profile to easily organize and access your favorite DApps on a dedicated browser. 
	  
	  I would recommend pinning the Avocado page so its always available to sign transactions üìå https://t.co/C32hH0Uw0s ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/StevenMatcha/status/1646021133680902144))
	- I think I should add when using this, drop all your extensions (goodbye Metamask!) When creating a new profile on Brave for Avocado don't install wallet extensions.
	  
	  We're using @Brave Wallet here frens! ‚üÅ ‚üÅ ‚üÅ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/StevenMatcha/status/1646021138177314816))
	- Brave Profile + Avocado + @WalletConnect brings you a luxe web3 experience üíéüôå
	  
	  Once connected DApps will be remembered by Walletconnect making it easy to jump to your most used DApps ü•∑

	- Can't find your token on the interface? Add any custom token to Avocado by using Custom tokens found on the bottom of the token list. https://t.co/bQqll8tNEL ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/StevenMatcha/status/1646021148453339138))
	- @brave wallet also has support for Trezor and Ledger so you access and use Avocado on Brave and have your account backed by a hardware wallet.
	  
	  Secure, Flexible and powerful Account Abstraction is here and its even better with Brave üí™

	- @Brave is quickly becoming my favorite way to use Avocado ü•ë
	  
	  I lovingly call this the 'Bravado' setup.
