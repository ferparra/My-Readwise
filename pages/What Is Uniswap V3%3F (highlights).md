	- When exchanging, token A is added to the smart contract and then a certain proportion of token B is released. The amount that is returned from exchanging is dependent on the ratio between the two assets in the contract and follows a specific formula.

	- Users that lock up assets into the Uniswap contracts are known as a liquidity providers (LPs). LPs are incentivized to provide assets in order to collect the trading fees charged by the protocol.

	- When providing liquidity to a Uniswap market, liquidity providers will be able to select a range where their liquidity will take effect. Now the liquidity can be concentrated in a smaller area which will allow for higher volume trades with less slippage since everyone's liquidity no longer needs to be stretched all long the price curve.

	- let's say from $0.99 to $1.01 for the USDC-DAI pair. As a result, the liquidity providers are able to collect more fees with less liquidity because their assets are only active in that band, which is where most of the trading happens for the USDC-DAI pair.

	- Aside from adding a range, users can now deposit a single asset, specify a small range, and if the price hits the other end of the range it will have sold all of the one asset provided to the other asset in the pair. Thus selling all along the range and collecting fees along the way.

	- Since liquidity providers are able to specify a range where their liquidity is active, there will be markets that constantly fluctuate and will require the LP to be more active than in Uniswap v2. As a result, it's likely there will be protocols that are liquidity aggregators that manage a large number of LPs assets and constantly optimize ranges for more volatile markets.
