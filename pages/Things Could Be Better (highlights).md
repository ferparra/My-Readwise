	  (* Ethan and Adam believe that the tendency to always feel dissatisfied is a fundamental law of psychology., * This tendency may be useful in helping us realize our goals, but it comes at the cost of preventing us from ever being satisfied.)

	  I think it really matters because as psychologists, we've sort of played around for about 100 years, finding a lot of individual effects which are small and don't tell us a lot about how the mind really operates. There are some big exceptions, but it's very, very rare that we find something that seems like it could even plausibly be, you know, a rule of psychology, a fundamental law of how minds work. And I don't know if this is, you know, we haven't actually studied it that much in the grand scheme of things. Only two researchers have taken an interest in this effect so far, us. But I think this is plausibly, this is the sort of thing that could be a fundamental law of psychology, and we should be spending more of our time trying to find things like this. So I think it's exciting for that reason.

	  Why is it that we never feel satisfied? Any hypothesis?
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  I don't know. I don't know. We tried a bunch of things to try to get to this, and it never worked. And so I have no idea, and I look forward to hearing from everyone on the internet about why this might be the case, and then maybe we can all work together to test it, but I really do not know.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  And I'm not afraid to admit it. You know, look, when you have no idea what's going on, you can always turn to evolution. We're pretty sure that that's real, that exists. So would this tendency make sense from an evolutionary standpoint? You know, our ancestors were sitting in the cold and the rain, and they were hungry, and they thought about how things could be better, that if their tummies were full and they lived in shelters, and they did those things, they survived, they reproduced, we are their descendants. It could be that this tendency in our imagination is useful. It helps us realize our goals, but it comes at the cost of preventing us from ever being satisfied.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  There is a really interesting perspective on psychology, which is that it's all about understanding errors. Like, difference is either in prediction or in desire, and so like, from this perspective, then it would make sense that at some level, existence is suffering because because you're designed to build that, to detect that, you're built in that way, and so like, that's what registers. I think that being human means being a little dissatisfied all the time, and always reaching for the thing that you think will make things better.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Yeah, I mean, it's keeping us going, right? Just keeps us going. I want to thank both of you for letting me talk to you about how things could be better. It's been awesome. Thank you so much for talking to us. Thank you so much.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  This is really fun. Yeah, thanks for having us. I cannot imagine how this interview could have been better. Me neither.
	  
	  Speaker 2
