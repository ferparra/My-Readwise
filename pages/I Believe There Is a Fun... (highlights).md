	- I believe there is a fundamental disconnect between the way designers and business people think. A disconnect that causes a huge amount of personal dissatisfaction. Let me try and explain... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411349258733867010))

	- As designers we’re taught to think about our practice through the lens of The Double Diamond. That the “right” way to design is to do research, understand the problem, explore a range of options, and come up with an optimal solution.

	- As a designer, this is how I like to work. To understand the ins and outs of the problem, come up with a bunch of different options, before focussing on the most elegant and effective solutions. Or as I said recently...

	- While this makes logical sense, our business partners will find this all very frustrating. They (believe they) know what needs to be built and just need somebody to manifest it. 
	  
	  @johncutlefish describes this as a feature factory.

	- Feature factories are deeply unsatisfying for craft obsessed designers as it turns them into “short order chefs”. It feels like we’re somehow skipping the parts where we feel we can add the most value to both the companies we work and the users we serve. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411353472650330117))
	- It feels like we’re being asked to turn our backs on the double diamond, dumb down our work, and betray the craft.
	  
	  And all this is true, to a certain extent.
	  
	  However (and this my come as some uncomfortable reading), but maybe our business partners are right? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411355354168893442))
	- (With some huge caveats, obviously). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411355426642350084))
	- As designers we naively think that the best product wins, and we’ll often translate “best product” to “best designed product that meets the users/customers needs in a way that delights them, based on a deep understanding”. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411356178416762886))
	- However history shows us examples over and over again of initially crappy products slowly (and then much more rapidly) gaining market share. Many (but not all) of these products eventually end up with a good design, but this is typically though countless rounds of iteration. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411358573813276673))
	- Iteration a lot of us designers sit scratching our heads over. If you’d only have let us do the right research/product discovery up front we could have got you there much faster, and avoided a tonne of waste along the way. All of which I’d argue was still true. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411359186017996800))
	- This is where the fundamental category error creeps in. In the early stages of a product, designers think the game is to create the best version of the product, when it’s really just about getting something marginally better than what’s currently being used out the door. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411360177626963975))
	- A lot of this comes down to the “crossing the chasm” concept. In the early stages of a venture, cash flow is generally more important than quality, and with the right sales and marketing in place you should hopefully tempt enough early adopters to try your crappy product.

	- What you build in the early days is almost certainly wrong, and will most likely get thrown out later on (a fact that feels crazy and wasteful to most designers like myself). In the early stages of a new venture, neither the company or the market are really ready for quality yet. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411361931177385991))
	- Which is super frustrating, baffling and counter intuitive for us designers. Not least because it goes against everything we know, have learnt and hold to be true. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411362280533540865))
	- Now all of this is not to say that, as designers, we shouldn’t continue to try and ship the best product possible. Or to try and educate our business partners on the benefits on good research, good product discovery, and not always shipping the first most obvious feature. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411363051283046401))
	- But we do need to understand that for a large part of a product’s life, the process is optimised around speed and efficiency over solution fit. That the most successful designers are essentially pragmatists. And that great is often the enemy of good. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411363759898218499))
	- As a result, we need to view products over a 5+ year lifespan, rather than through the lenses of a release or a series of sprints. Something that’s very difficult to do when we bounce between jobs every 18 months. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411364451660480513))
	- And that our role isn’t necessarily to come up with the perfect solution right out of the gate, following the structure of the double diamond. But is instead to put something out into the world that’s better than what existed before. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411365029413335044))
	- Because in most instances, while we think we’re optimising around quality and solution fit, we’re more often than not working in a context that if it’s truthful is really optimised around speed (and probably doesn’t see, understand or value the deficiencies that we see). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411365741169893382))
	- Which is super frustrating, but simultaneously the nature of things. In the meantime, we’ll keep arguing for more time and resources to “design the right thing, and then design the thing right” while our business partners will keep the pressure on to JFSI (just flippin ship it). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411366538293268482))
	- We’ll be annoyed and frustrated by the situation. We’ll point to the double diamond in exasperation. We’ll moan about feature factories and grumble about product managers behind their backs (still the hardest job in tech).
	  
	  https://t.co/Een4zKr01S ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411367222879133701))
	- Hopefully this tension between our desire to design the right thing and our business partners need for speed and efficiency will balance each other out and we’ll reach some natural equilibrium. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411368761379131397))
	- But for a practice that tends to mourn the missed potential of what could have been, over the great improvements that they actually made, it’s going to continue to be frustrating going. It’s the designers lot. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411369311042736134))
	- Also a big apology for this crazy Twitter stream of consciousness, but I’ve just got back off a weeks holiday in the new forest and this has been buzzing around in my subconscious. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411369859003432965))
	- Some great follow up thoughts from @dingstweets here.

	- The top two reasons why startups fail is because they either fail to find a market or they run out of money trying. User experience comes in at number 6. So is it any wonder PMs and Execs are eager to get something  to market quickly.
	  
	  https://t.co/bgQLtuEF1G ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411968265572790280))
	- Of course as a designer I would probably claim that the reason they failed to find a market was because they didn’t take time to understand and validate their customer needs and build a product that met them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411968719287422978))
	- Therein lies the tension. Designers generally believe in exploring the problem space, iterating towards a solution and then launching. Founders often believe in launching, seeing how the market reacts and then iterating/pivoting if needs be. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411969621180178434))

	- Both approaches have their value, and in reality you probably need some combination of the two. However without understanding and clearly articulating our respective world views, we end up in conflict. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411970327115096065))
	- So like most things in life, having a clear understanding of our own perspectives and biases, taking time to understand those of the people we work with, communicating the differences clearly, and coming up with a mutually agreeable approach is usually best. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1411970856474103808))
	- I think this thread from @shreyas demonstrates some of my thinking here. Founders and product people are often focussed on creating maximum leverage by reducing opportunity cost and getting an OK thing out the door quickly.

	- Whereas us designers have been taught from an early stage to focus on delivering as much value as possible, which typically comes from creating the best version of the thing possible.

	- We've been taught that the best way we can add value is to focus on ROI. However the best designers will focus on maximising leverage instead.
