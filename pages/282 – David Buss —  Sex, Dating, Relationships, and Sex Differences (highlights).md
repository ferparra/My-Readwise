	- The Meaning of the Word Love
	  
	  Summary:
	  Love is a broad category, broad definition, and absolutely includes the emotion of love. There are many different types of love, brotherly love, love for parents, for children. But men, there it's pretty well established that there are these different phases of love. We're our psychologywe get obsessional thoughts. It's hard to focus on work when we're not with the person. The word 'love' has been used in various ways since its invention by caucasian european poets more than 100 years ago.

	  That you're going to stick this out for a while and have multiple children, is that also mating? Yes, I include that as well. So it's a broad category. Bright definition. And absolutely includes the emotion of love. And of course, there are many different types of love, brotherly love, love parents for children. But love, I think, and this is one of the shifts in the social sciences. So when I was an undergraduate, for example, I was taught that love is this invention by some Caucasian European poets a couple hundred years ago. And it turns out that's not the case. So there's been extensive cross cultural evidence now that people, not every person in all cultures, of course, but some people in all cultures, experience this emotion that we call love.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  And for the word love, are we going to this conversation try to stick to sort of romantic love for the meaning of the word love? Well, that's a great question.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  But I mean, it's pretty well established that there are these different phases of love. So there's this infatuation phase where our psychology, we get obsessional thoughts. It's hard to focus on work when we're not with the person we're thinking about, the other person constantly. ([Time 0:17:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1f47d2b8-e0dc-4808-99e0-5cea2f5ca2fe))
	- We Compete For Mates Using Language
	  
	  Summary:
	  Mating is inherently a competitive process. desirable mates are in scarce supply relative to the numbers of who want them. That's why there's mate poaching. Mate poaching is one of the strategies that we, and my lad with david schmidt, have studied.

	  And I mean, if you go to even things like how we compete for mates, and this is another kind of strange for some people, angle on it, but mating is inherently a competitive process in that desirable mates are in scarce supply relative to the numbers of people who want them. And so even post mating after, that is after mates selection, mate attraction, and mutual mate choice, desirable mate, that's why there's mate poaching. Mate poaching is one of the strategies that we in my lab with David Schmidt have studied. And so, okay, but one of the unique aspects of humans is that we compete using the language. And that is we have reputations. And humans devote a lot of effort to maintaining the reputations, to building the reputations, to trying to recover reputations after a loss of reputation for various reasons.

	  I will dispense this advice now. Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they're faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you look back at the photos yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibly lay before you. And how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine. Don't worry about the future or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be the things that never cost your worried mind. The kind that blinds sides you at 4 p.m. On some idle Tuesday do one thing every day that scares you. Saying don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with the people who are reckless with yours. Floss. Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes your head, sometimes you're behind. The race is long and in the end it's only with yourself. Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.

	- Why Are Men in Positions of Power More Than Women?
	  
	  Summary:
	  Women prefer men who have power, status and resources. This creates selection pressure on men to attach a high motivational priority to clawing their way up the status hierarchy. So women spend more effort maintaining relationships with their kin, their friends, their friend that works,. And so in a way, s you can say, not only are they in positions of power more than women, now you're blaming women for they are. But i think that that what i just outlined is is an essential part of the causal process.

	  In the meeting selection aspect. So it's going to sound strange or and hopefully not offensive to people, but if you ask the question why are, why is it the case that men are in positions of power so much more so than women? Well, in part, it can be traced to women's made preferences. So it's one of the sex differences that women have over evolutionary time preferred men who had power status, resources, etc. And what that has done is it's created selection pressure on men to attach a high motivational priority to clawing their way up the status hierarchy. And studies of time allocation distribution show this where men are more willing to sacrifice their friends, their grandmother, their kin or whatever to claw their way up to the top of status hierarchies women, much less so women spend more effort maintaining relationships with their kin, their friends, their friend networks and so forth and so, and so in a way, you could say, not only are you not only are men in positions of power more than women now you're blaming women for why they are. And it's not a matter of blame, but I think that what I just outlined is an essential part of the causal process, the co-evolution of women's made preferences with men's motivational priorities.

	  So what jealousy does is it alerts you to a threat to the relationship, and it motivates checking out the source of the threat. How threatening is this? So people tend to increase vigilance of their partner in the modern world and includes hacking into their cell phone or computer, monitoring them, sometimes stalking them, but also can include positive things. So it might be that, so one trigger of jealousy is a direct threat to the relationship. But there's another more subtle trigger of jealousy, which is a mate value discrepancy. So usually when people mate, they sort or pair up on overall mate value. So in the American 10 point scale, the eight tend to pair up with the eight, six is with the sixes, the 10s with the 10s and the ones with the ones.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  American, is there other other scales? I wonder if the miracle systems, well, there's a binary. I just go to binary 01. Sorry. The eighth pairs with the eight, seven, seven. Yeah, so in general, but there are errors in mate selection.
