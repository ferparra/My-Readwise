	- But again, there is that second  thing we need to learn from this,  which we should apply to ourselves, which is  somewhat the antithesis of the first thing.  Which is, it is actually not in your best interest  to be the kind of person who can only learn from  
	  
	  entertaining content, right? Nor should you  be the kind of person that needs any sort  of entertainment as a prerequisite for learning.  Because if you can absorb that and implement that,  then you will be way ahead of 95% of the people,  because you'll just end up learning more.

	- most people are  binary thinkers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw1j1fjyhrqvky7hn5meg0j))
	- explore  that unexplored infinite space,  instead of just fixating on finding a great  manager for yourself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw1pj3dp94wnw978p3dmwpv))
		- **Tags**: #[[antithesis principle]]
	- ook for culture, look for company growth.  In some cases, when you find those things,  you may have to sacrifice on the manager stuff,  and that's okay ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw1yc8xearfyqem2ysgcb12))

	- you need to understand a certain thing  about the world, apply it so you can be effective,  but you may need to adopt the antithesis of  that to yourself, so you can be a wiser, kinder,  happier, more effective person to yourself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw1p0mw1xg0p7frr3nya9jk))

	- The stupid person will  laugh at this, the smart person will get this,  and then the wise person gets this. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw1z1sfy1yaj2z762thpt2t))

	- the world of logic. But I like yours better,  because I think people get that, [inaudible]  that better. Go through a couple of the apple  pies, where I believe, and I think you believe,  you should put up a huge stink, you should  put up a huge fuss because it's like  the not invented hear syndrome, right? People  aren't aware of how persuasive, or pervasive ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw2bwd31ekgg28xewpb9hm6))
		- **Note**: The author suggests that individuals are able to make better decisions than a group because they are able to use instinct, experience, and various inputs to make decisions without having to boil everything down to rational logic. Furthermore, in a group setting there is often immense pressure to do this and this can lead to worse decisions being made. Additionally, individuals do not have the same personal risk of pushing back on what is said, and so can make decisions without worrying about sounding smart.
	- oftentimes an individual  ends up making way better decisions than a group  does for the same decision. I think Rory's point  there was that, as an individual we are making  a decision, we are using instinct, we're using  various experience, various inputs, but we don't  necessarily have to then reframe it in terms of  
	  
	  completely rational viewpoints. Whereas in  a group setting, there is immense pressure  to boil everything down to the rational logic.  If it cannot be bulletproof, then it is not a  decision that we want to make, so therefore groups  end up making, at times, much worse decisions.

		- **Note**: Groups often make worse decisions than individuals.
	- Now let's add a third person in to the mix, and  let's say there were 10 other people listening,  including some really important people  at the company. This third person,  if this third person wanted to sound very  smart, they can ask a very simple question,  which is, do you have any data to support  that? That's it. Now, all of a sudden by asking  
	  
	  that question and stating those few words,  this third person has elevated themselves  in the eyes of the group. And all  of this happens under the surface,  we are not even aware that this is going on.  In fact, you and I will feel a little stupid  that we don't have a bulletproof answer  readily available for this question.  
	  
	  So it affects everybody, everybody  concerned. That is an apple pie position. The reason it's an apple pie position is, I'm  not saying data is bad, but I'm saying that  oftentimes these questions that are essentially  aimed as making us look smart and seem smart, are  unnecessary. In fact, if we address them,  we might actually be harming the mission,  then helping it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw2gwrbgkn9sctywbx8f0eq))

		- **Note**: People who get added to group thinking for their expertise and ability to rationalize a particular problem set can do more harm than good in trying to unlock simple decisions.
	- you cannot  produce data for every single thing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw2pppc4kf6x4gsss3qqagd))

	- Few other apple pie positions  is, we need to define the success metrics for  whatever is being discussed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw2nx9njy3rv0xn7sxvfbyx))

	- I've seen this at many fast growing  organizations, we say we have too many meetings.  Then when we remove some of the meetings, then  people say, "Well, we need to sync more often,  
	  
	  because we feel like we're out of sync." So you  go into this endless cycle of more meetings and  then cutting the meetings and then starting  them again ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw2s19m17e599a8ym6rkghg))

	- the  personal cost of pushing back is so high,  that almost nobody does it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw2ty5r6htqhtje81wvzsna))
	- when a company gets  too big, what happens if the person who's  ultimately in charge doesn't notice it  and prevent it, is the executives of that company  end up being in competition with each other  and not with, "Let's make a better product for  our clients. Let's give them a better answer for a  consultant. Let's do better in terms of the asset  management," and it just works for every category. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw317r2amxttv2a76jsmjry))

		- **Note**: When everyone's got a different agenda the focus steers away from what's actually important, like make a product better for their clients (or considering the best customer outcome).
	- Because it conversions  to the group, the committee, as opposed diverging.  Which is, if you really want to find really  interesting stuff, you've got to be willing to  go much further out on the tails, in my opinion. 
	  
	  That's risky. It's risky for all of the reasons  that you cite the apple pie ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw35y21abaq81vsqm8ewv9j))
		- **Tags**: #[[divergent thinking]]
	- That resonates so much, because I've made this  observation in the past about certainty theater.  Because a lot of what's going on around us,  and this is not just in the business world,  this is so common in news and current events,  where we are basically engaging in certainty  theater. Everybody is certain about everything. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw394n8gy4b284ab4n9rab6))
		- **Note**: Blind certainty in the world around us
	- I am at a high  stakes meeting, making a high stakes proposal,  my competence in most organizations,  the vast majority of organizations,  is measured by the degree of certainty I  express for everything that I'm proposing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw3aapvbd3ws8t0bp6nwdj0))
	- "If  I don't come off as certain, I'm going to come  off as wishy washy, or I'm going to come off  as not committed." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw3e2agvpn56sxsmqxvgn9h))

	- There's a lot that you have to try to  control for the variables, but there are some  things that you've got to learn as they happen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw3h9pxtqyfw4sxjtw88yj6))

	- human behavior is at its fundamental core,  emotional. Most explanations are given post hoc  and they are given with a veneer of rationality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw3kb7kfz6zdrcneczbbw29))
		- **Tags**: #[[human behaviour]]
	- What you want to do, is you want to focus on  minimizing the opportunity costs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw3qnhy81c647z38ej3sg89))

	- When you get these short feedback loops, it  starts to affect how you think about things. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw3sqaeyq8st9b69fgea0pt))

	- It reminded me of William Blake, who I like very  much. His quote was, "I must create a system  of my own or be enslaved by another man's." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw3te2svr4ppnpv5p3ejp6c))
