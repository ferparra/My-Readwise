	- Building a big project: a new product, a major redesign,... 
	  
	  2 weeks at a time is nibbling and wandering. It drags on and on with no end.
	  
	  Planning a whole six months+ is fortune telling: always turns out wrong.
	  
	  In between?
	  
	  Factoring. Decomposing. Orthogonalizing. 1/n
	- Factoring / Decomposition / Orthogonality ... whatever you call it ... is breaking the work according to the ANATOMY of the work, not two-week nibbles.
	  
	  When we define six-week projects, we define what “done” means, what “shippable” means, for a separable unit of the whole.
