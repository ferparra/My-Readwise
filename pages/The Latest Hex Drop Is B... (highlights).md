	- The latest Hex drop is both a feature (embedding apps and individual cells, everywhere) and an invitation to join the no-screenshots-of-charts club: https://t.co/JiKTRyLOvn ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_hex_tech/status/1486106341563265024))

	- It's now just as easy to embed a live, interactive, and always up-to-date chart from Hex as it is to copy and paste a screenshot of it https://t.co/WZ55h4Qvl7 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_hex_tech/status/1486106808187961345))
	- This should Just Workâ„¢ anywhere that supports iframes, and we have direct integrations with a number of tools that don't support iframes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_hex_tech/status/1486107858626220034))
	- And if you ever find yourself taking a screenshot of a chart to paste somewhere you can't seem to embed a Hex app, **literally call us** and we'll get right on it. You might have to leave a voicemail... but call anyway and maybe we can talk about SQL or something. (831) 246-6785. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_hex_tech/status/1486108262864879619))
