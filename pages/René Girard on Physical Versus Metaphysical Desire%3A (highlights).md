document_note:: René Girard explores the concept of physical and metaphysical desires, arguing that our desires for partners may be informed by people around us, rather than by our partners themselves. He explores the scapegoat mechanism and its role in creating social differences between people to prevent chaos, as well as Christianity's perspective on the victim. He also discusses the fetishization of science, contrarianism, and originality, and advises to withdraw in order to nurture the soul. He concludes by noting that his ideas are deeply morally ambivalent and can be paralyzing.

	- Girard's scapegoat mechanism:
	  
	  1. Mimetic contagion (descent into chaos)
	  
	  2. Scapegoating (blame, expel or murder a single victim)
	  
	  3. Deification (victim is deified into a God)
	  
	  4. Institutionalization (ritualization and re-enactment of the murder) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtg5tzktbwmavhgeyhyvrjw4))
		- **Note**: René Girard examines the difference between physical and metaphysical desires, the concept of the "Romantic Lie" and how we weaponize empathy and compassion. He also looks into how the scapegoat mechanism is a morally ambivalent process, how science being deified can lead to terrible political agendas, and how we ought to live in the end times. He concludes that Satan is the name for the mimetic process and that the victims most interesting to us are those who allow us to condemn our neighbors.
