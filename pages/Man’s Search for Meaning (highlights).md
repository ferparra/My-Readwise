document_note:: In Man's Search for Meaning, Frankl postulates that man must live for a meaning in order to be truly happy. He experienced this himself in a concentration camp, where he and other prisoners were able to retreat to an inner life of spiritual freedom. He found that the meaning of life could be found in three ways - creating a work or doing a deed, experiencing something or encountering someone, and by the attitude we take toward avoiding suffering. He also found that suffering can cease to be suffering when it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice. He concluded that mental health is based on tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish. Frankl's postscript is the case for a tragic optimism, which allows for turning suffering into a human achievement and accomplishment.

	- In a different connection, we have already spoken of the tendency there was to look into the past, to help make the present, with all its horrors, less real. But in robbing the present of its reality there lay a certain danger. It became easy to overlook the opportunities to make something positive of camp life, opportunities which really did exist. Regarding our "provincial existence" as unreal was in itself an important factor in causing the prisoners to lose their hold on life; everything in a way became pointless. Such people forgot that often it is just such an exceptionally difficult external situation which gives man the opportunity to grow spiritually beyond himself. Instead of taking the camp's difficulties as a test of their inner strength, they did not take their life seriously and despised it as something of no consequence. They preferred to close their eyes and to live in the past. Life for such people became meaningless ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4kjvkqtv2dvxjbp8mg1dp8))
		- **Note**: People in the concentration camp had a tendency to try to ignore their difficult experiences and pretend that their current situation wasn't real. This led people to miss opportunities to make something good out of their camp life, even though these opportunities existed. This made it harder for the prisoners to go on living because life seemed pointless. Instead of trying to use their inner strength to cope with the challenges of life in a concentration camp, some people chose to ignore it and think of it as unimportant. They would rather close their eyes and think of the past instead. This made life seem meaningless to them.

	- Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen not by caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run - in the long run, I say! - success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.

	- Does this not bring to mind the story of Death in Teheran? A rich and mighty Persian once walked in his garden with one of his servants. The servant cried that he had just encountered Death, who had threatened him. He begged his master to give him his fastest horse so that he could make haste and flee to Teheran, which he could reach that same evening. The master consented and the servant galloped off on the horse. On returning to his house the master himself met Death, and questioned him, "Why did you terrify and threaten my servant?" "I did not threaten him; I only showed surprise in still finding him here when I planned to meet him tonight in Teheran," said Death.
