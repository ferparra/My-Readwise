	- Story time! Highly requested:
	  
	  Once upon a time we were working on an EVM to OVM transpiler. After weeks of intense EVM debugging we realized this level of abstraction could easily get us 90% of the way there, but the last 10% would be monumental. We needed a different approach. https://t.co/R9l1v1SQG9
	- Unfortunately, this realization came as we were coming up against a high pressure deadline, and we weren't sure how to allocate our dev firepower. We asked around for help within the Solidity community but most people had their plates full already.
	- I suggested broadening our search and going harder on finding someone who could help but @ben_chain cautioned me that it would be near impossible - very few people were EVM *and* compiler experts. To make it even more impossible, we had very little time.
	- Stressed and exhausted, we tried to cheer up at an outdoor restaurant. It was the first time we'd eaten out since COVID started, and as I looked around in awe, a familiar figure caught my eye. I poked @kevinjho_ and whispered, "Hey doesn't that guy look like Geohot?"
	- Kevin looked up at the man walking past our table & agreed, "Yeah he kinda does!"
	  
	  Before he could walk out of sight, I puffed out my chest and bellowed "GEORGE!!!"
	  
	  He stopped.
	  
	  "HOTZ!"
	  
	  He turned. The entire restaurant turned too. My teammates cringed, embarrassed for me.
	- Lo and behold, it *really was* none other than @realGeorgeHotz. We raised a plate of truffle fries to him and pulled up a chair. We introduced ourselves and our company, to which he responded:
	  
	  "Oh you're scaling Ethereum? Like with plasma and all that?"
	  
	  We were shocked!
	- We explained our new scaling design to him and he was intrigued. He proceeded to ask questions that displayed an intimate knowledge of Ethereum and the EVM. In a long shot, we asked him if he had any suggestions on how we might get our Solidity to OVM compiler done on time.
	- He looked at us pensively for a moment, and then smirked, "Well. How bad do you want it?"
	  
	  In this moment we realized the Universe is a simulation. George was driving autonomously through this game of Life and we now offered him a side quest.
	- His first day in the office, he simply sat in front of the computer and stared for hours. We hovered doubtfully around him.
	  
	  Then, three days later he handed over a stunningly elegant compiler. A 280 line diff to solc: https://t.co/wXWRT69yff
	- We asked him how he was able to pull it off, hoping his juju would rub off on us.
	  
	  "Well," he said, "You just gotta think. And then do it right."
	  
	  With his help, we hit our wildly ambitious deadlines.
	- Those days in the office were electric. After the 1st day of "thinking", George moved at superhuman speed. Every few hours he surpassed milestones that would take most skilled people days. 
	  
	  "I like proving things to myself" He'd say on occasion when we stared at him in disbelief
	- He reduced our stress tenfold. Gave us an injection of morale when it was low and we were overworked. 
	  
	  Most importantly, he reminded us that we were solving interesting problems and to have FUN doing it.
	  
	  And that... is the story of how George Hotz saved our asses!
