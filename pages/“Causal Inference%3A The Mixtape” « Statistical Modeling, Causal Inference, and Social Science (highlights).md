	- We can learn from natural experiments. In a natural experiment, the exposure is assigned externally so we don’t have to worry about selection bias. Many natural experiments have the form of a discontinuity. If so, there’s a potentially serious concern with lack of overlap of the exposed and control groups, inference will be sensitive to our model for the outcome given the assignment variable, so we should take that aspect of the model seriously. But the assignment variable should not be the only concern. The exposed and control groups can differ in other pre-treatment characteristics. . . .
