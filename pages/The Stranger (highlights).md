document_note:: The Stranger by Albert Camus tells the story of Meursault, an amoral man living in Algeria who refuses to believe that his lack of emotions and lack of belief in God should cause him despair. The novel explores Camus' notion of the absurdity of life and human existence, with Meursault's behavior being seen as threatening to society. Meursault's detached attitude and belief in the meaningless of life reflects Camus' own feelings and is a difficult concept for society to accept. The novel follows Meursault's journey through his trial, imprisonment and eventual death sentence, reflecting on the prosecution process and the idea that one can find a sort of compensation in the memories of life outside of prison.
