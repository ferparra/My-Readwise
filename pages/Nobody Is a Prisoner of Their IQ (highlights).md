	- The psychologist Arthur Jensen’s [definition](https://substack.com/redirect/1eec6fe5-62a2-40ce-8a2a-77ec82a3f245?j=eyJ1IjoiM3RtYiJ9.rWPgU1VVWcyQ-BEICiM79G4-ubmdfDcTfkWbvoNxB4A) of intelligence:
	  
	  > *“Assimilation of experience (i.e., learning) into cognitive structures which organize what has been learned in ways that subsequently permit quick and adequate retrieval and broad transfer of the learning in new relevant situations. Stated in simplest terms…the process of understanding what one has learned. It is ‘getting the idea,’ ‘catching on,’ having the ‘Aha!’ experience that may accompany or follow experiencing or learning something, and the relating of new learning to past learning and vice versa.”* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwak6wv1kds1v6cksx1afp2))
	- Intelligence is important, but it’s far from the only thing that matters for living a decent life. A [meta-analysis](https://substack.com/redirect/634320bf-2895-43ba-81e2-12c8db8e5150?j=eyJ1IjoiM3RtYiJ9.rWPgU1VVWcyQ-BEICiM79G4-ubmdfDcTfkWbvoNxB4A) of 23 studies found that at the individual level, intelligence has no relationship with happiness.

	- The psychologist and intelligence researcher Russell T. Warne [points out](https://substack.com/redirect/fa8c3c30-285f-443d-ab28-91370de94bd3?j=eyJ1IjoiM3RtYiJ9.rWPgU1VVWcyQ-BEICiM79G4-ubmdfDcTfkWbvoNxB4A) :
	  
	  > *“Although below-average intelligence makes life more difficult for a person, other traits or life circumstances can compensate for having a lower IQ. Having a supportive family, higher socioeconomic status, motivation, conscientiousness, cultural influences that discourage unfavorable behaviors, determination, and many other characteristics can compensate for a. lower level of intelligence. Nobody is a prisoner of their IQ.”* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwbe5kck1d9ddxj88f71t6m))
	- If you live in a developed country, studies indicate that there is a simple and highly effective formula for avoiding poverty:
	  
	  1. Finish high school.
	  
	  2. Get a full-time job once you finish school.
	  
	  3. Get married before you have children.
	  
	  This has come to be [known](https://substack.com/redirect/47bff34f-eca4-48d2-a2ab-9ca6e6d4e0b7?j=eyJ1IjoiM3RtYiJ9.rWPgU1VVWcyQ-BEICiM79G4-ubmdfDcTfkWbvoNxB4A) as “the success sequence.” Ninety-seven percent of people who follow these steps do not live in poverty. In contrast, seventy-six percent of those that did not adhere to any of these norms were poor. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwbeweg3z84ed6sfmkzeg4t))
	- Today, honesty, restraint, reliability, integrity, thrift, and decency are behaviors that are good for both individuals and their communities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwbfp9hc1xsvaf68b71e856))
	- In their book *Talent* , Tyler Cowen and Daniel Gross point out:
	  
	  > *“Personality and conscientiousness matter most at the bottom of the distribution…in the bottom tenth of earners, non-cognitive skills—which include, for instance, features of personality—matters two and a half to four times more than do cognitive skills.”* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwce5hxma4199jj5xhdngxd))

	- People respond to incentives. Status is an incentive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwbgc7s5gab5jk5e2mp5a8g))
	- And while intelligence is relatively unresponsive to status, people will change their behaviors in exchange for the approval and validation of others. One way to have a decent society is to make sure we confer status on functional and healthy behaviors. Behaviors that nearly anyone can accomplish regardless of their underlying abilities or dispositions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwbtps52mkzawwv75d7d31k))
	- There has been some criticism of the “success sequence,” notably, the fear that widespread knowledge of it will lead more people to blame people for being poor. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwbt70gtbc51tpyfmgqe0t9))
	- you shouldn’t blame people for problems they have no reasonable way to avoid. You shouldn’t hold them responsible if the solution is impossible or requires ceaseless abject misery ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwbt226bmjgm3q375wdbbj9))
	- The success sequence is not difficult to complete.
	  
	  Graduating high school is easy. American high schools have low standards, and teachers don’t want to fail anyone. Almost any student who puts in a little effort will graduate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwbsjc1fevv8k1909877g9w))
