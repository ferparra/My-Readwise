	- Rive's state machines let designers build real interactions (not just mockups or prototypes).
	  
	  We think this is an important creative aspect that is missing in modern workflows.ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/LlzslWIz16 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/guidorosso/status/1574532104708202496))

	- State machines make designers think more like developers, without having to write code.
	  
	  At the same time, they make it easy for developers to implement (just hook up the Rating property in this example)â€¦ https://t.co/Z7fXQzw0EI ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/guidorosso/status/1574532121384734720))
	- â€¦while designers are free to iterate as much as they want.
	  
	  Note that the Rating property stays the same, but the graphics and state machine can be wildly different. https://t.co/KrAxitMSTf ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/guidorosso/status/1574532155354464257))
	- Without a state machine, all this logic would need to be recreated in code. And each iteration would require a dev to update the code, which would need to be prioritized against other engineering efforts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/guidorosso/status/1574532159410343936))
