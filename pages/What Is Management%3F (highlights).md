	- Management is defined as:the art of getting things done through and with people in organized groups towards common objectivesa process of decision making and control over actions and activities for the purpose of attaining goalsa multipurpose organ that manages worker and work (Peter Drucker)knowing exactly what you want individual contributors to do and then seeing that they do it in the best and cheapest waya task of planning, organizing, directing, coordinating, motivating and controlling the efforts of others towards specific objectives
	- Management has a purpose. When the purpose is met, management is not needed anymore. Management is at the intersection of the working group, resources and stakeholders while the executing system is being set up. Over-managing creates inefficiencies. If it works, don’t fix it.

	- Risk management solutions should come bottom up – from the working group, or, if the manager is not prepared with a sound bottom-up solution, expectations holders(stakeholders) impose certain measures on the working group. This usually disrupts momentum and creates certain forms of inefficiencies.
