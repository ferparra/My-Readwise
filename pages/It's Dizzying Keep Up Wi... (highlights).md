	- It's dizzying keep up with BioML ðŸ§¬
	  
	  Not one, not two, but THREE exciting papers from the @MetaAI Protein Team before the end of the year.
	  
	  Here's what they released:

		- **Note**: Thread
	- First, in a collaboration with @UWproteindesign and
	  @sokrypton they asked the question: can protein language models extend natural proteins and actually serve as an engine for generative design?
	  
	  The answer is seemingly *yes*
	  
	  Epic explainer thread by @TomSercu. https://t.co/gsLgQ0ZKvy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ElliotHershberg/status/1606406964660932608))
	- Next, work led by @BrianHie on developing a programming language for protein design...
	  
	  The motivation here is to enable bioengineers to move up the ladder of abstraction, composing modular building blocks to achieve novel functions.
	  
	  Stunning work. https://t.co/zzKQ45g6me ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ElliotHershberg/status/1606406967492169728))
	- They also posted an updated version of their paper describing their work on ESM Atlas.
	  
	  If you missed it previously, this is the "large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins, with more than 617 million structures"
	  
	  Here's the original thread: https://t.co/a6JEpIoaQe ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ElliotHershberg/status/1606406970470060032))
	- Really impressive work to close out an incredible year for AI in protein science.
	  
	  Curious to see what 2023 holds...
	  
	  Happy holidays ðŸŽ„âœ¨ ðŸ§¬ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ElliotHershberg/status/1606406973259321344))
