	- "Starting a company is an asymmetric bet - if it works, will have tremendous upside, and if it doesnâ€™t, will still generate optionality.
	  
	  In starting a company, weâ€™re capping our downside and in joining a corporate weâ€™re capping our upside."

	- I keep reminding myself about my own job description as CEO and pull out of the day-to-day as much as I can to:
	  
	  1. Set a vision and strategy.
	  2. Get the money to execute.
	  3. Hire the team to execute.
	  4. Hold the team accountable.
	  5. Evangelise the vision. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/batkomichael/status/1592723494462115840))
