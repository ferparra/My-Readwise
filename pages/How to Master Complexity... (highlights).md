	- How to master complexity and problem solving in [[science]] and [[engineering]]?
	  
	  Build insight and understanding first, so that you do not drown in [[complexity]].
	  
	  Approximations foster understanding.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- There are the two broad ways to master complexity: organize the complexity or discard it.
	  
	  First, try organizing complexity either by dividing hard problems into manageable pieces or founding transferable/reusable ideas. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/status/1444161758608850954))
	- 1. [[Divide and Conquer]]
	  
	  As imperial rulers knew, you need not conquer all your enemies at once. Instead, conquer them one at a time.
	  
	  No problem is too difficult. Dissolve hard problems into smaller pieces.
	  
	  Divide and conquer is a universal solvent for scientific problems. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/status/1444161759741296646))
	- 2. [[Abstraction]]
	  
	  An abstraction gets its power from its [[reusability]].
	  
	  It connects seemingly random details into a higher-level structure that allows us to transfer [[knowledge]] and [[insights]].
	  
	  By building abstractions, you amplify your [[intelligence]]. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/status/1444161760802471936))
	- When these tools are not enough and problems are still too complex, try to discard complexity without loosing information.
	  
	  The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/status/1444161761993629696))
	- 3. [[Symmetry]] and Conservation
	  
	  In the midst of change, find what does not change.
	  
	  By finding asymmetry or an invariant, you simplify [[complex problems]]. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/status/1444161763046424582))
	- 4. Proportional Reasoning
	  
	  Focus your attention on how one quantity determines another.
	  
	  By guiding you toward what is often the most important characteristic of a problem, the scaling exponent, it helps you discard spurious complexity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/status/1444161764094988291))
	- 5. Dimensional Analysis
	  
	  As [[Socrates]] might have put it, the uncompared quantity is not worth knowing.
	  
	  Rewrite relations in dimensionless form.
	  
	  The space of dimensionless relations is much smaller than the space of all possible relations, this rewriting simplifies many problems. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/status/1444161765198098435))
	- Finally, if the phenomenon still resists understanding, simplify.
	  
	  When the going gets tough, the tough lower their standards. 
	  
	  Approximate first, and worry later.
	  
	  Otherwise you never start. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/status/1444161766334742528))
	- 6. Lumping
	  
	  To simplify [[complex problems]], round or lump complicated numbers and graphs.
	  
	  Curves become straight lines, calculus becomes algebra, and even quantum mechanics becomes comprehensible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/status/1444161767462998023))
	- 7. Probabilistic Reasoning
	  
	  Probability is a degree of belief.
	  
	  A probability is based on our knowledge, it changes when our knowledge changes.
	  
	  Use it when your information is incomplete or when you have discarded even the chance or the wish to collect the missing information. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/status/1444161768486359046))
	- 8. Easy Cases
	  
	  A correct analysis works in all casesâ€”including the simplest ones. 
	  
	  Therefore, look at the easy cases first.
	  
	  Often, we can completely solve a problem simply by understanding the easy cases. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/status/1444161769560100867))
	- For long-lasting learning and understanding, make bonds; connect each new fact and idea to what you already know.
	  
	  This way of thinking will help you learn in one year what can take twenty.
	  
	  Use your reasoning tools to weave a richly connected, durable tapestry of knowledge. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/status/1444161770608685058))
	- An analogy for the value of connected knowledge is an infinite two-dimensional lattice: a percolation lattice.
	  
	  Every dot marks a piece of knowledge.
	  
	  As the number of bounds increases, it unifies an ever-larger fraction of the lattice of knowledge (in bold, the largest cluster).
