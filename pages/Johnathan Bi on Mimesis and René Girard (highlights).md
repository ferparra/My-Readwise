	- Philosophy - The API Document of the Human Soul
	  
	  Summary:
	  I wanted to sort of debug myself in the same way that I was taught to Debug applications, and that philosophy was the API document of the human soul. So that's how I got into philosophy. One is Buddhism, maybe we'll get to that today. The other strand is a group of continental social theorists called the recognition theorists. And there's really three traditions here: Scottish moral tradition with with human Smith; German tradition, most notably Hegel,. French tradition with Rousseau and include Gerard as well.

	  I started getting to coding when I was 14, 15. I ended up getting a full ride to Columbia to study CS. And, you know, part of the problem of going to an elite school, especially someone who's interested in computer science is that there's a sort of Zuckerberg complex and everyone's trying to drop out as fast as possible to raise some money. And so I did a pretty good job. I dropped out my freshman spring raised a small friends and family startup ended up crashing and burning. And, you know, the defeat was so total and internal that I was really forced to introspect, coming from an engineering and mathematical background. I wanted to sort of debug myself in the same way that I was taught to debug applications, and that philosophy was the API document of the human soul, if you will. So that's how I got into philosophy. I was really interested in really two strands of theorists. One is Buddhism, maybe we'll bucket that maybe we'll get to that today. The other strand is a group of continental social theorists called the, or what my professors like to call the recognition theorists. And there's really three traditions here. One tradition is the Scottish moral tradition with with human Smith. And the German tradition, most notably Hegel, and obviously the French tradition with Rousseau and include Gerard in there as well. And I think what's unique about all of these ([Time 0:01:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/547aa283-fd6a-4006-8cd9-15e93bde238a))
	- What Is Memetic Theory?
	  
	  Summary:
	  Memetic theory is the consequence of our social nature. We smile when our parents smile as a newborn, we stick out our tongue when they stick out their tongue and copying is clearly an important part of learning. It's a former practice. But Gerard kind of took it a little further than that. So what is what is memetic theory, and that Gerard postulated is the, I would say the consequence ofOur social nature.

	  Recent episode with Agnes Caller that has not aired yet so you have not heard of Jonathan but she starts off by saying that we start off pretty ignorant of the world. We don't know enhances a manual. And the first thing we do is we copy, we smile when our parents smile as a newborn, when a few months into our lives, we stick out our tongue when they stick out their tongue and copying is clearly an important part of learning. It's a former practice. But Gerard kind of took it a little further than that. So what is what is memetic theory, and that Gerard postulated is the, I would say the consequence of our social nature.

	- What Is the Beautiful?
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Now, what seems as an innocuous suggestion, I really think to be one of the greatest attacks mounted against the foundations of modern social theory, because it's fundamentally giving a completely different answer to the question where normative certainty is derived from. And I think modernity generally has two answers to this question. Well, first, the distinction I'm using is a perennial one between normative and descriptive. So descriptive is the color of that chair, the length of this table, how many fingers I have. And these are things that philosophers think we usually independently have access to, by our own investigations. But when you go to the normative side, what is the beautiful, what is the good, what type of sexual familial relations are laudable and what are despicable. That seems to be a different fundamentally type of object than the length of tables and chairs, or at least philosophers have commonly sought those. And I think modernity really has two answers to the question. Where does normative certainty, how do we access normative truth? And I think one is offered by the Enlightenment, and the answer there is reason, right, and our core institution of free speech is grounded upon this by mill, that through our investigations, each of us as individuals filtering through our own reason can come to our own understanding.

	- I've Never Heard of Gerard
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  I think Gerard is the kind of thinker, and I confess to listeners I've never read Gerard. I've only watched your first part of your seven-part lecture series. I found it fascinating. I've heard of Gerard, but he's the kind of thinker that when I was younger, I would say, it's a bunch of nonsense. There's nobody's talking about it. It's a bunch of grand theories. But as I've gotten older, I find them much more provocative. And certainly long-term listeners of the entire talk will note that Adam Smith, who said, man, naturally desires not only to be loved, but to be lovely. That is, we want respect, and we want honor, and we want praise from the people around us, and we want to gain it authentically, which is a little bit of not so as Gerard is the first part.

	- Adam Smith Is Not Impartial
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  That person has the same values as that culture, which are not necessarily Smith. But he's just might aspire to that, Smith might want the approval of that group that he's immersed himself in. Right. And so that group is not impartial. That group has a whole bunch of prejudices and a whole bunch of values. And Smith is of course doing his best. I feel terrible saying this about Adam Smith. He's doing his best to try to appease them and to get their approval. And I think Smith would find that offensive, which is, I think, the Smith I represented in my book. And I think it's interesting, I think, Gerard would suggest that we could think all he wants about how he's not going to give into all what they want. And he has his own views. He's going to be drawn to them like a moth to a light bulb and he's going to give in. He's not. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, that's right. And I'll mention one more point on this point. And then we should move on to authenticity and eventually the intellectual history. There's so much to talk about. There actually, if we take what I like about this impartial spectator view that we sort of simulate, if you will, sort of a person, a normative judge in the back of our heads, is that there's potentially a biological basis for this in the 20th century discovery of mirror neurons. Right. And these are neurons that both fire when you do an action or when you observe a similar action being done. ([Time 0:16:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9030fac1-1512-49c8-a93f-e89d2455b72d))

	- Machiavelli and the Ends of Reason
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* There is a means of reason, which is the ability to have discussions like this, and an ends of reason, which is contemplative joy., * There is a means of spirit, which is mimisis or imitation, and an ends of spirit, which is social goods like social belonging, recognition, and glory.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Through creation, having a roof over our heads. And there's also a means of reason, right? That's just, well, reason itself, right? Our ability to have discussions like this. But, funnily enough, there's actually an ends of reason, too. And that's contemplative joy. And this is the thing that's going to be obscured. There is a means of spirit. Maybe that's mimisis or imitation. Plato's been unclear. But there's also an ends of spirit. And that end of spirit is all these social goods that we've discussed, right? Thumos, glory, recognition, social belonging. And this intellectual history really sees authors of antiquity. Obviously, Aristotle who continued this, right? Zuan Politikon, humans are social political creatures that continued all the way to the Christian natural law theorists who saw a fundamental end, fundamental ends, not just an instrumental means of the good human life to be participation in the community itself. Okay? So the social participation was the end or was one of the most important ends. Now, my professor sees the radical break between the social history in Machiavelli, who saw people as fundamentally egocentric and most importantly, for him, social participation for the ruler was not the end in itself. It was not the joy to be seeked. It was merely an instrumental means for appetite, for the ends of appetite, for self-preservation. Does that make sense? Did you see how the ends of spirit have been obscured? ([Time 0:38:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/72bf7cab-8a45-4853-a6e9-21654523ee6e))

	- The Future of Economics: A Discussion of the Social Dimension
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Economics will shift away from a competitive model in the 21st century., * This shift will be due to the increasing technological advancements of the 21st century.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  As you get, that is to say, once our core human ends are satisfied and they're quite easy satisfied, red food, water, shelter. Most economic decision making. I think actually comes from this social dimension that doesn't lend itself very easily to mathematical modeling. And the last thing I'll say is this. I think as we become more and more materially prosperous, more and more of our economy is going to be driven by spirit and less and less of it is going to be driven by appetite. That is to say, more and more of it is going to approximate cryptocurrencies or people buying skins on world of warcraft than it is me bartering three chickens for your duck because I'm out of my last leg and my wife is going to die if I don't give her milk, something like that. All this is to say is that when you have all three parts of the human soul, so to speak, in view, I think that economic, the logic of economics in the 21st century as we become more and more technologically advanced, it's going to shift away from this competitive model and more and more even if it even though it is already to a great degree, it's going to shift more and more after. And I think we're already in a somewhat post scarcity world in some sense. ([Time 0:57:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4ced70fa-a002-400d-8046-2eb348ee8612))
	- The Irrationality of Brexit
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* People can be irrational in their decisionmaking processes., * Brexit is an example of a decision that was made based on irrational factors., * The people who voted for Brexit may have been motivated by a sense of nationalism rather than an understanding of economics.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  No, I think that's exactly right. I mean, I think that's why, you know, to use an obvious example Brexit seemingly irrational right. Seemingly irrational people voting against their, I think it's really complicated on every dimension of this problem, but I'm going to give you the, I'm giving the caricature inversion. The caricature version is these, these, these people from England who voted to leave the European Union, they were, they were cutting up their nose despite their face. That's irrational. They're going to be poorer now and how's that going to help that? Obviously didn't understand the economics of what they were doing. And I look at it very differently now. I might have said that some version of that in the past, but I look at it very differently. I say, I'm going to assume actually that they do know the economics. They just care about something more than just about money. National sovereignty. They're a denity. Is it, is it English a person, a person said, a man? And we see this freezing. It's had everywhere around the world. It's not a British thing. It's not an American thing. It's in a lot of different places. People obviously have their sense of self is not unimportant. I don't know whether that's true or not, seems to be somewhat, somewhat related. I want to come back to your earlier critique of economics though, which is again straight out of some past econ talks. And it's also in my book, Wild Problems, which is that you talked about how being the pleasure or sense of self, the value I get from that gets tangled up in my utility and vice versa. Now, the utilitarian will say, and there's a common response to my argument, I'll also put it all in utility. You know, I'll get utility from who I am. I'll get utility from my sense of self. And as you can cram it in, I argue that it's just not that helpful after a while and certainly it's not helpful mathematically. But you know, this critique really comes from LA Paul, the philosopher and her vampire problem. ([Time 0:59:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9727ed90-017a-445e-9531-9f36b5a648d4))
