	- Philosophy - The API Document of the Human Soul
	  
	  Summary:
	  I wanted to sort of debug myself in the same way that I was taught to Debug applications, and that philosophy was the API document of the human soul. So that's how I got into philosophy. One is Buddhism, maybe we'll get to that today. The other strand is a group of continental social theorists called the recognition theorists. And there's really three traditions here: Scottish moral tradition with with human Smith; German tradition, most notably Hegel,. French tradition with Rousseau and include Gerard as well.

	  I started getting to coding when I was 14, 15. I ended up getting a full ride to Columbia to study CS. And, you know, part of the problem of going to an elite school, especially someone who's interested in computer science is that there's a sort of Zuckerberg complex and everyone's trying to drop out as fast as possible to raise some money. And so I did a pretty good job. I dropped out my freshman spring raised a small friends and family startup ended up crashing and burning. And, you know, the defeat was so total and internal that I was really forced to introspect, coming from an engineering and mathematical background. I wanted to sort of debug myself in the same way that I was taught to debug applications, and that philosophy was the API document of the human soul, if you will. So that's how I got into philosophy. I was really interested in really two strands of theorists. One is Buddhism, maybe we'll bucket that maybe we'll get to that today. The other strand is a group of continental social theorists called the, or what my professors like to call the recognition theorists. And there's really three traditions here. One tradition is the Scottish moral tradition with with human Smith. And the German tradition, most notably Hegel, and obviously the French tradition with Rousseau and include Gerard in there as well. And I think what's unique about all of these ([Time 0:01:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/547aa283-fd6a-4006-8cd9-15e93bde238a))
	- What Is Memetic Theory?
	  
	  Summary:
	  Memetic theory is the consequence of our social nature. We smile when our parents smile as a newborn, we stick out our tongue when they stick out their tongue and copying is clearly an important part of learning. It's a former practice. But Gerard kind of took it a little further than that. So what is what is memetic theory, and that Gerard postulated is the, I would say the consequence ofOur social nature.

	  Recent episode with Agnes Caller that has not aired yet so you have not heard of Jonathan but she starts off by saying that we start off pretty ignorant of the world. We don't know enhances a manual. And the first thing we do is we copy, we smile when our parents smile as a newborn, when a few months into our lives, we stick out our tongue when they stick out their tongue and copying is clearly an important part of learning. It's a former practice. But Gerard kind of took it a little further than that. So what is what is memetic theory, and that Gerard postulated is the, I would say the consequence of our social nature.

	- What Is the Beautiful?
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Now, what seems as an innocuous suggestion, I really think to be one of the greatest attacks mounted against the foundations of modern social theory, because it's fundamentally giving a completely different answer to the question where normative certainty is derived from. And I think modernity generally has two answers to this question. Well, first, the distinction I'm using is a perennial one between normative and descriptive. So descriptive is the color of that chair, the length of this table, how many fingers I have. And these are things that philosophers think we usually independently have access to, by our own investigations. But when you go to the normative side, what is the beautiful, what is the good, what type of sexual familial relations are laudable and what are despicable. That seems to be a different fundamentally type of object than the length of tables and chairs, or at least philosophers have commonly sought those. And I think modernity really has two answers to the question. Where does normative certainty, how do we access normative truth? And I think one is offered by the Enlightenment, and the answer there is reason, right, and our core institution of free speech is grounded upon this by mill, that through our investigations, each of us as individuals filtering through our own reason can come to our own understanding.
