	- **Logic** is the study of correct [reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason). It includes both [formal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic) and [informal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_logic).

	- complex propositions are made up of simpler propositions linked to each other by [propositional connectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective) like ∧ {\displaystyle \land } ![\land ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d6823e5a222eb3ca49672818ac3d13ec607052c4) (and) or → {\displaystyle \to } ![\to ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1daab843254cfcb23a643070cf93f3badc4fbbbd) (if...then).

	- Arguments can be either correct or incorrect. An argument is correct if its premises support its conclusion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyx5aeqgq8nr4zdq39c4mt4))
	- Systems of logic are theoretical frameworks for assessing the correctness of reasoning and arguments. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyx5kb1ctqjdntb7kdxth1p))
	- While Aristotelian logic focuses on reasoning in the form of [syllogisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism), in the modern era its traditional dominance was replaced by [classical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic), a set of fundamental logical intuitions shared by most logicians. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyx5ywz9ne6gnt5c3kb3v0n))
	- *Premises* and *conclusions* are the basic parts of inferences or arguments and therefore play a central role in logic. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyx6jrfk5x705t8npe7m7ep))
	- [Truth tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table) can be used to show how logical connectives work or how the truth of complex propositions depends on their parts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyx7g7cc4d2b7vrz82p08s2))
	- A *deductively [valid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(logic)) argument* is one whose premises guarantee the truth of its conclusion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyx846br5vqqb37af8tssj9))
	- Aristotelian logic encompasses a great variety of topics, including [metaphysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics) theses about [ontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology) categories and problems of scientific explanation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyxa7b4c3zpwapghwk4f76p))
	- Syllogisms are characterized by the fact that the premises are linked to each other and to the conclusion by sharing one predicate in each case. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyxbk1ssmqcjsf33ps11cag))
	- the syllogism "all men are mortal; [[Socrates]] is a man; therefore [[Socrates]] is mortal" is valid. The syllogism "all cats are mortal; Socrates is mortal; therefore Socrates is a cat", on the other hand, is invalid. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyxb6b8htmc533qaef6zpv2))

	- First-order logic includes the same propositional connectives as propositional logic but differs from it because it articulates the internal structure of propositions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyxc6p42n2b3tq9neg95tp7))
	- Many extended logics take the form of modal logic by introducing modal operators. Modal logics were originally developed to represent statements about necessity and possibility. For instance the modal formula ◊ P {\displaystyle \Diamond P} ![\Diamond P](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c11ced51ad343c329a468b33e5139a99306fd0b6) can be read as "possibly P {\displaystyle P} ![P](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) " while ◻ P {\displaystyle \Box P} ![\Box P](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d30b6d37f2d650ad3011989f5477df0536bed7d1) can be read as "necessarily P {\displaystyle P} ![P](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) ". Modal logics can be used to represent different phenomena depending on what *flavor* of necessity and possibility is under consideration.

	- Higher-order logics extend classical logic not by using modal operators but by introducing new forms of quantification. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyxce4441gsr9qxex7ftqce))
	- In 1854, George Boole published *[The Laws of Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laws_of_Thought)*,[[192]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic#cite_note-196) introducing symbolic logic and the principles of what is now known as Boolean logic. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyxeks6rdyxn8evcw9sd213))
	- From 1910 to 1913, [Alfred North Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead) and [[Bertrand Russell]] published *[Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica)*[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic#cite_note-Principia-148) on the foundations of mathematics, attempting to derive mathematical truths from [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom) and [inference rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference_rule) in symbolic logic. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyxf7nqfzqzjsnjrpbtpmba))
	- n 1931, [Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del) raised serious problems with the foundationalist program and logic ceased to focus on such issues. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyxfdpfq3wzxhsbgdm22fxg))
