	- There were two inflationary decades over the past century: the 1940's and 1970's.
	  
	  Those two decades also saw the biggest reductions in wealth concentration of the century (i.e. bottom 90%'s share of wealth went up, top 0.1%'s share of wealth went down). https://t.co/qwUf8STVjt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/search?q=There%20were%20two%20inflationary%20decades%20over%20the%20past%20century%3A%20the%201940%27s%20and%201970%27s.%20%20Those%20two%20decades%20also%20saw%20the%20biggest%20reductions%20in%20wealth%20concentration%20of%20the%20century%20%28i.e.%20bottom%2090%25%27s%20share%20of%20wealth%20went%20up%2C%20top%200.1%25%27s%20share%20of%20weal%20%28from%3A%40LynAldenContact%29))

	- Emotional investing is rarely good investing. 
	  
	  I wouldn't want an emotional engineer designing a bridge, nor would I want an emotional manager running money. 
	  
	  If you're emotional about an investment, your position size might be too big or too small for your financial goals. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1373074164551147520))
	- The net international investment position of a country represents foreign assets they own, minus domestic assets held by foreigners. It's their national balance sheet as a debtor or creditor country. 
	  
	  Here's the NIIP % of GDP chart as of year-end 2020:

	- Inflation-adjusted interest rates for cash equivalents are currently in the -4% to -5% range after having been negative to varying degrees for most of the past decade, so no wonder people are playing with meme stocks and dog-themed tokens. 
	  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

	- It's a good idea to follow some people you disagree with. Otherwise you risk ending up in an echo chamber.
	  
	  Resist the temptation to tribalize and segment yourself, and instead focus on building connections and strength-testing your ideas. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1408512329789198340))
	- @paulinthedesert Yields don't necessarily rise with inflation, especially when they are held down by policy and collateral shortages. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1411047881423966208))
	- The arguments that people use are a reflection of their knowledge and character.
	  
	  I always appreciate a good counterargument if I can tell it's from a knowledgeable, intellectually honest source.
	  
	  Stress test your ideas, discuss them, and be able to argue the opposite side. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1421168621250830337))
	- $BTC and $TSLA have been more correlated than most other assets over the past two years, including more than the other $ARKK holdings. 
	  
	  I've been bullish on $BTC and not particularly on $TSLA.

	- There were a lot of reasons for That 70s Inflation, but one of the key reasons was that US oil production structurally topped out for geological reasons. 
	  
	  This was a hard constraint to deal with.

	- @INArteCarloDoss Virtual reality and gaming in general, but you can take assets from one world to another world, or otherwise have them recognized there too, since they have a verification mechanism that extends beyond any particular publisher.
	  
	  But also like, we can go outside and stuff. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1455658357138788353))
	- The US has gotten the official unemployment rate and jobless claims back down to normal levels. 
	  
	  And yet, 4 million fewer people are working than at the start of 2020, and the US has a lower labor force participation rate than Japan.
	  
	  It's an odd mix. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1464794027610488832))
	- It's challenging to overstate how crazy this chart is, which is why I keep referencing and updating it.

	- Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) advocates in general seem to have 1) overestimated the disinflationary forces in the US and developed world economies and 2) overestimated politicians' ability to reign in budget deficits if inflation does start to occur. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1507725684751355919))
	- As a reminder, it is historically very hard for US corporate profits to grow when the dollar is strong.
	  
	  The DXY down move in 2021 along with stimulus was helpful, but now with the dollar spiking and stimulus gone, there's little reason to expect great earnings reports overall.

	- Seek out people who disagree with you.
	  
	  Understand their arguments and point of view.
	  
	  And then "Steelman" their point of view, meaning to construct the strongest possible version of their argument and analyze it.
	  
	  Otherwise, what are doing here? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1520160903634862080))
	- @MacroAlf People mix up mean and median.
	  
	  Top 10% balance sheets look fine, and represent the majority of net worth. Bottom 90% balance sheets not so much.
	  
	  Putting an average on it misses what is happening with the majority of households. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1523396514101403648))
	- My latest article is a post-mortem of the Terra/Luna crash:

	- @rekurencja No, I think holding most or all in bitcoin with a 2-year period would be too risky.
	  
	  The problem with dollars in a developing country with a currency crisis is 1) how do you access them and 2) where do you store them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1592271364961861632))
	- I'm actually shocked by the majority of the answers to this thread.
	  
	  Many people assumed that everyone in a developing country with an active currency crisis has 1) a brokerage account with access to global securities and 2) can trust their local banks to hold dollars for them. https://t.co/lywKtieXpE ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1592278982166450176))
