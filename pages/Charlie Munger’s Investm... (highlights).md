	- 1. Risk
	  
	  Risk is at the core of every investment opportunity.
	  
	  And when Munger talks about risk, he doesn‚Äôt mean volatility.
	  
	  He talks about the possibility of permanent loss.
	  
	  Value Investors like him invest where the downside potential is the lowest. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1525875953045540865))
	- Not where the potential upside is the highest.
	  
	  Assessing the downside is part of your analysis.
	  
	  The keyword here is conservatism.
	  
	  Additionally, you need to insist on a margin of safety to protect you against unforeseen events (micro-and macro).

	- 2. Independence
	  
	  Investors who decide to not just buy an index fund mostly do so to outperform.
	  
	  Yet, if they listen to the broad consensus of analysts, financial reporters, etc. they perform mediocre anyways.
	  
	  To achieve extraordinary returns, your decisions must be different. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1525875960511447040))
	- Independent thinking and the confidence to stand with your decisions are essential for outperformance.
	  
	  If you‚Äôre right or wrong isn‚Äôt decided by what others think but by how the future plays out.
	  
	  And no one knows how that's gonna be.

	- 3. Preparation
	  
	  The only way to be confident in your (contrarian) decisions is to know they‚Äôre based on facts and proper research.
	  
	  So you got to put in the work, digging through 10Ks, Reports, Interviews, etc.
	  
	  The goal is to answer every ‚Äúwhy‚Äù you come up with.

	- 4. Intellectual Humility
	  
	  Inevitably, there will be questions you can‚Äôt answer and things you don‚Äôt understand.
	  
	  The beautiful thing about investing is that you don‚Äôt need to understand everything.
	  
	  If something doesn‚Äôt fit your circle of competence, move on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1525875973824163845))
	- The important thing is to notice when that‚Äôs the case.
	  
	  There is no easier way to lose money than to fool yourself into thinking you know something you don‚Äôt.
	  
	  It‚Äôs very easy to convince yourself of things that are simply not so.
	  
	  Resist that urge.

	- 5. Analytic Rigor
	  
	  Although we all have the same numbers to work with, investors come up with many different conclusions.
	  
	  In most cases, they‚Äôre far beyond what the numbers actually tell us.
	  
	  Focus on the basics and see what the business really has to offer.

	- 6. Allocation
	  
	  Capital allocation is one of the most important subjects for any investor.
	  
	  Instead of relying on stable discount rates or economic outlooks, investors should focus on opportunity costs.
	  
	  The best investment is always found in comparison to other options.

	- 7. Decisiveness
	  
	  Also, when an opportunity comes up, not investing enough is just as wrong as not investing at all.
	  
	  Following this checklist and other criteria will make you say no to most investments.
	  
	  So the ones that ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù this process deserve a significant investment.

	- 8. Patience
	  
	  Patience is one of the hardest to follow principles on here.
	  
	  Today‚Äôs markets and the easy access to them almost push us to quick and emotional trades.
	  
	  Once again, the best way to avoid this behavior lies in your research and analysis work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1525875997329047553))
	- You have a thesis for why you‚Äôre buying, that thesis is the only thing that should result in any form of action.
	  
	  If it plays out, do nothing.
	  
	  If things don‚Äôt go as expected, reassess and, if necessary, sell.
	  
	  Stock prices or some macro forecasts shouldn‚Äôt be a call to action.

	- 9. Change
	  
	  Your analysis is always, at least to some degree, dependent on estimates about the future.
	  
	  Things that you cannot know.
	  
	  And there are many uncontrollable reasons why those things turn out differently than you expect. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MnkeDaniel/status/1525876004438302721))
	- In that case, be honest to yourself. 
	  
	  Having mistakes in your thesis is inevitable, the real mistake would be to ignore them.
	  
	  Accept reality as it is and act accordingly.

	- 10. Focus
	  
	  We just talked about accepting reality even when things don‚Äôt work out as expected.
	  
	  A lot of focus is needed to spot those changes in the first place.
	  
	  Your thesis rarely gets one big hit.
	  
	  Far more often, small changes will impact the course of the company.
