1. What key lessons can be learned from Cyrus's leadership style?
2. How does Cyrus's approach to decision-making differ from other leaders?
3. How does Cyrus's example of humility inform our understanding of leadership today?

Xenophon's telling of Cyrus the Great, King of Persia, highlights his amazing accomplishments and leadership. Through real-life examples, Cyrus displays principles that are still applicable today in any field, such as how to conduct meetings, become an expert negotiator, deal efficiently with allies, appeal to others' self-interests, and inspire the highest standards of performance. He also stresses the importance of self-reliance, humility in success, and understanding that loyalty is gained through self-interest. His goal was to be the most benignly powerful person, not the richest, and to share riches rather than hoard them. Ultimately, Cyrus teaches that true leadership is making people all that they ought to be.
