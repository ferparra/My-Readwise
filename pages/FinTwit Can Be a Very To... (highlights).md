	- FinTwit can be a very toxic place, but it's undoubtedly a very valuable source for global macro insights.
	  
	  These are 20 macro FinTwit accounts I follow and learn from every day.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- One word before we start with the list.
	  
	  The common trait of these accounts is that they combine their knowledge of macro with great communication skills and most importantly...they are nice people - a breath of fresh air on FinTwit, really.
	  
	  Ok, let's go.

	- Let's start with secular macro trends.
	  
	  The first name won't surprise many: @LynAldenContact.
	  
	  Lyn is very skilled at connecting long-term macro dots and has fantastic communication skills - an excellent resource for big picture macro across the board.

	- Eric (@EPBResearch) is one of the most underrated accounts here.
	  
	  Excellent data-driven framework that he can translate into both cyclical and secular actionable macro analysis - and a true gentleman, which is a rarity on FinTwit.
	  
	  4/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937849283690498))
	- If you are interested in understanding how the US Dollar interacts with our economic system, Brent (@SantiagoAuFund) is your guy.
	  
	  His milkshake theory is widely known, but his knowledge extends further beyond that.
	  
	  A must follow here on FinTwit.
	  
	  5/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937850894258176))
	- Experience is always valuable, and Michael (@UrbanKaoboy) has plenty but his views are always bringing a fresh perspective and tons of educational content.
	  
	  Follow him for very valuable long-form threads on everything macro.
	  
	  6/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937852483948546))
	- Mark (@mark_dow) was involved in policymaking and ran money too: quite an interesting mix that brings a lot to the macro discussion table.
	  
	  His takes on the behavioral aspects of macro are very interesting too.
	  
	  7/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937854136504320))
	- Moving to cyclical macro now: understanding the turning points in cycles is crucial for asset allocation.
	  
	  I must start with another hugely underrated account: @MrBlonde_macro.
	  
	  I have talked to all the most known strategists in Wall Street and he's way better - enough said.
	  
	  8/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937855717756928))
	- Another excellent person for cyclical macro takes is @MichaelKantro.
	  
	  Very generous in sharing his data-driven framework, he is also very open and transparent about market calls.
	  
	  His HOPE approach is interesting to follow.
	  
	  9/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937857332469763))
	- Talking about underrated accounts: Patrick! (@PPGMacro).
	  
	  If you ask anybody running serious money in London, they'd generally know who PPG is  - Patrick brings a wealth of macro experience and very nice charts.
	  
	  10/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937858947358721))
	- The guys behind @prometheusmacro are another must follow: a US focused, data-driven approach that covers every angle of the macro cycle and systematizes everything in a portfolio allocation strategy.
	  
	  11/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937860549500928))
	- Of course my buddy @AndreasSteno gets a mention: FX, rates, commodities, equities...you name it.
	  
	  Andreas is a hard, hard worker who delivers a tons of valuable content across the macro spectrum.
	  
	  12/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937862139187202))
	- When it comes to applying cyclical macro framework to markets, all of the above accounts are super solid but I particularly like Brent (@donnelly_brent).
	  
	  Having ran large risks at banks, Brent has an excellent risk management approach and very interesting trade ideas.
	  
	  13/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937863695302658))
	- Another excellent account for cyclical macro takes that can be turned into investment ideas is @GreekFire23.
	  
	  I love his understanding of the incentive schemes driving Central Bankers around the world, and how he doesn't ''chase screens'' but sticks to the plan.
	  
	  14/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937865310113792))
	- Michael (@profplum99) is another authority when it comes to implementing cyclical macro views and analyzing risk/rewards across asset classes.
	  
	  His CV speaks for itself.
	  
	  15/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937866924826630))
	- It's Fed watchers time!
	  
	  Honorable mentions are very obvious here: Danielle (@DiMartinoBooth) is incredibly talented at understanding what's the likely path ahead for the Fed also given her past insider experience.
	  
	  And she is an egregious communicator.
	  
	  16/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937868510281731))
	- Obviously, Jim (@biancoresearch) is up there when it comes to reading the leaves of Federal Reserve policymaking.
	  
	  His charts are also very telling and informative.
	  
	  17/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937870087393280))
	- Moving to EU Central Bank watchers (but also broad macro profiles), @darioperkins stands out.
	  
	  He speaks BoE and ECB language fluently and can translate policy action into relevant macro takes.
	  
	  18/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937871626657799))
	- Of course, none of the above is useful if you don't really understand money and monetary mechanics.
	  
	  FinTwit's got your back there too.
	  
	  Joseph (@FedGuy12) will guide you towards the intricacies of the Fed balance sheet operations and monetary plumbing in an excellent way.
	  
	  19/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937873266704386))
	- Cullen (@cullenroche) periodically writes absolutely excellent and opinionated articles trying to debunk myths about money.
	  
	  Must follow for all things money.
	  
	  20/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937874835382272))
	- Few can explain banking and monetary mechanics as good as @Frances_Coppola - I learn something new every time she posts something on this topic.
	  
	  @KimDriver11 is another hugely underrated account - a true master in monetary mechanics.
	  
	  21/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937876370489346))
	- Last but not least: commodity specialists.
	  
	  There I'd go with 2 names:
	  
	  1) @DoombergT: if you don't understand commodities after reading his pieces, it's your fault :)
	  
	  22/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937877939085314))
	- Tracy (@chigrl) has a very deep understanding of commodities and particularly of energy markets.
	  
	  Following her will ensure you are up to speed with anything relevant happening in the space - and you'd better be nowadays!
	  
	  23/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1563937879562375168))
	- Finally, the elephant in the room: geopolitcs.
	  
	  My standout name there is Marko (@Geo_papic), and his CV really says it all.
	  
	  Effectively Marko introduced geopolitics into the institutional macro space, and he's been amongst the best at it since then.
