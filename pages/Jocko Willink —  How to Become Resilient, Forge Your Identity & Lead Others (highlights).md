	- The Impact of Cause and Effect on Our Relationship to the World
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Because we have a sense of self, it has something to do with our ability to have an impact on the world., * Our relationship to the world, and the things we do and how we receive feedback and give feedback, has a big impact.)

	  Because I think it really speaks to this thing that you mentioned, which is that when we first start to realize we have a sense of self, it has something to do with cause and effect on the world. Like we can have an impact in some way on things outside of us, outside of our home. Yeah, lately, I've been reading a lot of psychology, and I've been listening to some of your content. And I definitely want to talk to you about a study that you covered, relate to these. It's a brutal experiment with these kids that either had stutter or didn't have stutter. I want to get into that a little bit later. But what we do and how we treat people and how we receive feedback and give feedback has a big impact. But I think some of that happens just in our own relationship to things in the world. The old Hungarian psychologist, I'm learning how this idea of two kinds of people, they literally thought there were two kinds of people. There are generators and projectors. And generators are people that are just from a very young age, they realize they can impact other people positively negatively. And they want to create things in the world. They want to generate stuff and like, wow, I can actually like build stuff and break stuff and blow stuff up maybe, but also help things.

	- The Importance of Energy
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* The main focus for people should be on maintaining their energy levels., * Energy is an important aspect of life.)

	  Speaker 1
	  Are you keeping track of lifts and I'm sorry, I write down what I do. And I'll write down I write down what I do every day. And that way I can go back and say, you know, what was I doing back then? Because I might go through some phase where I'm trying to do more pullups or I'm trying to deadlift more and I'm trying or whatever the whatever the thing is, I'll go back in because I have a board of deadlifting after a while and let's face it, if you just want to be a good deadlifter, you're not going to be that fast, right? You're you're going to be slow on long runs. So you don't want to go too deep into deadlifting and you don't also don't want to be so good at long runs that you can't deadlift, you know, a good amount of weight. So I got to go through phases and I'll get into something for a while and I'll get into something else. So I do log down what I'm doing so I can look back and say, Oh, dang, you know, I'm not even close to as strong as I used to be need to get back to that.

	  I'm fascinated by the concept of energy. I think it's one of the most interesting aspects in all of biology, all of psychology and all of life. And what when I say energy, I mean, the distinction between being back on your heels flat footed at a forward center of mass, you know, and I get the impression and I think everyone gets the impression that you're somebody with a lot of energy. And I wonder whether or not you wake up with a lot of energy and you feel like you have to burn it off with this physical activity and work and other demands in your life. Where do you find that you wake up and your energy is kind of neutral and exercise and physical activity gives you energy? Because I think this is one of the key things out there. I think that acts as a barrier for people doing more with their body because they maybe they don't want to tire themselves out or maybe they don't feel like they have enough energy to begin with. It's also feeds into this idea that, you know, some people just have a lot of energy. ([Time 0:36:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1b28546b-e3a0-4092-bd76-e56c4764bc07))
	- The Importance of Waking Up Early and Getting Physical
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Waking up early and getting physical early in the day is an important way to increase the release of the hormone cortisol., * Cortisol is a non-negotiable peak and you want it to arrive early in the day., * Physical activity, caffeine, and intense exercise all amplify the cortisol peak.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  Yeah, I think it's a very important point because one of the things that we are learning from circadian biology, you know, time of day effects and sunlight and all that stuff that we talk about in our podcast that you've done intuitively, right? This is what we can arrive to. It was kind of crazy. Last time we had a conversation is that so many of the things that science is telling us to do and that we emphasize on the podcast, this podcast you've been doing or are built into military schedules. And one of them is this notion of waking up early and getting physical early in the day. And I suppose if we were to just throw one blanket rule on the table to encompass the broadest number of themes, it's that once every 24 hours, we each and all get a big increase in this release of the hormone cortisol, which everyone says, Oh, cortisol, it's terrible. You know, he's going to burn you out adrenal burnout, all that stuff. But it's a non-negotiable peak. And you want it to arrive early in the day and viewing sunlight, physical activity, caffeine, and in particular, intense exercise, all amplify that cortisol peak.

	- The Power of Intuitive Energy
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Discipline and energy are important aspects of the messaging and approach of the podcaster., * The catecholamines are important in providing energy for the body and brain.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  It's a fortunate fluke for all of us because so much of what you embody and what you do, I think centers around this idea of discipline, of course, but also energy. It's the intuitive sense I get about why people are so drawn to your messaging and what you do and how you do it. Energy, we know, of course, is caloric energy. I think that's what most people default to. They go, oh, that, how many calories are energy and how many calories in that unique calories to fuel things. But the energy that you're describing, I think is the one that, well, it really maps to Eastern traditions more directly, the whole yin and yang thing yin and yang. I always get that wrong. So which is the notion of neural energy. And so there's a particular cluster of chemicals in us as a fancy name called the catecholamines, but that's dopamine epinephrine, which is adrenaline and norepinephrine. And then you've got cortisol and those four hang out together and basically give us enough energy to run our brain and body for 50 days, 50 days. So the idea that you have to eat before you train, sure, for some people, that might work better than others. But I think what people don't realize is that anytime we're taking in caloric energy, it takes neural energy in order to digest that and put it into storage. And so the way you describe your day of, yeah, I also don't eat before I train, I like to hydrate and caffeinate. I have been drinking these before I train. I have to limit myself to two before because otherwise I'm already quaking a little bit at the second one, but I have a pretty high caffeine tolerance. So I like to train fast at all. And then I find it gives me energy. But then the moment that I eat a meal that's a little too large, all of a sudden I'm out of energy. And what's the deal? This calories are energy, right? You're supposed to have energy in order to think and move. And I think a lot of the world has this backwards. And this isn't a push for intermittent fasting or any particular style of eating.

	- How SEAL Teams Recover from Loss
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Athletes who are successful in college often have a difficult time adjusting to the stresses of SEAL training, and can quickly lose interest., * SEALs are generally resilient in the face of loss, and can help trainees learn how to cope.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  They all quit, not all of them quit, but there's plenty of examples of the highest level of collegiate athlete in sports that translate very well to what you're doing in basic SEAL training and they quit. And sometimes it's because they don't know how to lose, they don't know how to recover from a loss. And they're just so so I think already and once you get to a SEAL team, you've got people that are generally speaking going to be pretty resilient when it comes to dealing with a loss. Not only that, I mean, you just get used, you talk about losing people, your friends with this guy, you meet this guy in SEAL training, hey, this guy seems like a stud. Oh, he's just going to quit. And you're going to lose five, six, seven people, eight people, people quit so fast, you even keep track of them. So you're just going to lose, you're just going to get used to it. So there's that. Now, once you're in the teams and what you're talking about is now you start taking much more significant loss, you're not losing a race, you're losing one of your friends. And this is what from a leadership perspective, you have to pay attention to. So when you're in a leader in any organization, you're basically in charge of a mob. When it comes to what their morale is, they're, they're a mob and they feed off of each other, just like a mob riding in the streets going, Oh, we can break this window.
