	- The Impact of Cause and Effect on Our Relationship to the World
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Because we have a sense of self, it has something to do with our ability to have an impact on the world., * Our relationship to the world, and the things we do and how we receive feedback and give feedback, has a big impact.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  Because I think it really speaks to this thing that you mentioned, which is that when we first start to realize we have a sense of self, it has something to do with cause and effect on the world. Like we can have an impact in some way on things outside of us, outside of our home. Yeah, lately, I've been reading a lot of psychology, and I've been listening to some of your content. And I definitely want to talk to you about a study that you covered, relate to these. It's a brutal experiment with these kids that either had stutter or didn't have stutter. I want to get into that a little bit later. But what we do and how we treat people and how we receive feedback and give feedback has a big impact. But I think some of that happens just in our own relationship to things in the world. The old Hungarian psychologist, I'm learning how this idea of two kinds of people, they literally thought there were two kinds of people. There are generators and projectors. And generators are people that are just from a very young age, they realize they can impact other people positively negatively. And they want to create things in the world. They want to generate stuff and like, wow, I can actually like build stuff and break stuff and blow stuff up maybe, but also help things.

	- The Importance of Energy
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* The main focus for people should be on maintaining their energy levels., * Energy is an important aspect of life.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Are you keeping track of lifts and I'm sorry, I write down what I do. And I'll write down I write down what I do every day. And that way I can go back and say, you know, what was I doing back then? Because I might go through some phase where I'm trying to do more pullups or I'm trying to deadlift more and I'm trying or whatever the whatever the thing is, I'll go back in because I have a board of deadlifting after a while and let's face it, if you just want to be a good deadlifter, you're not going to be that fast, right? You're you're going to be slow on long runs. So you don't want to go too deep into deadlifting and you don't also don't want to be so good at long runs that you can't deadlift, you know, a good amount of weight. So I got to go through phases and I'll get into something for a while and I'll get into something else. So I do log down what I'm doing so I can look back and say, Oh, dang, you know, I'm not even close to as strong as I used to be need to get back to that.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I'm fascinated by the concept of energy. I think it's one of the most interesting aspects in all of biology, all of psychology and all of life. And what when I say energy, I mean, the distinction between being back on your heels flat footed at a forward center of mass, you know, and I get the impression and I think everyone gets the impression that you're somebody with a lot of energy. And I wonder whether or not you wake up with a lot of energy and you feel like you have to burn it off with this physical activity and work and other demands in your life. Where do you find that you wake up and your energy is kind of neutral and exercise and physical activity gives you energy? Because I think this is one of the key things out there. I think that acts as a barrier for people doing more with their body because they maybe they don't want to tire themselves out or maybe they don't feel like they have enough energy to begin with. It's also feeds into this idea that, you know, some people just have a lot of energy. ([Time 0:36:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1b28546b-e3a0-4092-bd76-e56c4764bc07))
	- The Importance of Waking Up Early and Getting Physical
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Waking up early and getting physical early in the day is an important way to increase the release of the hormone cortisol., * Cortisol is a non-negotiable peak and you want it to arrive early in the day., * Physical activity, caffeine, and intense exercise all amplify the cortisol peak.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  Yeah, I think it's a very important point because one of the things that we are learning from circadian biology, you know, time of day effects and sunlight and all that stuff that we talk about in our podcast that you've done intuitively, right? This is what we can arrive to. It was kind of crazy. Last time we had a conversation is that so many of the things that science is telling us to do and that we emphasize on the podcast, this podcast you've been doing or are built into military schedules. And one of them is this notion of waking up early and getting physical early in the day. And I suppose if we were to just throw one blanket rule on the table to encompass the broadest number of themes, it's that once every 24 hours, we each and all get a big increase in this release of the hormone cortisol, which everyone says, Oh, cortisol, it's terrible. You know, he's going to burn you out adrenal burnout, all that stuff. But it's a non-negotiable peak. And you want it to arrive early in the day and viewing sunlight, physical activity, caffeine, and in particular, intense exercise, all amplify that cortisol peak. ([Time 0:40:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5a850159-03ec-4fd0-a034-6f9c535e1dd3))
	- The Power of Intuitive Energy
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* [[Discipline]] and [[energy]] are important aspects of the messaging and approach of the podcaster., * The catecholamines are important in providing energy for the body and brain.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  It's a fortunate fluke for all of us because so much of what you embody and what you do, I think centers around this idea of discipline, of course, but also energy. It's the intuitive sense I get about why people are so drawn to your messaging and what you do and how you do it. Energy, we know, of course, is caloric energy. I think that's what most people default to. They go, oh, that, how many calories are energy and how many calories in that unique calories to fuel things. But the energy that you're describing, I think is the one that, well, it really maps to Eastern traditions more directly, the whole yin and yang thing yin and yang. I always get that wrong. So which is the notion of neural energy. And so there's a particular cluster of chemicals in us as a fancy name called the catecholamines, but that's dopamine [[epinephrine]], which is [[adrenaline]] and [[norepinephrine]]. And then you've got [[cortisol]] and those four hang out together and basically give us enough energy to run our brain and body for 50 days, 50 days. So the idea that you have to eat before you train, sure, for some people, that might work better than others. But I think what people don't realize is that anytime we're taking in caloric energy, it takes neural energy in order to digest that and put it into storage. And so the way you describe your day of, yeah, I also don't eat before I train, I like to hydrate and caffeinate. I have been drinking these before I train. I have to limit myself to two before because otherwise I'm already quaking a little bit at the second one, but I have a pretty high caffeine tolerance. So I like to train fast at all. And then I find it gives me energy. But then the moment that I eat a meal that's a little too large, all of a sudden I'm out of energy. And what's the deal? This calories are energy, right? You're supposed to have energy in order to think and move. And I think a lot of the world has this backwards. And this isn't a push for intermittent fasting or any particular style of eating.

	- How SEAL Teams Recover from Loss
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Athletes who are successful in college often have a difficult time adjusting to the stresses of SEAL training, and can quickly lose interest., * SEALs are generally resilient in the face of loss, and can help trainees learn how to cope.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  They all quit, not all of them quit, but there's plenty of examples of the highest level of collegiate athlete in sports that translate very well to what you're doing in basic SEAL training and they quit. And sometimes it's because they don't know how to lose, they don't know how to recover from a loss. And they're just so so I think already and once you get to a SEAL team, you've got people that are generally speaking going to be pretty resilient when it comes to dealing with a loss. Not only that, I mean, you just get used, you talk about losing people, your friends with this guy, you meet this guy in SEAL training, hey, this guy seems like a stud. Oh, he's just going to quit. And you're going to lose five, six, seven people, eight people, people quit so fast, you even keep track of them. So you're just going to lose, you're just going to get used to it. So there's that. Now, once you're in the teams and what you're talking about is now you start taking much more significant loss, you're not losing a race, you're losing one of your friends. And this is what from a leadership perspective, you have to pay attention to. So when you're in a leader in any organization, you're basically in charge of a mob. When it comes to what their morale is, they're, they're a mob and they feed off of each other, just like a mob riding in the streets going, Oh, we can break this window.

	- The Importance of Balance in Life
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Leaders should be able to modulate their emotions in order to help keep their followers in check., * It is important to have friends who can provide a balance for you in order to avoid succumbing to your own emotions.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  But all glory is fleeting, and I need to get back to work. And look, and do people go too far with that sometimes? Yes, absolutely. Sometimes people, they don't stop and celebrate at all. And those are the kind of people I think they get burned out eventually because they never say, hey, that was awesome. We had a big win. Cool. High five. They don't even say that. So I think, you know, as a leader, as a friend, as a parent, as a spouse, you want to be able to modulate that, help modulate that. Don't shut it down. You know, your kid walks off the wrestling mat with for a high five and you say, you could have won by more. No, I'm not talking about that. Or your kid walks off the mat after losing you say, you got what you deserve. No, you've got to be the counter, the counterweight to the emotions that other people have. And I think that when you're when you're doing a good job as a leader, as a friend, as a spouse or whatever, you're doing a good job as a counterweight. I think that's a good way to look at it. You want to you want to provide some balance for people to make sure that they don't get out of control. And you notice when people have a downfall, it's normally because they've surrounded themselves with people that there's no counter to. There's no counterbalance. You know, if you were my best friend and I, you know, I went out drinking last night and had a great time and party all night and met a girl and you're like, heck yeah, let's do it again tonight.

	- The Power of Music: A Neuroscientist's Perspective
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Music can be a powerful way to connect with people, and can be a source of recognition and kinship for both the speaker and the listener., * Music can be a powerful tool for personal development, as it can help to activate the dopamine system.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  I love what you just said. And when I say love, I really mean it because as we both know, we share a common love for certain music and particular minor threat and some stuff from the punk rock scene. In particular for me, the Northeast punk rock scene, the bruisers, Al Bar from the bruisers. And now people know him as the lead singer for the dropkick Murphy's before that was the bruise. And when we we run the risk of going deep down a rabbit hole of music that most people may or may not be familiar with, although most people will hear the drop kicks. But yeah, I'm right there with you. I mean, I remember the first time hearing stiff little fingers or rancid and even bouncing soles for New Jersey, not even bouncing soles. Sorry, sorry, sorry, Brian and Greg, like, no, the bouncing soles and going, yes, that, that's me. That's it. Like, but as you said, it was already kind of in you. It's like a recognition. And I bring this up and I want to highlight it not because we share this. Although I do find that to be an amazing kinship that we felt right away and was like, we'd probably riff for 25 hours just on that. But it brings me back to this idea that certainly is not my idea. Actually, the first time I heard about it was from [[Robert Green]], who wrote the book [[Mastery]] and some important writings, you know, various, what was it? I think it was the forget how many laws of power, but those books, Robert Green, Mastery is actually a book that I highly recommend people read because it talks about mentorship and finding mentors and the fact that we're supposed to break up and move on from [[mentors]] and that mentors aren't always people that we know or that know us, etc. Amazing book, really. But he was the first person I ever heard, described this idea that if we think back long enough, there's some seed moment, it was shopping for the pants. It sounds like it was, but also music where you see something and it's like, yes, that's me and I'm that. And then that becomes a sort of soundtrack or visual image or something for your life that you carry forward with you. The neuroscientist in me wants to say that that is the first time that we really tap into this dopamine system in a way that is unique ([Time 1:42:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/01de19eb-4904-499e-804f-526fbf7b53e2))
	- The Loss of Perception About Time
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* There is something about the lack of ability to see into the future that can lead to depression and suicide., * There is also something about the loss of a sense of identity and the feeling of being useless that can contribute to suicide.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  Again, I'm also hesitant to like talk about this because no one wants to spark this, but there does seem to be something about lack of ability to see into a future, obviously, or the future that people are seeing into is so dark that somehow they lose touch with the idea that emotions come and go. You said it about emotion, about motivation, emotions come and go, but somehow people lose touch with that. And then I, I will venture a guess and here I'm hoping someone's going to figure this out at some point. So we can have a more concrete conversation about the mechanisms and what to do about it, but I think there's also something about identity, about loss of a place to put one's energy, something useful in the world. If you're a, what you were talking about here are guys that are generators, right? They are not projectors. They're generators. They live to have effective action on the world for good and then end up killing themselves in youth. It's a little more complicated to put a finger on, you know, because what's going on there? We assume depression, but then in learning more about suicide, there's also this kind of like excitement of for certain people about solving something that seemed unsolvable any other way. And again, I'm not certainly not encouraging this. I strongly discouraging people from taking their own life, obviously, but there's something about time and the loss of perception about time.

	- Third-Personing the Self: A Conversation with Rachelle
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Third person, active style can help you be more observant and engage in things without thinking too much., * Meditation can help you be more observant and engage in things without thinking too much.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  I love that. And I love it because it really speaks to the power of thinking carefully and being patient and a little bit slower at times. I also heard you say something earlier that's still flagging in my mind, which is not thinking too much. I think it seems to be a time where thinking too much is very dangerous. And again, we can keep the discussion that we were having about mental health, or we could even just call it what is, mental illness. I think everyone would agree suicide is some reflection of an unhealthy state. We can keep that in the backdrop as we talk about this, but this isn't necessarily only about that. You seem to have an ability to engage in things without thinking too much, and yet also to sit back and be pretty observant. And you've talked about third-personing of the self. I'd love to talk a little bit more about this, even though it's a topic you've delved into before. And in particular, the topic of meditation, I've been reading more about meditation. I've meditated for different stretches in my life, different amounts of time. ([Time 2:14:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/744d5ab2-52dd-4d6a-97b5-404478f69bbe))
	- The Power of [[Love]]
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Love is a powerful tool that can help us tap into a variety of abilities and qualities that we wouldn't be able to achieve on our own., * It's important to remember that not everyone has children, and the importance of taking care of our young is still relevant regardless.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  Like we, as your case was with music, particular music, and communities, or the example of shopping for the pants and that experience of like the first time you tap into something that really feels kind of unique to you. Like there's something here to be able to find work that includes that, but also is hard and also allows you to evolve over time. I mean, I think that's, that's the real, that's the real gift that I think most people are seeking. And of course, there's no shortcut to that, except perhaps one, which is to be able to sense the difference between [[ambition]] and there's no better word for it. Let's just call it what it is, which is [[love]]. Like, I love this. And the reason I think that love is so powerful, and here I'm sounding like Lex Friedman, but I don't mean inter-relational love. I mean, like sort of that being able to sense what that feels like is that I do believe that it allows us to tap into an enormous number of things that [[fear]] alone and [[ambition]] alone and just being a hard driving person alone will not allow us to tap into things like [[adaptiveness]], [[creativity]]. And there's, and I think there's a really obvious reason for it, which is that the one thing we know about our species is that we want to make more of ourselves and to take good care of our young. Whether or not everyone has kids or not is irrelevant. The point is that every species not only wants to do that, but need to do that.

	- The Importance of Building a Positive Relationship with Your Team
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Relationships are important in order to have successful teamwork., * It is not just about working well together, but also having a positive relationship.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, if you have a team of 10 people and you all have a great relationship and you get along well and you're going against my team and we all hate each other and we're, who's gonna win?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  The team that loves each other is gonna win. I would hope. It's not even close.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  It's not even matter of fact, if you work for me and you don't like me, what kind of performance are you gonna give me? It's gonna be tough. What if you love me and I've looked out for you and I've done everything for you and I've taken care of you? What kind of performance are you gonna get me? Everything you got? Yeah, I'll die for you. So, yeah, and you know, earlier you asked about the human animal and human nature and this is part of leadership. I got asked this question the other day by a, I was working with a company and the ([Time 2:35:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6974d983-9170-4539-aa20-6de5b620e51e))

	- The Power of Detachment
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Being able to take a step back and detach from the mob mentality is a key skill for success., * It can be hard to do, but it is essential for achieving success.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  What could I do where I could use my skill set? And obviously he had some entrepreneurial spirit and was able to figure that out. So being able to be a part of a team, and it goes to what I was saying earlier about the mob, being able to be part of a team, part of the mob, part of the gang, but still have the ability to take a step back, detach from that and assess what is the best way for this team to move forward. I mean, you could have this brilliant idea that from now on, you're going to make all of your podcasts about the molecular structure of whatever. And the rest of the team probably need to pull you aside and say, hey, man, I know you really care about that. And that's awesome. But everyone really wants to hear about this other stuff. So let's tie it in together. Let's expand what you this specific thing you want to talk about. So being able to take a step back, detach and see the bigger picture to me is the true superpower of life of life. And it's a lot harder than it sounds. And you know, this goes back to when you start talking about people that are having going through struggles in life, right? And I've described this before as, you know, if I'm looking at you and you're you're in a bad state, right? You're depressed, you're sad, you're moping around, you're not getting anything done.

	- The Importance of Knowing When Something is Important
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Problem solving is a skill that can be useful in many areas of life., * Knowing when something is important can help to avoid wasting time and energy on things that are not worth solving., * Taking a step back and assessing the importance of a problem can help to determine how much effort and resources should be spent on it.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  And I think without going into this in any more detail, and of course, you can send me a bill at the end, by the way, I think this is some- Confessions are free, man. Yeah. So I think that being a problem solver is great. Being forward center mass is great. I think learning the systems of the brain and body and understanding psychology and learning about oneself, the Oracle, how to write, know thyself in ways that you can maneuver functionally in your life and career and relationship, etc. Great. But I think there's also a downside to being overly fixated. It was like my Bulldog Costello used to be chewing on something, chewing on something. Next thing I know, he's chewing on his foot. And you're like, hey, you'd have to rip him off his own foot and he'd be like, because that chew reflex was just so strong that sometimes it would turn on himself. That's kind of how it feels. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I wrote a book called Leadership Strategy and Tactics. And one of the things that I wrote about in that book is understanding what's important and what's not. And this is very similar to what you're talking about. Looking at a problem and taking a step back and going, well, A, is this important or not? And B, is this solver bore? Is it not? And C, what's the ROI on getting it solved? And what's the effort it's going to take to get this problem solved? And how much is it really going to impact my world and my life if I focus on it? So knowing and understanding when something's important or not is a very good skill. ([Time 2:53:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d856387f-fbd9-4d22-b203-b4a5b8ca92f3))
	- How to De-escalate a Situation
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* When returning from a mission, it is important to take a breath and detach from the emotions that were experienced., * To do this, it is important to broaden one's field of view and detach from the situation.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  So, you know, when you get back from the mission, everything goes away. You sounded like a baby out there. So, what would I do before I would key up my radio? Take a breath. And so here, I'm manually slowing down my breath. I'm broadening my field of view. So, if you're in a meeting or you're at the supermarket parking lot and someone starts to yell at you, take a step back, take a breath, broaden your field of view, detach from those emotions that you're having, and make some space. And that's how I go through the mechanics of detachment. Now, I can tell you right now, I mean, when you do this all the time, which I kind of do this all the time, I don't really have to like step back. But when you're starting to be able to try and do this, absolutely make them a ca- And I'll tell you, here's another like weird little nuance thing. Lift your chin up and put your hands down. Now, this isn't not in the combat situation, not in a fight, but here's the thing. When I get defensive, what am I going to do? I'm going to raise my hands up and put my chin down. That's like a fighting mode. So, if you and I are having a discussion and I'm starting to get heated and I'm starting to like, oh, he's not listening to me, instead of me putting my chin down and putting my hands up to where I can put them in your face a little bit, no, I'm actually going to take a step back and I'm going to say, put my chin up.
