	- a huge grey area exists between actionable, completable tasks and purely encyclopedic notes
	- Eventually, I discovered a better mental model for my working style: I ask myself how immediately I need to take action on something.
	- One is for notes that are changing often. Day-to-day tasks, things to remember for the next week, even long notes and links related to what I’m working on now. The other app is for notes that grow over time, like notes I take while reading books or watching talks, my annual goals, financial planning, reading list, and project outlines. My two notes apps mirror the way my brain works best – one is my short-term, working memory, the other is my long-term memory.
	- Search for tools that view the world and your work the way your mind does, and prefer tools that can grow with you over time, the way that works best for you.
