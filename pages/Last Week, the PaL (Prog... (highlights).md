- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 30th, 2022]]
	- Last week, the PaL (Program-aided Language models) paper came out, pushing the boundary of LLM performance on math/symbolic reasoning tasks
	  
	  As of today, it's in 🦜🔗LangChain
	  
	  🙂Was super fun to work with @urialon1 & @aman_madaan on this

	- See the below for a far better explanation of PaL than I could ever give
	  
	  If I had to give one: use an LLM to figure out what to do, but a Python interpreter to actually do it

	- When this paper came I think at least five people told me I had to include it in LangChain
	  
	  I reached out to @urialon1 and he was excited by the possibility
	  
	  He put me in contact with @aman_madaan who fielded a lot of my silly questions and helped get it in 🙂 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hwchase17/status/1597625121568456704))
	- The original paper implements 5 different prompts for PaL, only two are implemented in LangChain (math and colored objects)
	  
	  For the remaining ones, check out the original code/repo: https://t.co/mSUotizA0k
	  
	  And read the full paper here: https://t.co/Jhz9NljOjP ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hwchase17/status/1597625122977824768))
	- Overall, this paper is a fantastic example in utilizing LLMs + other computation sources to achieve better results than an LLM could alone
	  
	  👏👏👏 to the authors @luyu_gao @aman_madaan @shuyanzhxyc, with @stefan_fee Yiming Yang, @JamieCallan @gneubig and @urialon1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hwchase17/status/1597625124605161472))
