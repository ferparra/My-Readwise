	- A small thread on why JS devs might find Go interesting (this thread is not for Go devs, it is intentionally 101) üßµ
	  
	  1. Short variable declaration:

	- 2. The time package is really nice. For instance, you can import ‚Äútime‚Äù and then use it like so:

	- 3. You can import and alias packages very quickly. for instance, to import that package of time, you could say 
	  
	  import ‚Äútime‚Äù
	  
	  or to import multiple package and/or alias them:

	- 4. range. A very declarative for loop, range will take the range of what‚Äôs provided and iterate. It doesn‚Äôt have to be integers either, as long as you have more than two indexes, you‚Äôre good.
	  
	  Example:

	- 5. Go has its own built-in documentation system. Once go is installed (you can install it here https://t.co/aMb3Rw3qfN) you can run ‚Äúgo doc‚Äù and then any keyword in the terminal, and it will return a ton of information! Think like MDN docs in the terminal.
	  
	  Try it:
	  go doc fmt

	- 6a. type declarations, even in functions, are straightforward!

	- 6b. But we can declare a few at a time if they‚Äôre the same type, like: x, y int
	  
	  Here we‚Äôre specifying the type of the parameter as well as the type of the return after the parenths:
