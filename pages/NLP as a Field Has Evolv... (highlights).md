	- 1. BERT
	  
	  BERT is a neural network-based language mode from Google that is trained to perform natural language processing tasks. It was introduced by google researchers in 2018.

	- 2. BART
	  
	  BART is a sequence-to-sequence model that uses a denoising autoencoder to pre-train its encoder and decoder. The model was designed to be able to handle long sequences by using a Transformer architecture. It was released in 2019.

	- 3. T5
	  
	  T5 is designed to be used for a variety of tasks, including text classification, question answering, and text generation. T5 is also trained on a larger amount of data than BERT, which makes it more accurate for some tasks.

	- 4. GPT-3
	  
	  Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 is a 175 billion parameter model that can write text similar to humans in response to an input prompt. The model is based on the transformer architecture and got released in 2020.

	- 5. LaMDA
	  
	  Language Models for Dialog Application (LaMDA) was to enable software to better engage in a fluid and natural conversation. Unlike other language models, LaMDA was trained on dialogue and was introduced by google in 2021.

	- 6. Switch Transformers 
	  
	  Switch Transformers is the first trillion parameters model open-sourced by Google in 2022. It is based on the concept of MoE where models can choose different parameters for different inputs based to achieve higher performance.
