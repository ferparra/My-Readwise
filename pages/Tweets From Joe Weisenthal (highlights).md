	- Treasuries are great for media narratives:
	  
	  Yields going down: Uh-oh, markets pricing in slow growth, deflation, and failure of the Fed to normalize.
	  
	  Yields going up: Uh-oh, markets are pricing in inflation, fears about the deficit, and the Fed losing control of the long end. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1361675390171938817))
	- We like to joke about setting up illegal DeFI onion futures...
	  
	  But for real, right now, we need new futures contracts in all kinds of stuff: 
	  
	  Average Hourly Earnings futures
	  Used car futures
	  Freight futures
	  Vessel futures
	  New Home Sales (volume) futures
	  
	  Spin 'em up DeFi crew! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1415079546802606080))
