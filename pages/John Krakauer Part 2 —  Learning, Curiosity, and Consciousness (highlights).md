	- What Makes Us Human?
	  
	  Summary:
	  The once vast island of human exceptionalism has lost significant ground to wave upon wave of research. But there remains a clear sense that humans stand apart, evidenced by our unique capacity to overrun the planet and remake it in our image. How are our gifts of simulation and imagination different from those of other animals? What can we know of the curiosity of even larger systems in which we're embedded?

	  That may be true, but at the moment, I don't see it in a form where you can go, ah yes.

	  What makes us human? Over the last several decades, the once vast island of human exceptionalism has lost significant ground to wave upon wave of research revealing cognition, emotion, problem solving, and tool use in other organisms. But there remains a clear sense that humans stand apart, evidenced by our unique capacity to overrun the planet and remake it in our image. What is unique about the human mind, and how might we engage this question rigorously through the lens of neuroscience? How are our gifts of simulation and imagination different from those of other animals, and what, if anything, can we know of the curiosity of even larger systems in which we're embedded, the social superorganisms, ecosystems, technospheres within which we exist like neurons in the brain?

	- Prediction and Anticipation Are Not the Same Thing
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  One thing that I do want to unpack for people, though, is the team here gives a list of the four dizidarata. Right. Now continual learning constraints, curiosity, and causal estimation. And then identifies these as features that distinguish prospective learning, future oriented learning, from retrospective learning, and then gives all these lovely examples of how far back you can witness behavioral evidence of anticipation all throughout the animal kingdom. And you can start to beg the question of whether this was convergent or whether it's just deep, deep, ancient truth. And which I thought was a strange question, really, because the intuition at SFI would be arguably even non-animals are doing this. There are ways that you can see like, you know, micro-risal affiliations doing something that looks like this, just because we now have dug ourselves deep enough into talking about this paper that we probably owe people. Sure, sure. To map this out for them.

	  I think anticipation and prediction are not the same thing. There are many impressive anticipatory circuits that you and I use every day that are a mixture of having been hardwired and learned. Prediction is a stronger notion than anticipation. And in a way implies simulation. And this gets to the idea of learned models of the world that you can then simulate on to predict your next step or what you're going to do. And then that leads to the notion of planning into the future. In neuroscience, there's huge interest in model-based learning.
