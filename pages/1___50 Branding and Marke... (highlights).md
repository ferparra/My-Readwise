	  Branding and marketing for crypto startups: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090837372784644))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 2/50
	  
	  I was inspired by @SBF_Alameda's earlier tweet talking a bit about branding.
	  
	  Having spent the bulk of my career focused on branding and marketing, both for startups and Fortune 500s, I've spent a lot of time thinking about what matters, and for which type of company. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090838379413508))
	- 3/50
	  
	  People often conflate marketing, user acquisition and branding.
	  
	  They are distinct things, and believe it or not they are sciences. They aren't things simply left to an intern with a Twitter account, or a guy writing blog posts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090839386136577))
	- 4/50
	  
	  Unlike dev work, where the execution of the code tells you that you're wrong, many people claim themselves marketing gurus simply by being able to write English.
	  
	  And, I assure you, they are lining up to sell you every service under the sun. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090840585707525))
	- 5/50
	  
	  So what is branding?
	  
	  It isn't just your 'brand' in the sense of a name and logo, although these are important, they are just the identifying triggers of the brand.
	  
	  A brand in its entirety is actually the logical and emotional responses those triggers invoke in a customer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090842032660480))
	- 6/50
	  
	  If we played a word association game, it would start to paint a picture:
	  
	  "Volvo" - "Safety"
	  "BMW" - "Luxury Sport"
	  "Mercedes" - "Well Engineered"
	  
	  These are the elements that the brand has worked incredibly hard to own in a place we call the consumers "mindspace" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090843068747778))
	- 7/50
	  
	  It's a lucrative but costly and complex network of real estate that drastically impacts how consumers relate to your brand.
	  
	  It used to be that the consumer mindspace was segmented, private and lived within the person and their demographic alone. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090844045971468))
	- 8/50
	  
	  In an advertising time period called "The TV Industrial Complex" (America-90s) we were so receptive and yet still so isolated to messages, that it was effective to bombard us with them until we believed almost any message, and so brand and advertising became quite conflated ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090845073530888))
	- 9/50
	  
	  But, the internet, especially social media, drastically changed the way in which we interact, both with brands and with other demographics and it shifted the 'mindspace' from being solely in the customer, to being partly interwoven in a public narrative. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090846113718275))
	- 10/50
	  
	  While you could still target different demographics with different messages, they all became interwoven and shared in a public domain, and much to the heartache of many brands, these messages became much more delicate as they stopped being a monologue and became a dialogue ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090847736913920))
	- 11/50
	  
	  A brand is what your company is. 
	  
	  Not rationally on paper, but at its essence in how people feel about it.
	  
	  A company sells a product "I use an IBM PC" a brand is an emotional identity "I *am* an Apple user" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090848684822531))
	- 12/50
	  
	  But, a brand cannot be all things.
	  
	  In fact the first immutable law of branding (Ries) states that the strength of a brand is inversely proportional to its scope.
	  
	  That is, the more things you try to be, the less effective you are at it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090849653764097))
	- 13/50
	  
	  Why?
	  
	  Because the human mind is really crap. We're not good at building multiple associations and often make problematic fallacies of composition.
	  
	  This becomes a problem in recall/consideration phase of a buyer journey 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4qAtUyX0AECwjX.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090853290225666))
	- 13/50
	  
	  Consider this.
	  
	  We all know that local dinner or corner deli that sells everything.
	  
	  It's got coffee, submarine sandwiches, soups, baked goods, chips, and the daily newspaper and all likely at a reasonable price. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090854607233027))
	- 14/50
	  
	  But, when you walk out the door and think "I want a sub" you probably think of "Subway" and not "Bob's Deli and Sandwich Shop"
	  
	  Despite having all the same options and more, we don't think of Bob's.
	  
	  Because in 1965, Fred Deluca decided to only focus on subs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090855626452996))
	- 15/50
	  
	  Now, not only does that focus create a stronger brand association in our mind, but, Porter would also tell you its a fantastic business strategy, as really the amount of effort it takes to be 'great' at anything is 100x the focus it takes to be good at many things. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090856612151296))
	- 16/50
	  
	  When we think of the relationship between companies and customers, the goal of a brand is as follows:
	  
	  1. Own a specific mindspace, so when a customer is ready to make a buying decision on X, they think of us. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090857752965127))
	- 17/50
	  
	  2. Build an emotional identity and clout bank with a customer. (The clout cashes in when they forgive our friction points, or advocate for us as a brand, we need to make that easy for them) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090858776371211))
	- 18/50
	  
	  The goal of a brand mark is:
	  
	  1. Be simple, identifiable, and memorable, so that we lower the effort of recall.
	  
	  2. Be a simple and unique visual that can exist well in both positive and negative space, so we can be quickly recognized in the limited attention time we have. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090859862642692))
	- 19/50
	  
	  That's it.
	  
	  Your brand doesn't really do much else.
	  
	  The rest comes down to marketing.
	  
	  Marketing is different for each stage of company and their goal. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090860902825991))
	- 20/50
	  
	  1. Marketing the brand: You promote your brand, not with the goal of converting users. Instead, your goal is to make sure everyone is aware of your brands message and triggers for future campaigns, or so they include you in their next natural consideration phase. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090861871812615))
	- 21/50
	  
	  2. Marketing the category: If you are the de facto leader in the space, promoting your brand overly spends clout, so instead educate on the space and grow the 'blue ocean' (Mauborgne), and you'll win out the users anyway ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090862878343169))
	- 22/50
	  
	  3. CTA Marketing: Directly advertising to try and convert users on a specific call to action. Is improved by clout previously built by brand, but is costly and needs targeting. Is the most efficient way to bootstrap early. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090863864004614))
	- 23/50
	  
	  4. Development Marketing: Developing users through the customer funnel and their internal relationship once they are already a customer to develop them into advocates, or retain them with banked clout. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090865059479553))
	- 24/50
	  
	  5. Narrative Marketing: Trying to shape a categories public narrative outside of your brand for your benefit.
	  
	  5. Culture marketing: Promotion of your internal culture, usually to benefit hiring or fundraising. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408090866070269960))
	- 25/50
	  
	  Most other activities from PR, sponsorships or even community building fall under the specific execution of some of these macro strategies.
	  
	  But the challenge is, not only are these all more complicated than just buying ads ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091459992031235))
	- 26/50
	  
	  But, most companies also focus on the wrong types of marketing at the wrong part of their lifecycle.
	  
	  Most startups are focused on trying to get users in the door on early CTAs, but do it by trying to put their brand everywhere. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091461246242817))
	- 27/50
	  
	  As I mentioned before all types of branding and marketing are a science. Despite popular belief, they are highly measurable.
	  
	  If you are a well funded startup, with a clear user LTV, and know your conversion and churn metrics then maybe that's the right fit for you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091462437421057))
	- 28/50
	  
	  But the type of creative, and targeting for that message is distinctly different from the type of brand promotion that late stage companies do in order to keep their brands top of mind once they already own that real estate. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091463678939140))
	- 29/50
	  
	  You won't grow a business by running the same type of playbooks that Apple or JP Morgan currently run, because they are at an entirely different stage of business than you are. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091464853250048))
	- 30/50
	  
	  Looking back through their history won't help you either, because we're in a period of large playbook shifts these days and consumers are more resilient to most types of marketing than ever before. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091466036043780))
	- 31/50
	  
	  But, there are three things that most defi/crypto businesses are at the right stage for, that do work, and where I think most should be spending their focus these days. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091467231420422))
	- 32/50
	  
	  The first is authentic engagement.
	  
	  This is something that @SBF_Alameda did well for @FTX_Official as it got its start. Being on Twitter all the time, engaging with customers, and going the extra mile for them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091468695224324))
	- 33/50
	  
	  That genuine approach built confidence in a sector where most brands are faceless corporate entities.
	  
	  And, I'd bet has driven many times the users/volume to FTX compared to their sponsorships, which would aim to simply be brand visibility (I hope for B2B targets) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091469899046918))
	- 34/50
	  
	  When I was working for a crypto exchange back in 2014, we took the same approach. Where most exchanges were unseen entities, we were one with an office, team pictures & constantly on social media. I spent my days replying to everyone I could on Reddit that built connection ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091471081791496))
	- 35/50
	  
	  The second is one that I think @SushiSwap does amazingly well and that is cultural marketing.
	  
	  In our industry currently, there are not a ton of users, its hard to hop the chasm and there is plenty of dry powder capital to fund you, so you aren't desperate for revenue - ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091472256278529))
	- 36/50
	  
	  But, what is scarce, is talent.
	  
	  Even crazy high wages can't convince the top talent to come work for you, and so you need to create and foster a team culture and external perspective of the team that is exciting and engaging to attract top talent. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091474189852672))
	- 37/50
	  
	  And, that talent is *critical* because of the third marketing approach, which is actually the user UX.
	  
	  Not just in terms of design, but the entire spectrum of user touchpoints from design, customer support, user education etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091475359961093))
	- 38/50
	  
	  Defi products are complicated, ugly, technical, and all over all...bad...
	  
	  It's part of what happens in heavy engineering industries, especially when startups struggle to shift from fast moving MVP products to corporate product approaches. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091476555411466))
	- 39/50
	  
	  You cannot effectively make a jump to advertising to, and attracting mainstream cross-chasm users, until you have a product that is simple, beautiful and easy to use for that every day user.
	  
	  It is simply table stakes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091477759123460))
	- 40/50
	  
	  And quite honestly, we don't have that yet in this industry.
	  
	  At least, I've yet to find it.
	  
	  Coinbase (on both web and mobile) come closest, but, still aren't perfect. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091478912602119))
	- 41/50
	  
	  In defi and exchanges, even things we think are well designed would fail even the most simple UX testing environments.
	  
	  Because we have so many baked in assumptions from having been in this space. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091480078565386))
	- 42/50
	  
	  And the reality is that most finance products which we base ourselves on are pretty bad too (go ahead, ask how many people like their banking app) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091481244639250))
	- 43/50
	  
	  But, I know a well talent engineer who has had exposure to this space, who struggled to find out how to withdraw USD on @FTX_Official, or how to do their first swap on @Uniswap 
	  
	  And, I know plenty of people that didn't know @blockfolio even had an investment section ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091482372837382))
	- 44/50
	  
	  It may seem strange to talk about UX so heavily when we were on about branding.
	  
	  But that's part of the point.
	  
	  Marketing is how you convey a message to a user.
	  
	  Both explicitly, and implicitly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091483551457285))
	- 45/50
	  
	  Every touch point you have *IS* marketing as it shapes how a customer feels about you.
	  
	  These all impact the mindspace the customer has about you.
	  
	  Do they see you as secure, professional, safe and reliable? They might not if your layout feels unconsidered. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091484772093957))
	- 46/50
	  
	  While centralized crypto products are starting to reach the stage of brand visibility marketing, or spending on CTA conversions, most defi projects will burn through their cash in a wasteful fashion with "CMOs" who don't know what they're doing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091486009401344))
	- 47/50
	  
	  Instead:
	  
	  1. Decide what one thing you want your brand to represent.
	  
	  2. Focus on authentically connecting with your earliest users in ways that don't scale, and embody your brand in these interactions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091487301160970))
	- 48/50
	  
	  3. Work on defining and promoting an engaging culture (product vision, team interaction, community environment) to attract top talent.
	  
	  4. Focus on every overlooked touchpoint of your product to see if it represents you the way you deserve to be seen. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091488588898310))
	- 49/50
	  
	  If you do all those things, instead of listening to a lot of half-baked ad agencies, you'll go a lot farther on a lot less capital. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091489834577920))
	- 50/50
	  
	  (Bonus points: If you do have to do something promotional, do something unconventional. Publicity stunts, atypical ads, being the first at something. Be noteworthy and contrarian because earned media beats out paid ads, and its way more fun!) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1408091558872768522))
