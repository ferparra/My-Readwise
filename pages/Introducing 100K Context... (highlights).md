	- Introducing 100K Context Windows! We’ve expanded Claude’s context window to 100,000 tokens of text, corresponding to around 75K words. Submit hundreds of pages of materials for Claude to digest and analyze. Conversations with Claude can go on for hours or days. https://t.co/4WLEp7ou7U ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1656700154190389248))

	- We fed Claude-Instant The Great Gatsby (72K tokens), except we modified one line to say that Mr. Carraway was "a software engineer that works on machine learning tooling at Anthropic." We asked the model to spot what was added - it responded with the right answer in 22 seconds. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1656700156518060033))
