		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ Kaczynski lists the 4 big problems with modern civilization:
	- 2/ The big difference between the primitive civilization and our contemporary world is that before, individuals had a lot of autonomy while the state was largely powerless to penetrate into the everyday life of people
	  
	  Kaczynski argues that modern tech suddenly flips this balance ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1577392463714844672))
	- 3/ The balance of power between individuals and the larger “system” flipped when machines made much of human labor obsolete while simultaneously allowing big corp and big govt to observe, track, exclude (social media bans, stripping away bank accounts) anyone being naughty ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1577392585320325120))
	- 4/ Ted Kaczynski writes:
	  
	  “The Industrial Revolution has radically altered man’s environment..it is to be expected that as technology is increasingly applied to the human body and mind, man himself will be altered as radically as his environment and way of life have been.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1577392658540298241))
	- 5/ With robots doing most work will people find work in “service industries”?
	  
	  Kaczynski says no
	  
	  People will reject the “pointless busywork” of  “driving each other around, making handicrafts, waiting on tables” and embrace dangerous outlets: “drugs, crime, cults, hate groups”

	- 6/ Kaczynski  against Leftism:
	  
	  “Leftism is in the long run inconsistent with wild nature, with human freedom and with the elimination of modern technology. Leftism is collectivist; it seeks to bind together the entire world (both nature and the human race) into a unified whole.”

	- 7/ Kaczynski devotes a large chunk of his manifesto attacking leftism
	  
	  But in a powerful paragraph, he argues that the conservatives are fools too

	- 8/ The system knowingly destroys intimate bonds between people because it wants to SOAK UP all the loyalty and energy of individuals for itself
	  
	  Kaczynski writes: “The technological society HAS TO weaken family ties and local communities if it is to function efficiently.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1577394733839970304))
	- 9/ A “democracy” with advanced tech is less free than a “dictatorship” with primitive technology
	  
	  A low tech society has “no rapid long-distance communications, no surveillance cameras, no dossiers of information about the lives of average citizens”
	  
	  Easier to “evade control" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1577394963721355265))
	- 10/ Can we go back to small-scale communities? 
	  
	  Kaczynski says no because we are  “enmeshed with and dependent on large-scale systems like public utilities, computer networks, highway systems, the mass communications media and the modern health-care system.”

	- 11/ How to rebel 
	  
	  Step 1: CHAOS
	  
	  Kaczynski:
	  
	  “We must work to heighten the social stresses within the system so as to increase the likelihood that it will...be weakened sufficiently so that a revolution against it becomes possible.”
	  
	  First weaken the system you want to destroy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1577395692708167681))
	- 12/ Step 2: Let the propaganda begin
	  
	  Kaczynski: “Develop and propagate an ideology that opposes technology and the industrial system”
	  
	  This will ensure that “when industrial society breaks down,” it stays broken
	  
	  Factories must be destroyed and “technical books” must be burnt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1577395844621692928))
	- 13/ Step 3: RETVRN TO NATURE
	  
	  Nature is Kaczynski’s “counter-ideal to technology” because it is self-contained, “beautiful,” and already has “tremendous popular appeal”
	  
	  The technological civilization must expand wastefully to survive, is ugly, and is largely despised ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1577395970341752832))
	- 14/ Kaczynski on the importance of aims:
	  
	  “Secure aristocracies that have no need to exert themselves usually become bored, hedonistic & demoralized, even though they have power. This shows that power is not enough. One must have goals toward which to exercise one’s power.”
