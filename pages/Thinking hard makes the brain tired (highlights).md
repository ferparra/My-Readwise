	- I learned this week that "occupational burnout" [1] *often* results in the brain developing a trauma response to the idea of returning to the same job/tasks, which is why people will sometimes entirely switch careers. It absolutely is the brain trying to protect itself.
	  
	  Not all forms of burnout results in trauma responses, but they all require extended recovery. Burnout is preventable, but once it has been reached, the damage has been done and rest is required. No joke: 3-6 months is the usual recovery time.
	  
	  Paths to occupational burnout: - No mental rest from work. "Taking it home with you." Often skipping breaks to keep focused. - Jobs that require high amounts of mental processing for long periods (customer service, development, troubleshooting, multitasking, urgent-response).
	  
	  "Brown out" is the stage when you're still capable of functioning in spurts, but your brain/body is sending warning signs (that we have been taught to ignore).

	- There are three ways to flush acute glutamate buildup from the brain:
	  
	  1. Exercise. The brain can direct glutamate to be used as an energy source to dispose of excess amounts. Glutamate naturally flows by diffusion from areas of high concentration (in blood vessel wall cells) through the blood vessel wall into the circulating bloodstream, where the concentration is lower.
	  
	  2. Eat a tuna sandwich or drink an energy drink. Vitamin B6 is a a coenzyme in the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA from glutamate. Thinking jobs is also coincident with rising popularity of energy drinks from 2000s onwards. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx2wx8nx8bm3v4wb6mbzt3fs))
	- I tell my wife, "My brain hurts, I'm going for a walk." There does appear to be only so much paper shuffling my mind can do when working on programming problems before it requires the drawers be emptied or whatever it is the walk induces.

	  I've a hypothesis that a lot of the actual work is done in the background.
	  
	  Focused thinking about a problem just sort of spawns new threads (some of which get OOM-killed if you keep spawning more). The process seems to need not actively thinking about the problem for the jobs to actually resolve.
	  
	  It's like thinking about the problem triggers the background calculations to start, it doesn't actually perform the work.
	  
	  Then you get that famous "aha!" in the shower or when you're off on a walk or whatever. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx2wxprfcysfv37m7c13w437))
	- There's a really great book called Consciousness and the Brain that goes into all the various research around how our brain works, and there is a huge amount that we think of as "thinking" that is totally unconscious to us. As I've aged, it seems like more and more of my thought processes are unknown to me. I just get agitated thinking about things, go do something for a while, then my unconscious "me" is suddenly like, "ok, here's the understanding".

	- This is similar to Rich Hickey’s talk on “Hammock Driven Development”:

	  Spend your conscious time loading your brain with data. Spend your unconscious time randomly making connections… until “Eureka!” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx2wym0d8h3rmm003defmgx6))
