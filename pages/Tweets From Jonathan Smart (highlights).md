	- Pattern: three key roles at every level in the nested value streams, as equals: 
	  (1) Value Outcome Lead (What, value)
	  (2) Team Outcome Lead (How, system of work)
	  (3) Architecture Outcome Lead (How, business, data & tech)
	  
	  Equals, not a Feature Factory, keep on top of debt

	- People embrace change with an S-curve profile (see Diffusion of Innovation).  
	  Start by inviting the innovators. Change is hardest at the beginning, with the most headwinds. 
	  
	  Think big, start small & start.
	  Run experiments, protecting from antibodies.
	  Share learning.

	- Lead, Leader, Leadership â‰  Command, Direct, Commit, Control 
	  
	  The origins of the word 'lead' is to ''guide on a journey''.
	  The origins of the workd 'command' comes from ''commit'' and ''mandate''.
	  
	  They are not mutually exclusive.

	- Install transparency: do you have a balanced set of data insights into the system of work, end-to-end?
	  Or is your org flying blind (or partially sighted)? 
	  
	  If it's not being measured, it's not possible to inspect & adapt and it's not possible to articulate progress.

	- Organisations are Complex Adaptive Systems
	  Be clear on the Why for change
	  Articulate a balanced set of measurable outcomes (desired direction)
	  Incentivse continous improvement
	  The only way to learn is by doing. Invite multiple experiments. 
	  How can I help?
	  Share Learning
