	- Pattern: three key roles at every level in the nested value streams, as equals: 
	  (1) Value Outcome Lead (What, value)
	  (2) Team Outcome Lead (How, system of work)
	  (3) Architecture Outcome Lead (How, business, data & tech)

	- People embrace change with an S-curve profile (see Diffusion of Innovation).  
	  Start by inviting the innovators. Change is hardest at the beginning, with the most headwinds.

	  Run experiments, protecting from antibodies.
	  Share learning.
