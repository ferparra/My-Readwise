document_note:: This episode of Huberman Lab features a conversation between Andrew Huberman and Dr. David Spiegel, a psychiatrist and director of the Center on Stress and Health at Stanford University School of Medicine, discussing the use of hypnosis to enhance mental and physical health and performance. Topics discussed include the difference between stage hypnosis and self-hypnosis, hypnotizability, the neuroscience of hypnosis, clinical applications of self-hypnosis, and how to begin self-hypnosis. It is noted that hypnosis can be used to treat chronic anxiety, chronic pain, trauma, stress, phobias, and even grief in cancer patients. It is also mentioned that the peak period of hypnotizability is between the ages of 6-10 years old, and that about 1/3 of adults are not hypnotizable, 2/3 are hypnotizable, with about 15% being extremely hypnotizable.

	  •   Direct eyes upward while open
	  •   Close your eyes, trying to keep the eyes up while closing the eyelids
