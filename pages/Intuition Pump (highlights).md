	- **Intuition pump** is a term coined by [Daniel Dennett](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett) to describe a [thought experiment](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Thought_experiment) which is intended to help a listener engage their [philosophical intuition](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Philosophical_intuition) and understand a philosophical question.

	- Dennett holds that intuition pumps, like analogies, should be used to illustrate an [argument](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argument), and not as an argument in and of themselves. The listener must be aware of the defects and limitations of their intrinsic philosophical intuition and not treat it as automatically reliable. As [Richard Feynman](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) put it, "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself â€” and you are the easiest person to fool."
