	- **Economic value:** You will want to gain an understanding of the economic value your proposition can drive for the customer:

	- **Alternatives:** The price or cost of alternatives is fundamental. This includes:

	- **Transaction data:** In cases where there is a high level of negotiation between sales teams and customers, and a history of transaction data to analyse, it is possible to identify patterns in the data which can be exploited.

	- **Usage data:** Understanding how customers use your proposition is critical to evaluating what aspects of it are most valuable and to whom. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhq9dyr8dsxj7z20spjrj39))
	- **Objectives:** The price you charge is a decision; your decision. You should therefore consider your commercial objectives when setting your prices. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmhq9ks10fs847fecbmsgnc5))
