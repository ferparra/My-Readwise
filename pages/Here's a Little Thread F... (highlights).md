	- Here's a little thread from behind the scenes in @figmadesign for how we created our last blog post media.
	  
	  If you haven't had a read of our latest blog post on how we handle no code reviews by default in the team, take a look ðŸ‘‰ https://t.co/W7RZRR0YFy

	- @figmadesign Firstly, we created the base circle layer â€“ black with 80% opacity, and some background blur â€“ and on top of that, added a white to black linear oval to the top and bottom of the base.
	  
	  This created the magnifying glass reflection effect we wanted.

	- @figmadesign Under those layers we added three types of inner shadows, using gradients, to create depth and bring in some of the colors from the wallpaper behind, to make it feel like they were part of the droplet.
	  
	  We've now gone from something flat, to a design with more dimensions.

	- @figmadesign To create the illusion that the text is warped in the droplet, we added the code snippet text in, and a radial blur layer on top â€“ from black to black â€“ to create a vignette effect.
	  
	  This made it feel like it was being magnified, and was the final piece to the graphic.

	- @figmadesign To finish off, we added in the text of the blog post to the media so that it stood out in social media posts and when it's shared externally, with a slight gradient to avoid using just a standard white piece of text. 
	  
	  And that's how we made the latest blog post media âœ¨
