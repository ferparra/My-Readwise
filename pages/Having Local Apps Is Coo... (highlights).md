	- Having local apps is cool, but no way you can hook em up to something like @make_hq because there's no web API. [[@logseq]] 0.8.15, "Hold my beer" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ToolsonTech/status/1608862707792633860))

	- So, with 0.8.15 you can run an http api server, from Logseq and then just use JSON api calls to change things. Here I'm just experimenting a bit using wget. But I could hook it up to Make, just need to setup something like an nginx proxy. https://t.co/RrFnwV9L9B ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ToolsonTech/status/1608862709554249728))
