	- [[Panpsychism]]
	  
	  Summary:
	  Panpsychism may be in contrast to aa naturalistic, dualism and other kind of views of [[consciousness]]. It agrees with the materialist that there's just the physical world, ultimately, there's just particles and fields. The panth panpsychist thinks there's there's more to the physical than what physical science reveals. So [[consciousness]] is not outside of the physical as the [[dualist]] thinks. it's embedded in ar underlies the kind of description of the world we get from physics.

	  It's a danger we've talked about a million times but let's try to sort of do that old basic terminology definitions what is panpsychism like what are the different ways you can try to think about to define panpsychism maybe in contrast to naturalistic dualism and materialism other kind of views of consciousness yeah so that you've basically laid out the different options so I guess probably still the dominant view is materialism that roughly that we can explain consciousness in in the terms of physical science we can only explain it just in terms of the electrochemical signaling in the brain dualism the polar opposite view that consciousness is non physical outside of the physical workings of the body in the brain although closely connected with the fluid philosophy we were taught basically they were the two options you had to choose right either you thought it were dualist And you thought it was separate from the physical or you thought it was just electrochemical signaling and yeah I became very disillusioned because I think there are big problems there's options so I think the attraction of panpsychism is it's kind of a middle way it agrees with the materialist that there's just a physical world ultimately there's just particles and fields but the pan panpsychist there's more to the physical than what physical science reveals and that the ultimate nature of the physical world is constituted of consciousness so consciousness is not outside of the physical as the dualist thinks it's embedded in underlies the kind of description of the world we get from physics what what are the problems of materialism and dualism starting with materialism I it's a huge debate but I think that the core of it is that physical science works with a purely Quantitative description of the physical world whereas consciousness essentially involves qualities if you think about the smell of coffee or the taste of mint or the deep red you experience as you watch a sunset I think these qualities can't be captured in the purely quantitative language of physical science and so as long as your description of the brain is framed in that purely quantitative descriptive quantitative language of neuroscience you'll just leave out these qualities and hence really leave out consciousness itself and then dualism so I've actually changed my mind a little bit on this since I wrote the book so I mean I argued in the book that we have pretty good experimental grounds for doubting dualism and roughly the idea was if dualism were true if there was say an immaterial mind impacting on the brain every second of waking life that this would really Show up in on neuroscience you know there'd be all sorts of things happening in the brain that had no physical explanation it would be like a poltergeist was playing with the brain actually and so the fact that we don't find that is a strong and ever-growing inductive argument against dualism but actually the more I talk to neuroscientists and read neuroscience and we have a Durham my university and interdisciplinary consciousness group I think we know enough about the brain about the workings of the brain to make ([Time 1:12:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/986bf024-261c-4437-9130-226c0b3784f9))
	- What Is Pansychism?
	  
	  Summary:
	  In its broadest definition, it's the view that consciousness is a fundamental ar and ub ous feature of the physical world. So i don't think that problem can be solved, for reasons i've kind of hinted out. The idea is basically, at the fundamental level of reality, there are just electrons and quargs. And the very complex experience of the uman or animal brain is somehow rooted in or derived from these simple forms of experience.

	  So in its broadest definition it's the view that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of the physical world like a law of physics what should we be imagining what do you think the different flavors of how that actually takes shape in the context of what we know about physics and the universe so in the simplest form of it the fundamental building blocks of reality perhaps electrons and quarks have incredibly simple forms of experience and the very complex experience of the human or animal brain is somehow rooted in or derived from these very simple forms of experience at the level of basic physics but I mean maybe the crucial bit about the kind of panpsychism I defend what it does is it takes the standard approach to the problem of consciousness and turns it on its head right so the standard approach is to think We start with matter and we think how do we get consciousness out of matter so I don't think that problem can be solved for reasons I've kind of hinted at we could maybe go into more detail but the panpsychist does it the other way around they start with consciousness and try to get matter out of consciousness so the idea is basically at the fundamental level of reality there ([Time 1:19:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dc495461-01f8-4fe3-b923-e8b314283542))
