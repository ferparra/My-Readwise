	- Conscious Experiences
	  
	  Summary:
	  The standard approach to [[consciousness]] is to figure out what complicated systems of matter with the right functional properties could possibly lead to the emergence of [[consciousness]]. Iht, so maybe you have to have neurons. Maybe only if you have neurons, but that might not be enough. They have certain kinds of complexity in their their organization and their dynamics,. Certain kinds of [[network]] abilities, for example. There are those who say, for example, [[consciousness]] arises from orchestrated collapse of [[quantum states]] of micro tubilsand in nurons.

	  Well, let me say first what most of my colleagues say. 99% are, again, assuming that space time is fundamental. Particles in space time matter is fundamental. And most are reductionist. And so the standard approach to consciousness is to figure out what complicated systems of matter with the right functional properties could possibly lead to the emergence of consciousness. That's the general idea. So maybe you have to have neurons. Maybe only if you have neurons, but that might not be enough. They have to certain kinds of complexity in their organization and their dynamics, certain kind of network abilities, for example. So there's, there are those who say, for example, that consciousness arises from orchestrated collapse of quantum states of microtubules and neurons. So this is a hammer off and kind of rose have this kind of. So it's a, you start with something physical, a property of quantum states of neurons, of microtubules and neurons, and you say that somehow an orchestrated collapse of those is consciousness or conscious experiences. Or integrated information theory. Again, you start with something physical. And if it has the right kind of functional properties, it's something they call phi with the right kind of integrated information, then you have consciousness. Or you can be a panpsychist, Philip Gough, for example, where you, you might say, well, in addition to the particles in space and time, those particles are not just matter. They also could have, say, a unit of consciousness. And so, but once again, you're taking space and time and particles is fundamental. And you're adding a new property to them, say, the consciousness. ([Time 1:33:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c57a8c01-38e1-44e5-8f57-2c0aa40533d2))
