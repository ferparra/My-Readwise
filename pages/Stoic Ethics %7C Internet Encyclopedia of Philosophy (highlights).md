	- Humans, unlike all other animals, are constituted by nature to develop reason as adults, which transforms their understanding of themselves and their own true good.
	- The Stoics held that virtue is the only real good and so is both necessary and, contrary to Aristotle, sufficient for happiness; it in no way depends on luck.
	- Stoicism is known as a eudaimonistic theory, which means that the culmination of human endeavor or ‘end’ (telos) is eudaimonia, meaning very roughly “happiness” or “flourishing.”
	- the Stoics’ metaphysical determinism further dictated that this cosmic Nature is identical to fate
	- conforming one’s will with the sequence of events that are fated to occur in the rationally constituted universe, as providentially willed by Zeus
	- theory of ‘appropriation,’ or oikeiôsis, a technical term which scholars have also translated variously as “orientation,” “familiarization,” “affinity,” or “affiliation.”  The word means the recognition of something as one’s own, as belonging to oneself.
	- The disposition to make a judgment disobedient to reason is the psychic disturbance the Stoics called passion (pathos)
	- The three ‘good states’ of the soul are joy (chara), caution (eulabeia), and wish (boulêsis).  Joy, the opposite of pleasure, is a reasonable elation; enjoyment, good spirits, and tranquility are classed under it.  Caution, the opposite of fear, is a reasonable avoidance.  Respect and sanctity are subtypes of caution.  Wish, the opposite of appetite, is a reasonable striving also described as good will, kindliness, acceptance, or contentment.
