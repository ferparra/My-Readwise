document_note:: In this episode of The Drive, Peter Attia and Bob Kaplan discuss how to read and understand scientific studies. They explain the different types of studies, from observational studies (non-intervention) to experimental studies (intervention) to meta-analyses and reviews. They also discuss the clinical trials process, which follows Phases I-IV and is regulated by the FDA. Finally, they discuss the importance of looking at each individual study to make sure they are sound.

	- Good science is hypothesis-driven ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9kq488rsd97ada4q527xtb))
	- Observational studies – no intervention, just looking at data and people to find patterns
	  
	  •   **Individual case report:** dive into one specific patient case that is driven by an observation that has not been studied before and can inform future treatment
	  •   **Case studies:** similar to individual case reports but with a larger set of patients
	  •   **Retrospective cohort study:** observational (not intervention) look back at a set of people who took part in ‘x’ and see how they are doing today versus people who did not take part in ‘x’
	  •   The goal of cohort studies is to establish a pattern and potentially determine casualty
	  •   **Prospective cohort study:** follow people who use ‘x’ over the next 5-10 years and compare them to people who do not use ‘x’ and observe outcomes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9kpqfftsmvkgy9kcs1fttn))
	- Experimental studies – intervention
	  
	  •   **Non-randomized trial (AKA open-label trial)**: two groups of people either given placebo or intervention but not randomized; grouping people based on certain characteristics
	    •   Comes with a lot of bias because there is a reason you put certain people in a group
	    •   Patients can also self-select into this type of study
	  •   **Randomized controlled trial:** the gold standard of experimental design; study the question but take bias out by randomly assigning people to treatment or control group ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9kptxqxbsyvpgfdhzvn42c))
	- **Meta-analyses:** combine data from multiple studies that are attempting to look at the same question
	  
	  •   This seems great on the surface but is highly dependent on the quality of the original studies: garbage in, garbage out – and vice versa
	  •   You can gain great insight from meta-analyses but take a closer look and examine each of the studies within the analyses ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv9kpz5zyz4tmhkjvzwk0krx))
