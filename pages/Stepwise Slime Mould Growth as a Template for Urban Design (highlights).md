	- Physarum polycephalum, develops as a vascular network of protoplasm, connecting node-like sources of food in an effort to solve multi-objective transport problems
	- Resolved vascular morphologies are the result of an evolutionarily-refined mechanism of computation, which can serve as a versatile biological model for network design at the urban scale.
	- The biological principles that underpin the organization of this system have undergone thousands of cycles of evolution, and can provide fundamental insights for dealing with complex networking problems of our own (e.g., road planning21,32, railway planning20, wireless sensor routing33), and particularly at the scale of the city.
