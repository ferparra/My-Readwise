	- The Deconstructive Nature of Nicolson's Poems
	  
	  Summary:
	  i think the iambic metre is lovely because it's so conversational. He uses words literally to take words apart, he talks to himself and chastises himself sometimes for being clumsy. I regard his poetry as a kind of antidote to the modern madness that we see going on with extremism in islam. Most people who have perhaps dropped established religion still admire spiritualitys concept.

	  Wy, you've been pretin to fo, you haven't readyou haven't read nicholson's i soi min that's a great complimentd and it is a matter of translating it, not just from a persian into english. It's a matter of translating it from from a century that we're so out of touch with, to into our mind. And i think the iambic metre is lovely because it's so conversational and it has so many registers it can, it can do comedy, and it can do tragedy, and it can do farce, and it can do contemplation. What i wanted to say in the programme, which it's probably good that it didn't go in, is i wanted to talk about the deconstructive nature of his poetry. For any literary listener, this is an extraordinary feature of his poetry, which makes exciting reading for anyone interested in poetry, is that he uses words literally to take words apart. And in fact, he talks to himself and chastises himself sometimes for being clumsy. But, you know, tht that probably couldn't have come across. And the other thing is that, as carroll says, he was an amazingly er carism i and unitive figure. And conie, he brought people together. And i i regard the masnovy and the rest of his poetry, but particularly the masnovy as a kind of antidote to the modern madness that we see going on with extremism in islam. Thoug he never made that point, did wewould have done about how it's a a aversion, an attitude, a demonstration of islam completely different kind.

	  And at the moment, i think most people who have perhaps dropped established religion still admire spiritualitys concept and that's why his all embracing attitude to spiritualities is so relevant to us to day. I think. ([TimeÂ 0:43:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/21008ee8-591b-45bd-b1cd-78db87b4481d))
