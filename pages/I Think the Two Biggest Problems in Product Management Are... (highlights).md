	- I think the two biggest problems in product management are...
	  
	  1. Far too much Work in Progress.
	  
	  2. An infinite backlog. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwpakgbrwmdyz03kw9kwzz2))
	- making one or two huge product leaps every quarter, you're advancing on dozens of different fronts, but finishihg almost none of them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwpb689yy1eyyqnp2hshf9s))

	- it's so much easier to add something to a backlog than deliver it from the backlog. As such the backlog continually grows much faster than you can service it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwpbnzjbagz2qkdxc9ayb2s))

	- create product management processes (i.e. governance) that limits a) how many things you can be working on concurrently and b) prevents the backlog from growing out of control. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwpdhfy2tgzgz4bk8kwstvz))
