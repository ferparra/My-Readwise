	- Euler’s proof is surprisingly simple. He reasoned that each time we enter and leave a region, we must cross two bridges. So every landmass must have an even number of bridges. Because every landmass in Königsberg had an odd number of bridges, no such round trip was possible. Likewise, the three bridges to Herrs Island in the Allegheny River make a bicycle circuit of Pittsburgh mathematically impossible.
