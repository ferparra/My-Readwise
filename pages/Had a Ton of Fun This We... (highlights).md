	- Had a ton of fun this weekend building a demo project: PapersGPT. It enables you to feed any scientific papers into GPT to give it deep customized knowledge. Moreover, it’s a proof-of-concept UX of the end goal of connecting arbitrary data.

	- GPT does not have access to the internet or any external data. This demo works by downloading the papers, extracting text, indexing it with embeddings, and recursively feeding specific chunks/prompts into GPT. Try the examples of @karpathy’s papers or @paulg's blog posts. [2/4] ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejessezhang/status/1615390913882386433))
	- Huge shoutout to the awesome work of @jerryjliu0! It was super fun ramping up on @gpt_index and starting to contribute a tiny bit. The backend is built around GPT Index and I’m hosting my own small Flask server. [3/4] ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejessezhang/status/1615391088277336066))
	- Next steps I’m excited to implement:
	- @SubstackInc @ravithejads Please suggest any ideas or additions! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejessezhang/status/1615391481149419520))
	- Ah forgot to mention that @LangChainAI (wonderful package) is also used! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejessezhang/status/1615392598457450496))
