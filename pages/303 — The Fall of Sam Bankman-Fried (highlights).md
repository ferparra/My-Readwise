	- Altruism - The Second Principle
	  
	  Summary:
	  effective altruism represents a clear-eyed view of what it takes to do good in the world. But prior to EA, most philanthropy seem to be basically blind to any rational metrics of success. The second principle is that there's a difference between causes that make us feel good and those that reduce suffering and death most effectively.

	  But prior to EA, most philanthropy seem to be basically blind to any rational metrics of success. In fact, many charities are governed by perverse incentives. They can't afford to solve the problem they're ostensibly committed to solving because then they would go out of business. Effective altruism, at least in principle, represents a clear-eyed view of what it takes to do good in the world and to prioritize the most effective ways of doing that good. The second principle, which more or less follows directly from the first, is that there's a difference between causes that make us feel good, that are sexy and subjectively rewarding to support, and those that reduce suffering and death most effectively. As I've discussed many times on the podcast, we are easily moved by a compelling story, particularly one with a single sympathetic protagonist, and we tend not to be moved at all by statistics. So if you tell me that one little girl fell down a well, and I can do something to save her right now, well, I'm going to do more or less whatever it takes, especially if that girl lives just a few blocks away from my home. But if you tell me that 10,000 little girls fall down wells every year and most of them live in Tanzania, I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

	- Is Utilitarianism Good?
	  
	  Summary:
	  People are linking Bankman Free's behavior to the ethical philosophy of utilitarianism, as though belief in this philosophy was bound to produce such behavior. But if these consequences are worth caring about, they can be included in any fuller picture of consequentialism. My point is that everyone really is some form of consequentialist, even if they think they're not. You just have to listen to them talk long enough and they start telling you about the consequences they really care about.

	  The other crazy thing I'm seeing is that people are linking Bankman Free's behavior to the ethical philosophy of utilitarianism, as though belief in this philosophy was bound to produce such behavior. And everything I've heard said or seen written about this is pretty confused. I'm sure I'll talk more about this on future podcasts, because it's important to get straight, but the short point I'll make here is that in my view, the claim that utilitarianism, or more properly consequentialism, is bad, amounts to a claim that it has bad consequences of some sort. But of course, if these consequences are worth caring about, they can be included in any fuller picture of consequentialism. My point, and I made this at length in my book, The Moral Landscape, which remains the most misunderstood book I've ever written, my point is that everyone really is some form of consequentialist, even if they think they're not. You just have to listen to them talk long enough, and they start telling you about the consequences they really care about. Deontology, for instance, aversion-like cons, categorical imperative, or virtue ethics, right? I think these positions entail covert claims about the consequences of certain ways of thinking or acting or being in the world.
