	- Quarterly OKRs tracked monthly are KPIs.
	  
	  Seems that we all agree on the alignment benefits of OKRs, but its second job is to help teams make better decisions _during_ the quarterâ€”hardly the case if tracked monthly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stenpittet/status/1427487302276706305))
	- One of the danger of OKRs is to become too obsessed with the KRs and lose track of the Objectives.

	- PSA: don't cascade your OKRs next quarter
	  
	  It looks great in theory, but it rarely works in practice.
