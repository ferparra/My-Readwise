	  1.  Three core mechanisms to help translate the principles into action include the annual goal setting, the S team goalsetting plan and annual compensation packages to tie customer service with rewards. These operating plans are meant to intertwine the individual and company goals so that everything is self reinforcing and mutually beneficial. This takes tremendous planning and effort but it helps align every one in the organization.
	  2.  Amazon is different in the sense that the senior team focuses relentlessly on execution and details, not just strategy.

		- **Note**: Single threaded leadership is a system used by Amazon for combating the friction that comes with becoming a large organization. It involves assigning one person to head an autonomous team that solely focuses on a major initiative, and this person is responsible and accountable for it. It is important not to make the initiative a part-time job in order to increase the chances of success.
	- **Be aware of where their exist dependencies - whether technical, organizational, or otherwise - that slow you and your progress down as you have to rely on others to accomplish what you need.** Too many dependencies are said to be tightly coupled. Amazon had to shift to small, autonomous teams but are now famous two pizza rule.

		- **Note**: At Amazon, the teams are small and independent so they can move quickly and still offer great products. They have a rule called the "two pizza rule", which means that if a team is too big, it can be split into smaller teams. This way, teams don't have to wait for other teams to finish their work before they can start theirs. That way, they can get things done faster and more efficiently.
	- Two pizza themes are most effective in product development and each team is given specific metrics that are agreed-upon which helps keep everyone aligned and on task.
