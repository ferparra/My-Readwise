	- Plenty of people are pointing out the big repricing in valuations we've seen this year, which makes stocks look visually ''cheap'' on a multi-year basis.
	  
	  But equity valuations should not be looked at in a silo.
	  
	  A short thread on the valuations of the stock market.

	- I built several metrics to try and gauge the equity risk premium, and I will show you my preferred one here.
	  
	  The chart below shows the difference between the 12-month forward earnings yield for the SPX (P/E in reverse) against 5y forward, 5y US real interest rates.
	  
	  Why?

	- Because investors always have a choice between allocating capital in a risk-free instrument and in several risk assets - for which they expect to be compensated.
	  
	  Hence, looking at S&P valuations in a silo makes little sense; instead, the focus should be on...

	- ...what's the additional expected return I can generate on top of the risk-free real yield I can get from investing in US Treasuries.
	  
	  Why 12-month forward earnings yield?
	  And why 5y5y forward real rates as the risk-free alternative?

	- The 12m forward earnings yield allows me to incorporate earnings expectations into the cake
	  
	  When investing in stocks, your total return is driven by valuation changes but also by EPS growth so incorporating that in my analysis gives me a cleaner look at the multiples' side

	- Large-cap companies generally have a decent pricing power. 
	  
	  That allows them to incorporate most of the inflationary pressures into earnings without hugely affecting margins, which is why one might consider their future cash flows as ''real'' cash flows to a certain extent

	- That is the reason why I look at 12m forward SPX earnings yield and compare it to forward real interest rates.
	  
	  Plenty of assumptions of course, but it's a good rough measure of the equity risk premium out there.
	  
	  How does it look today?

	- The lines in the chart show 1 standard deviation bands for a 15-year history: that includes 2006, the GFC, the taper tantrum, QE, Covid.
	  
	  The whole bunch.
	  
	  1-sigma cheap > 6.5%
	  1-sigma rich < 4.5%
	  
	  Today: 5.3%

	- What the heck, Alf?
	  
	  The stock market sold off 15%+ and still this equity risk premium measure is right in the middle of a 15y range?
	  
	  Yes, because real yields sold off incredibly fast hence providing a good risk-free alternative to park cash.

	- Stock market valuations shouldn't be looked at in a silo
	  
	  In my next piece on https://t.co/HtlHaKOguK I will discuss pricing across asset classes and where I see decent risk/reward opportunities for the medium term
