	- 1. Fix your posture
	  
	  Don't want to look like a croissant? Bar hangs help strengthen & mobilize your upper body.
	  
	  They also provide a constant stretch on the shoulders, back arms & lats.
	  
	  This helps reverse upper body posture defects that come from sitting for too long. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1605202249180921856))
	- 2. Grip strength
	  
	  Your weight is supported first by the grip of your hand.
	  
	  A good grip improves your performance across all exercises like the pull-up, rows, deadlifts...any exercise requiring a grip.
	  
	  It also makes daily activities easier like handshakes & opening jars. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1605202251265482755))
	- 3. Live longer
	  
	  Grip strength can be a biomarker for your inner age & determines your mobility & strength as you get older.
	  
	  In some studies, decreased grip strength is associated with accelerated biological age.
	  
	  Want to live longer? Do bar hangs to improve your grip strength. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1605202253391994880))
	- 4. Stronger shoulders
	  
	  Bar hangs can improve mobility, and strengthen the shoulders & lats while reducing shoulder pain.
	  
	  They stretch the brachial muscles while strengthening the supraspinatus tendon, which is responsible for shoulder strength & endurance. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1605202255350743041))
	- There are 2 ways to do bar hangs:
	  
	  #1 Passive hang
	  
	  Take an overhand grip. Let shoulders & lats relax.
	  
	  Your body should sink with shoulders touching your ears.
	  
	  Hang there with feet slightly forward, core braced & let your weight passively stretch your shoulders, lats, & back. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1605202257443803139))
	- #2 Active hang
	  
	  Start in a passive hang. 
	  
	  Retract your shoulder blades down and away from your ears. Stop retracting when your ears reach your elbows. Hold for as long as you can.
	  
	  This puts more emphasis on the muscles in your shoulders and back. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1605202259465441284))
	- How long should you do bar hangs?
	  
	  If you're a beginning aim for 10 seconds to start.
	  
	  Work your way up to 45 seconds to one minute at a time.
	  
	  Repeat for 3 sets.
	  
	  As long as you're not sore you can do these daily. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1605202261386354690))
	- What if you can't hang from a bar?
	  
	  You can step on a box at first to help support your weight.
	  
	  Another way is to attach a resistance band to the bar putting while putting your feet on it.
	  
	  If available you can use also use an assisted pull-up machine to support your weight. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1605202263454031872))
