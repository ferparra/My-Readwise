	- Probably the craziest thing about all of this for me is that my piece on the book has gotten >250k views by now and still not a single neuroscientist or sleep scientist commented meaningfully on the merits of my accusations. Only Andrew Gelman (a statistician) picked them up. https://t.co/t1UsofXSh2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1426273130138546179))

	- Sometimes scientists wrote to me directly though. One prominent sleep scientist wrote: "I was so infuriated by the Walker claims that I bought a copy of the book so that I could review it ... I found it so full of falsehoods, lightly tossed out, that I didnâ€™t know where to start"

	- 1. A famous scientist at UC Berkeley is accused of horribly misrepresenting the state of research in the field in a book that sold millions of copies
	  2. The accusations get >250k of views
	  3. The field: *crickets*
	  
	  What is this if not extreme intellectual decay of academia? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1426277179319533579))
	- If my accusations are without merit, where are the debunkings of them? I'm literally just a rando who read the book because a friend recommended it and maybe I'm wrong.
	  
	  If my accusations are correct, why has nobody in the field spoken against Walker publicly? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1426277837485617161))
	- I don't really expect anything to happen at this point. According to UC Berkeley, "there were some minor errors in the book, which Walker intends to correct". The case is closed. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1426278792604041218))
	- This is one of the things that really convinces me that we do need to build *new* institutions of basic science. The feedback loops that are supposed to reward people who seek truth and to punish charlatans are just completely broken.
