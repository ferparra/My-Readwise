	- Today I saw the impact that AlphaFold is having on speeding up drug discovery firsthand: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/russelljkaplan/status/1485191271840837633))

	- 1/ A friend runs a biotech startup designing drugs to fight cancer. In prior work, they found that tumor cells make a protein that binds to two receptors in the body. Binding to just one of them would inhibit the tumor’s growth, but binding to both makes the tumor grow faster. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/russelljkaplan/status/1485191273178800129))
	- 2/ If they could design a new protein that binds to only one receptor and not the other, this mutant protein might be a potent cancer drug. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/russelljkaplan/status/1485191274369994759))
	- 3/ Before AlphaFold, finding such a protein would take ~1 month: order lots of mutated DNA sequences, insert them into cells, filter the cells which bind to one receptor but not the other, and sequence those cells’ DNA.

	- 4/ AlphaFold unlocked a different approach: it found the 3D structure of the existing protein & receptors, which was unknown. With the structure + another ML model, they saw how binding affinities would change with different mutations. This led to an ideal candidate in 8 hours.

	- 5/ Animal trials with this new protein will start soon. Still a long way to an approved drug, but it’s exciting to see drug discovery go faster with a neural network in a Colab notebook. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/russelljkaplan/status/1485191277717032964))
