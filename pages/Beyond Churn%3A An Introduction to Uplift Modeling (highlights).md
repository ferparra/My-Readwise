	- Uplift modeling can supplement experimental data from A/B testing by identifying the incremental impact on particular individuals of a specific treatment, as opposed to the overall lift or decrease caused by a treatment. This technique may help you assess whether other attributes of those individuals (e.g., demographic characteristics) could help explain their response. This nuanced analysis allows for future targeting only of those most likely to respond positively to a treatment.
