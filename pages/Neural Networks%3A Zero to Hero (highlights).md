- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Apr 7th, 2023]]
	- A course by Andrej Karpathy on building neural networks, from scratch, in code. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcfvheg73397sb4z7gaxc11))
	- We start with the basics of backpropagation and build up to modern deep neural networks, like GPT. In my opinion language models are an excellent place to learn deep learning, even if your intention is to eventually go to other areas like computer vision because most of what you learn will be immediately transferable. This is why we dive into and focus on languade models. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcfvma1yyszwjb87qqq0e4b))
	- Prerequisites: solid programming (Python), intro-level math (e.g. derivative, gaussian). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcfvp0qbn4xk8wxpdnp752b))
	- This is the most step-by-step spelled-out explanation of backpropagation and training of neural networks. It only assumes basic knowledge of Python and a vague recollection of calculus from high school. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcfvf53vpwedwykq7k4j45s))
