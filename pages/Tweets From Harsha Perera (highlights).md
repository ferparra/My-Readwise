	- @Marufkhon @nntaleb What I try to do:
	  Embrace the artisanal life.
	  Avoid faceless institutions.
	  Shop local.
	  Know your neighbours.
	  Don't scale community/political affairs unless needed for coordination/ to manage systemic risks.
	  
	  Check out Taleb's Incerto (particularly [[Antifragile]] & [[Skin in the Game]]) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/harshacoach/status/1452290291084533764))
	- Marx's idea of "alienation" — separation of worker from product — is really about the problems of SCALE. Applies to alienation of:
	  
	  Consumer from producer
	  Citizen from elected
	  Citizen from citizen
	  
	  Greater the separation, greater the loss of our humanity.
