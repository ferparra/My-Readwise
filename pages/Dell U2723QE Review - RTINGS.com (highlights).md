	- The Dell U2723QE has a DisplayPort Out port if you want to daisy chain a second monitor. It sends 4k @ 60Hz signals with 10-bit color depth without any problems to a second display if your graphics card supports Display Stream Compression (DSC). It also has an RJ45 Ethernet port, allowing you to connect directly to the monitor if your laptop doesn't have an Ethernet port, and it works without issues.
