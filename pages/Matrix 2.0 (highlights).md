	- Matrix is an open standard for secure, decentralised communication, which may be familiar from powering the online editions of FOSDEM in 2021 and 2022 (and hybrid-FOSDEM this year!). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx21qhcczrv63nx591g5w50c))
		- **Note**: Matrix 2.0 is a major update to the open standard for secure, decentralised communication, which powers the online editions of FOSDEM. The update makes Matrix at least as fast as the fastest proprietary messaging apps while also handling thousands of rooms spanning millions of users. It includes changes to data syncing, room joins, authentication, and VoIP, and introduces the new matrix-rust-sdk client SDK which powers the new flagship mobile Matrix client.
