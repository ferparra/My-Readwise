	- 9 uncomfortable truths about engineering and tech right now. 
	  
	  How Twitter might play out, the ramifications, and what Elon’s calculus might be.
	  
	  Disclaimer: Don’t shoot the messenger. I’m relaying observations through a lens of engineering for over a decade & managing engineers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1593705261939802112))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1. Small engineering teams move much faster than big teams. Obvious, but it still needs to be said.
	  
	  Elon has factored this in.
	  
	  2. If you are willing to throw out large chunks of a system, you can rebuild the core parts in a fraction of the time with great people. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1593705310069305344))
	- 3. The domain complexity with Twitter is in the distributed system. There is little valuable domain knowledge in the core functionality. Losing people hurts Elon less than we might think.
	  
	  Rebuilding Twitter today is far easier than it was initially initially. See Gas. https://t.co/Zqht5GSkny ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1593705311717703680))
	- Side Note: 
	  
	  Domain Knowledge is still valuable.
	  
	  Take Pharmacy tech, which I recently worked on. Tons of state-by-state regulations, drug interactions, compliance, HIPAA, etc., Very different than the complexity we had at Jet building eCommerce. It has that and more. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1593705315282964488))
	- 4. Tech is not the moat it used to be.
	  
	  So much of what Big Tech does has been commoditized and is now off the shelf. 
	  
	  Engineering teams today can do in a fraction of the time what took Netflix years and years to accomplish before. https://t.co/tMMcym12WH ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1593705316847423492))
	- 5. Even most of Big Tech’s domain knowledge is commoditized.
	  
	  How to do search is known.
	  How to stream video is known.
	  How to build social graphs is known.
	  How to do eCommerce is known.
	  
	  People moved around and taught each other. Elon is banking; he can rehire this knowledge. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1593705319355613190))
	- A side note: 
	  
	  The majority of Big Tech might not recover what it lost this year.
	  
	  Without tech moats, startups in many niches can be spun up seemingly overnight & eat away at their dominance.
	  
	  Look at how fast TikTok came up under FBs nose. Also, see how fast Gas is moving. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1593705321545011201))
	- 6. Engineers are deeply attracted to tough problems.
	  
	  It’s like catnip. As an engineer it was my achilles heel. As a manager it was my strongest selling point.
	  
	  So you can imagine that rebuilding Twitter, will probably attract a lot of engineers. Elon knows this too. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1593705323713294336))
	- 7. Engineers still have tons of options. 
	  
	  Including the option of taking lower pay for remote work & better work-life balance. And working at a startup or a mid-tier firm.
	  
	  At least as of now, it seems Elon miss-calculated this a little & lost more people than he intended. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1593705325919617024))
	- Another side note:
	  
	  In the worst case, if willing to throw away, for a while, things like:
	- 8. Rewrites in tech are more common than many think.
	  
	  Many tech-driven firms, after acquisitions, end up re-writing large chunks of their system.
	  
	  Again, Elon seems to be banking that he could have the core functionality rebuilt for scale with a small team if he had to. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1593705330021736448))
	- 9. If this doesn’t fall apart, there will be intense pressure on Big Tech to downsize much more after this.
	  
	  If Elon can let go of 90% of the staff and things keep going and can be rebuilt better, you can bet investors will put insane pressure on them. https://t.co/DQHhApPWUb ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1593705331582025735))
	- I’m convinced that what’s happening at Twitter is one of the most important things to happen to our industry in a long time.
	  
	  Not just because Twitter itself is important, which it is.
	  
	  But it has far-reaching ramifications for the entire industry. And especially for Big Tech. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1593705334241042432))
