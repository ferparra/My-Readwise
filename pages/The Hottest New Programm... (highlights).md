	- The hottest new programming language is English ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1617979122625712128))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- This tweet went wide, thought I'd post some of the recent supporting articles that inspired it.
	  1/ GPT-3 paper showed that LLMs perform in-context learning, and can be "programmed" inside the prompt with input:output examples to perform diverse tasks  https://t.co/HhrwtYNTOd

	- 2/ These two [1] https://t.co/r8AJ1zu2Cb , [2] https://t.co/HmREob6yIB are good examples that the prompt can further program the "solution strategy", and with a good enough design of it, a lot more complex multi-step reasoning tasks become possible.

	- 3/ These two articles/papers: 
	  [1] https://t.co/qfWnkIQuIt 
	  [2] https://t.co/jeo4y8yZzD 
	  bit more technical but TLDR good prompts include the desired/aspiring performance. GPTs don't "want" to succeed. They want to imitate. You want to succeed, and you have to ask for it.

	- 4/ Building A Virtual Machine inside ChatGPT  https://t.co/nAFjlSczlD
	  Here we start getting into specifics of "programming" in English. Take a look at the rules and input/output specifications declared in English, conditioning the GPT into a particular kind of role. Read in full.

	- 5/ "ChatGPT in an iOS Shortcut â€” Worlds Smartest HomeKit Voice Assistant" https://t.co/yNTOorIInZ 
	  This voice assistant is significantly more capable and personalized than your regular Siri/Alexa/etc., and it was programmed in English.

	- 6/ "GPT is all you need for the backend" https://t.co/Wu7XOqFHbi
	  Tired: use an LLM to help you write a backend
	  Wired: LLM is the backend
	  Inspiring project from a recent Scale hackathon. The LLM backend takes state as JSON blob and modifies it based on... English description.

	- 7/ The prompt allegedly used by Bing chat, potentially spilled by a prompt injection attack https://t.co/U8c9NccDHf important point for our purposes is that the identity is constructed and programmed in English, by laying out who it is, what it knows/doesn't know, and how to act.

	- 8/ These examples illustrate how prompts 1: matter and 2: are not trivial, and why today it makes sense to be a "prompt engineer" (e.g. @goodside ). I also like to think of this role as a kind of LLM psychologist.

	- 9/ Pulling in one more relevant tweet of mine from a while ago. GPTs run natural language programs by completing the document.

	- This is not an exhaustive list (people can add more in replies), but at least some of the articles I saw recently that stood out.
	  
	  It's still early days but this new programming paradigm has the potential to  expand the number of programmers to ~1.5B people. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1627366429489266689))
