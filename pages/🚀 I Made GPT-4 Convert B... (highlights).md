	- ðŸš€ I made GPT-4 convert BabyAGI to TypeScript, so @yoheinakajima doesn't have to.
	  
	  Introducing BabyAGI-ts: a CLI tool that can be installed as a global NPM module and used to create and manage BabyAGI agents.
	  
	  Code Here ðŸ‘‡

	- @yoheinakajima BabyAGI is a super powerful tool. When I first started experimenting with it, I was surprised at the high overhead to get it running. 
	  
	  This gave me the idea to make a version that was easy to install so curious devs could start to play around. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xSamHogan/status/1647405010601512960))
	- @yoheinakajima I've also been having fun making GPT-4 rewrite small projects from (mostly) Python to TypeScript. BabyAGI was only ~300 lines of code, which makes it a good candidate for this. The total process took about 5 hours from the initial idea to right now :) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xSamHogan/status/1647405395034664960))
