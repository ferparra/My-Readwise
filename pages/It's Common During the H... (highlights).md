	- It's common during the handoff process to provide screens to our engineering teammates by "throwing designs over the fence"
	  
	  We've all been there!
	  
	  This puts pressure on devs to play a game of spot the difference, finding minor changes between screens ðŸ”Ž
	  
	  We can simplify this ðŸ“£

	- The red circles are the true differences, sooooo why are we duplicating *everything* from each screen?
	  
	  This is inefficient from both sides:
	  â€“ Designer must track identical screens, with changes doubled* every time there's a modification
	  â€“ Developer is playing spot the difference

	- Let's remove duplicate screens!
	  
	  Instead, we can show *component* differences alongside the main screen
	  
	  Then group them with a section & use component labels to describe the differences
	  
	  The developers then just need to look at one template, and read the component differences ðŸª„

	- Let's look for a practical example
	  
	  Here's the Target product listing page, sliced up to show the delivery toggle options
	  
	  Thanks for asking about this one @jgdesignz
