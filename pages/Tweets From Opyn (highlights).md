	- Reasons to SELL a PUT option:
	  
	  You can earn income in return for the protection you provide. You keep the entirety of your premium as well as your collateral (USDC) as long as the asset stays above the strike price ($15) until expiry ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/opyn_/status/1411492669092663296))
	- Reasons to BUY a CALL option:
