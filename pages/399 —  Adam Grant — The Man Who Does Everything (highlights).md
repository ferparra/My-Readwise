	  I think that you need to see those through other people's eyes too. So i havee some colleagues who develop this great tool at the university michigan. It's called the reflected best self exercise. And ii have have all my students do it, mba, undergrad, senior executives, every one in between and ty. They often come back and say it was eye opening and occasionally even life changing. What what you do is you reach out to usually 15 to 20 people who know you well. You get to choose them, often different walks of life. So some colleagues may be a boss, a friend, a family member. And you ask them to tell a story about a time when you were at your best. And you collect all these stories, it is the most delightful week of females you will ever gethha, haha. This is how amazing you are, again and again, again. Ha. But then you have some work to do. You have to analyze the stories and find the common themes and figure out, ok, what is the portrait of me when i'm at my best? And what is it that activates those strengths? And i first did this my first year at grad school. And i i learned thathat. Apparently i didn't realize this, but one of my strengths was actually recognizing other people's strengths. It showed up in almost every story was, you know, i was at my best when i was helping soe else be at their best. And so i said, i've got to make that part of my job. I have to figure out a way to do that, because i love it, and people are telling me that i'm good at it, or at least that they like it. And i never would have tougt of that. I ust did not cross my mind. And so it's an exercise i like to see people do, i think, every couple of years, because sometimes you have new people in your life who see different strengths. Your strengths evolve. You find new ways to activate them. And i'm a big fan in that exercise. I love it. ([Time 1:34:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/736498db-d3e4-459f-9845-394ca6bb7d9c))
