	  In that sense, empathy usually popularly used means that you care like your happiness is aligned. I need to read this book. I've read so little science fiction. There's been one of my goals for this year to catch up on some science fiction. So Robert Heiland from Stranger in the Strange Land has this quote about love, which is love is that condition where another person's happiness is essential to your own. So that's a good definition, I guess, of empathy where you're very sensitive, so mechanistically very sensitive to the state of another person's mind. And your goal is to maximize their happiness. It's like essential to your own happiness. So the happinesses are aligned. And when that's elevated to its highest forms, you can call that love, romantic love, friendship, and so on.

	  Okay. There's one more thing about the narcissist is some people can be sort of benign narcissists where they want great things for themselves. But if they have enough great things, they can sort of tolerate others being happy to. And these are people who sometimes are actually quite highly liked, right? Because they have to have the most money, the most power, the most of anything, anything more than anyone else could challenge. But as long as I have that, it's okay that you have some too, right? And then that can make you happy and can make you like me, right? So benign narcissists can be well liked from that perspective. But it's still all about them. And that can change if, for example, there's a scarcity of resources now, right? But they're generally, they're not people who are being overtly destructive. Although that they're over the border into the, you know, into the envy territory, right? Malignant narcissists are very different where they then want to have everything. So they so even if I have 1000 times more than you, do I still envy you what you have? Because I want to have, I don't think I can feel good enough about myself unless I have everything. And once I have everything, I won't feel good enough about myself either. And then I'll have to have more, right? It's like, that's malignant narcissism, which we think of as sociopathy, right? As we can, we can define these words in different ways, but they're very, very negative concepts, you know, it's that's that's profound sociopathy, malignant narcissism, you know, envy writ large.
