document_note:: OKRs are a collaborative goal setting structure used to drive good ideas forward, providing clarity, transparency, and accountability. They are meant to help communicate, measure, and achieve lofty goals. There are four superpowers of OKRs: Focus, Align, Track, and Stretch (FATS). Focus helps set objectives and clear benchmarks for success, Align helps teams move quickly with clarity of priorities, Track helps monitor and adjust goals, and Stretch is about pushing for 10x improvement. CFR (Conversation, Feedback, Recognition) also works hand-in-hand with OKRs to boost performance. Lastly, it is important to have rules, buy-in from the top, and to establish ambitious yet realistic objectives.

	- Focus
	  
	  1.  Setting objectives gives people a clear path on what to work on and what success looks like. Key results help indicate success and progress since there is a clear benchmark for what 'success' means for each objective
	  2.  When people help set the objectives they are more likely to follow through
	  3.  Hand-in-hand with focus is a deep commitment. If you waiver or switch priorities often, you will waste time and confuse your team
	  4.  **Objectives should be one line and clearly understandable. The key results must be objective and measurable** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsnsxy5k8w2v4qhakp5m2y5e))
		- **Note**: Objectives and key results should be established to give people a clear path and understanding of what they should work on and what success looks like. People should be involved in setting these objectives to ensure commitment and focus. Objectives should be one line and understandable, while key results should be objective and measurable.
	- Align
	  
	  1.  **OKRs allow teams to move very quickly as it is clear what the priorities are and ensures everybody is moving in the same direction**
	  2.  Transparency is the key and modern goal setting people allow people to buy in and gives management has a clear idea of what people are working on and why.
	  3.  Objectives get people to flush out their hesitations or frustrations which helps foster communication and collaboration.
	  4.  Alignment is extremely important but hard to come by and is the biggest lever to go from strategy to execution - if people don’t know the business model and what they’re doing to help the company succeed, it is hard for them to go all-in and know what they’re supposed to be working on.
	  5.  In addition, this transparency allows for the whole company to weigh in on the best objectives. The best objectives tend to come outside the C-suite, coming from the front line employees who have the best access to accurate information and changing trends.
	  6.  You also get more people thinking about the same problems - flushing out ideas, making connections that otherwise might not have been made, and getting cross-division collaboration ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsnsyj488sd2v1j2th4abamt))
		- **Note**: OKRs are a goal setting strategy that allows teams to move quickly, be transparent, and align everyone in the same direction. It encourages communication and collaboration and allows for the whole company to weigh in on the best objectives. It also encourages cross-division collaboration and more people thinking about the same problems. This helps foster a culture of strategy to execution, allowing people to understand the business model and what they are working on to help the company succeed.
	- Track
	  
	  1.  **OKRs are living and breathing goals, evolving and adapting with the needs of the company.** **OKRs are meant to be adaptive guardrails, not strict rules to follow.**
	  2.  The OKRs have to be visible and related to daily, or else they fade into irrelevance.
	  3.  Making progress in public goals is one of people's most motivating factors. You need to write them down and follow up on them often
	  4.  The constant monitoring and making sure that you're working on the right thing at the right time is more important than the actual objectives  
	    
	  5.  Expectations are easier to set across groups and fewer surprises can be expected when OKRs are set and tracked accordingly
	  6.  Post-mortem: OKRs aren't done even when completed. You can go through a post-mortem: objective scoring (are the objectives themselves valuable and correct?
	  7.  Google measures each one in a 0 to 1 scale, with anything above .7 being considered successful, subjective self-assessment, and reflection (what contributed to success, what obstacles did I face) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsnszd0za9as1cpn9czne9qn))
		- **Note**: OKRs are goal-oriented metrics that are meant to be adaptive and visible, so that progress can be tracked and measured accordingly. They should be followed up on often and a post-mortem should be conducted when they are completed, including objective scoring, subjective self-assessment, and reflection on success and obstacles. Google measures OKRs on a 0 to 1 scale, with anything above .7 being considered successful.
	- Stretch
	  
	  1.  Google adheres to and goes after the 10 X improvement. It requires a new way of thinking and a lot of courage to go for 1000% change vs. a 10% change
	  2.  A stretch goal cannot seem like a long arch to nowhere and it cannot be imposed from the top down, with no basing in reality. Employee buy-in is essential and leaders have to show that they think the objective is important and obtainable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsnsztd0yfah57tp1p7w656a))
		- **Note**: This document explains that Google uses the 10X improvement approach and encourages employees to set stretch goals. For the goals to be effective, they must be based in reality and have the support of leaders who must show that they believe the objectives are achievable. Employee buy-in is also essential for success.
	- •   **Conversation - Feedback - Recognition**
	  •   **OKRs set the direction and give clarity, CFRs provide the fuel to get there.** They work hand-in-hand and help boost each other up. Continuous performance management rather than quarterly or annually
	  •   **A manager's first job is a personal one - to build a deep and trusting relationship with all of their people**. The quarterly feedback which is common and most companies is outdated and eats up a lot of time.
	  •   CFR is an updated way to give your people feedback - building trust and pushing them to learn and grow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsnt2jge1sd2565gw9yp76zn))
		- **Note**: Measure What Matters promotes the idea of using OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and CFRs (Continuous Feedback and Recognition) together in order to drive 10x growth. OKRs help set the direction and give clarity, while CFRs provide the fuel to help achieve those goals. A manager's first job is to build a deep and trusting relationship with their team, which is done through providing continuous feedback and recognition. This is an updated way to give feedback and push people to learn and grow.
