	- 1/ Fed & Inflation Fears
	  
	  Russia supplies 1/3 of EU gas.
	  66% of it passes via Ukraine.
	  
	  What's the tie to inflation?
	  Russia cuts off energy to EUðŸ”œprices skyrocket in EUðŸ”œ arbitrage traders spread contagion to US energy markets (where gas is 7.5% of CPI)ðŸ”œhawkish pressure on Fed.

	- Russia & Ukraine also supply 25% of global wheat exports.
	  Meanwhile global warming/droughts add fuel to the fire.
	  
	  Affect on inflation, Fed & stocks:
	  Russia cuts off grain supplyðŸ”œprices skyrocketðŸ”œ Chicago wheat futures now at 9Y highðŸ”œ MORE hawkish pressure on FedðŸ”œstocks tank.

	- 2/ Acceleration of the death of USD
	  
	  US has threatened to "cut off Russia from SWIFT" i.e. the cross-border payment system connecting 11,000 banks from 200+ countries
	  
	  Sounds great but:
	  (a) there's ridiculous fees
	  &
	  (b) it's an excuse to protect USD as the global reserve currency

	- Everything over SWIFT settles in USD, so every member bankâ€”i.e. each of the 200+ countriesâ€”needs to hodl USD.
	  
	  This has granted the US an effectively infinite balance sheet since SWIFT was invented in 1973... it was a fantastic party... until now? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1497647292886749188))
	- Here's how the Ukraine crisis destabilizes USD's reserve status:
	  
	  Russia turns to CIPS (China's alternative)ðŸ”œ things settle over RMB (the new currency to hodl)ðŸ”œ more countries onboard to CIPS and/or create their own SWIFTðŸ”œ the monopoly diesðŸ”œ global demand for USD plunges.

	- 3/ Bitcoin rallies back
	  (here's where Ukraine's crisis may actually help your portfolio)
	  
	  It's pretty scary that a state (e.g. US, Russia) can so "swiftly" cut off ur access to credit and remittance.
	  It's also damn wrong.
	  
	  A viral post awakened the world:

	- The secret's out.
	  
	  Thanks to sanctioning threats, the avg Joe now knows about SWIFT's monopoly over cross-border payments (and their ridonkulous fees! $20-100 per transaction!)
	  
	  I predicted earlier that many more SWIFT competitors will form.
	  
	  The biggest of course is crypto. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1497647298423275529))
