	- 2/50
	  
	  Back in early university, I really wanted to go into the gaming industry, and spent a lot of time abscessed with the study of game dynamics.
	  
	  Both the internal economics and player lifecycles. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667590419472384))
	- 3/50
	  
	  (Later in my career I worked for some gaming companies that had tens of millions of players, but, that industry was surprisingly shitty)
	  
	  One thing this has all lead me to think a lot about recently is "The Metaverse" and where I can expect 'good' games to thrive in it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667591770132485))
	- 4/50
	  
	  The first thing that every game does well is capture a broad spectrum of player types.
	  
	  The earliest model of this was proposed by Richard Bartle (https://t.co/Igvwh9mBRz) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667592952913920))
	- 5/50
	  
	  It basically says that there are four macro player categories along two axis "acting to interacting" and "players to world"
	  
	  That gives you:
	  
	  -The killers
	  -The achievers
	  -The socializers
	  -The explorers

	- 6/50
	  
	  In modern gaming, it's considered a bit oversimplified but it gets the point across.
	  
	  When we think of any great MMO, we can think a lot about the different types of players that filled it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667601131720706))
	- 7/50
	  
	  Maybe you played Tibia, a game that early on was known for being unforgiving and relentless.
	  
	  That fear of loss drove players in a way it felt real and like an accomplishment to level up. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7OgoOFXMAQjym3.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667605720289287))
	- 8/50
	  
	  Meanwhile, others didn't care much for power and focused on collecting rare items. Some collected items of wealth, others collected items of power, and others still collected items that were just no longer easy to find regardless of utility. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7OhShtXIAQhkrb.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667610308943875))
	- 9/50
	  
	  Or perhaps, Eve online was more your speed. You were hungry to make a powerful trade empire, or work your way up in a corporation that felt very much like partaking in a real job (and sometimes paid that way) 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7OhgzfXsAYMiqc.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667616742977537))
	- 10/50
	  
	  Or perhaps you plunged a deep amount of time into leading your WoW guild, working deeply on planning, coordination and inner politics: 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7Ohri6XIAEqYNv.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667621029482496))
	- 11/50
	  
	  There were lots of player categories in each of these games, and that's what gave them appeal.
	  
	  Large coalitions of diverse user types who had *different* ambitions and brought to life a different vertical of the multiverse. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667622594060288))
	- 12/50
	  
	  It didn't matter if you were after the cool paintbrush in Neopets, or trying to max out your mining skill in Runescape. There was something there for you.
	  
	  That's something the Metaverse has yet to capture. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7OrthRXsAIiw65.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667627887284231))
	- 13/50
	  
	  The current Metaverse is either:
	  
	  A) Entirely unstructured:
	  
	  Like cryptokitties, who made the start of something magical and decided to just not actually build any elements of the game and hope others would do it for them. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7Oi6mPXoAAyHR7.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667631557197832))
	- 14/50
	  
	  B) Vaguely Unstructured:
	  
	  Like decentraland, which while it leaves you endless possibilities, it becomes to hard to onboard and guide the average player to join because of the lack of structure/direction (2nd life problem) 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7OjOx9XsAEpI7K.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667635025948675))
	- 15/50
	  
	  C) Overly singularly structured:
	  
	  Like Axie infinity where there is really one or two player archetypes being served currently and most players are pursuing the same goals and put the same economic value on the same items and outcomes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667636607143936))
	- 16/50
	  
	  These variations of structure and purpose shape player behavior and tend to actually result in classic economic and geopolitical problems that countries themselves face.
	  
	  -Population collapse
	  -Economic collapse ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667637810958345))
	- 17/50
	  
	  If you are too unstructured, or too singular structured, then your game will grow rapidly in niche markets, but the growth is tough to sustain.
	  
	  Eventually interest declines and leads to unstable economics and a skewed distribution of power. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667638981120008))
	- 18/50
	  
	  For example, we see this in Machine Zone's "Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire" and all of its clones, where because all players have the same goals and purpose, the concentration of power and wealth as a server ages becomes centralized. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7OkqjlXEAwBmdJ.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667644769345542))
	- 19/50
	  
	  When this happens, no new players can feel competitive in this realm because there is nothing else for them to excel at. 
	  
	  So MZ would just create a new server.
	  
	  Which meant no new players entering the mix so guilds would slowly churn over time until empires were empty. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667647558569984))
	- 20/50
	  
	  On the economics side, we suffer from both fixed asset inflation and infinite item deflation.
	  
	  For example, Stephan Boersoenyi, one of the founders of Tibia, thought a lot about the macroeconomics of his game in his masters thesis: https://t.co/rUnX4o0xxg ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667648762241026))
	- 21/50
	  
	  He knew that it was critical that:
	  
	  -At a certain level (neither before or after) a player should have accumulated enough wealth to acquire a certain tier of equipment.
	  
	  -The value of gold needed sinks to not over inflate. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667650083540994))
	- 22/50
	  
	  This worked really well for a while, as he had mapped out in-depth the entire GDP and labor productivity of each world and the lifecycle of each asset. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7OmGbeWEAEcx4d.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667653707370502))
	- 23/50
	  
	  However, he failed to take into account level inflation. Where without a cap, the average level and therefore power of players over time grew.
	  
	  When Stephan wrote the paper, the highest level players were around level 150, with an average level closer to 60. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667655175331843))
	- 24/50
	  
	  Now the highest level is nearly 2000, with averages in the 500s.
	  
	  This lead to items that are uncapped (like weapon drops, gold and quest rewards) becoming more common. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667656374984704))
	- 25/50
	  
	  Their abundance in turn lead to their price dropping, an them being easier to afford at low levels, making the game easier for new players.
	  
	  On Antica, the oldest world, players could now get a top tier armor set for around $20 equivalence. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7OrjILXEAYHhgO.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419667659088613380))
	- 26/50
	  
	  But, this didn't just impact items.
	  
	  It impacted gold, meaning the buying power of gold rapidly dropped as high level users had a near infinite supply of it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669703493046273))
	- 27/50
	  
	  This greatly impacted the 'fixed' asset of houses in Tibia.
	  
	  Once upon a time, a good house probably cost around 3000 gold pieces a month in rent, and the ownership rights would be auctioned off for a roughly 10x monthly rent. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669704810115077))
	- 28/50
	  
	  Eventually the economy got so out of whack, that bids for houses that cost 1250 gold a month in rent, were being auctioned off for >10M+ gold, sometimes reaching many times higher if they were in a popular location. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7OsmykWUAAsszh.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669708215828487))
	- 29/50
	  
	  This of course, made a major social part of the game unattainable for new players, as the items they had sold for very little gold, and they couldn't keep up with the fortunes of experienced players. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669710044647431))
	- 30/50
	  
	  Eventually CipSoft (the owners of Tibia) had to step in, and drastically increased house rental prices across the board to act as a larger gold sink.
	  
	  But, this has just continued to dampen the ability of new players to partake in the game. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669711458078728))
	- 31/50
	  
	  In game economics, we don't just look at wealth economically, we look at power as well.
	  
	  Putting a hard cap on anything means some of your most committed players churn out, but, failing to do so can create power and wealth inflation that drives new players away. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669712745738243))
	- 32/50
	  
	  And addressing this is a hard problem.
	  
	  Unless the game creators have really well aligned the in-game economic with their companies economics, then games actually thrive on:
	  
	  -New players
	  
	  &
	  
	  -Addicts
	  
	  The extremes of the player base. They don't care about the middle. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7Os7BRXEAY7rgI.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669716176678916))
	- 33/50
	  
	  But it is that middle of the curve that stabilize a game play experience, and usually create the games popularity and spread to attract those users. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669717724405765))
	- 34/50
	  
	  This kind of economic misalignment isn't just theoretical in the Metaverse, in fact we've seen it already.
	  
	  The "Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire" blockchain clone called "League of Kingdoms" had this exact problem. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7OtBxZWEAAcknm.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669721033625601))
	- 35/50
	  
	  They sold land to players, who were supposed to take part in the games governance and economic upside.
	  
	  The land resales were supposed to have a portion of revenue also go to the developer and for that to be sufficient. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669722589810694))
	- 36/50
	  
	  Yet the game over concentrated player power and economics (just like the game it cloned) and was left churning out users because new users didn't want to play on the crowded server.
	  
	  So what did the developers do?
	  
	  They made new servers with more land to sell. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7OtIijXsAYJOzl.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669725764886528))
	- 37/50
	  
	  New players joined in on the new servers, settling on new land, and taking that economic value away from the existing players. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669727379591173))
	- 38/50
	  
	  This is a huge challenge we face in the Metaverse. 
	  
	  Game design is hard.
	  
	  Game economics are even harder.
	  
	  Taking both of those and aligning those incentives and doing so in an unchangeable trustless way, is damn near impossible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669728541483009))
	- 39/50
	  
	  If Metaverse games cannot react easily to change the economics, they likely end up with the challenges Tibia faced of long term inflation, because even with careful planning things can be missed. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669729959161858))
	- 40/50
	  
	  But unless they are contractually restricted to not create more of a rare item, new rare items, or new plots of land, developers will protect their interests. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669731309719556))
	- 41/50
	  
	  This likely means that in the Metaverse we want games that:
	  
	  -Carefully plan their economics ahead of time
	  -Can have governance votes to accept new creation and sink elements into that
	  -Have contractual restrictions of item creation otherwise. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669733771780099))
	- 42/50
	  
	  Will that be enough?
	  
	  No, probably not.
	  
	  We've never seen a game or game economic that hasn't suffered from population, interest and economic collapse.
	  
	  Even the best game economies ever (Eve: Online) have had huge challenges in dealing with inflation. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7OtXyZX0AgiIbN.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669738490376198))
	- 43/50
	  
	  Eventually the value of the game (fun) is outweighed by the economic barriers to partaking in the game in a serious way and things crash in on themselves. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669740482596864))
	- 44/50
	  
	  That's fine if you just want to play ever changing, interoperable games in the metaverse.
	  
	  But, if you want a 'game' to last long term, it likely needs to redefine the parameters of where the game ends within its global space. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669741879414789))
	- 45/50
	  
	  That is to say, I think the first games that are economically viable in the Metaverse will be ones that stop having you play as if you are in a corporation or political entity, and start to bridge those elements into the real world generating actual value. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7Otmn4XIAEOYnZ.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669745029234692))
	- 46/50
	  
	  Whether that is a game where players fight over land that represents staked tokens in other protocols (gathered from in-game sales) in order to capture the economic and governance power of those tokens 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7Ott00XMAkuw50.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669748871221248))
	- 47/50
	  
	  Or games where the tasks you spend energy (and transactions) on, are actually just updating keeper oracles in the background for other projects, and so you earn in-game items for that, and the developer earns revenue. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7Otzk0XoAQnrzR.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669753132630019))
	- 48/50
	  
	  When we create real world economic value by blurring the lines of games, we'll create a larger variety of economic incentives for people to keep playing and growing that part of the metaverse. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669754932088834))
	- 49/50
	  
	  And if there is one thing to take away from this thread, that is is it - variety.
	  
	  Games, political systems and economies succeed on the basis of variety.
	  
	  When I can value an item, an experience, or an asset at a different price than you can, and we're both right. We win.

	- 50/50
	  
	  It is only economic subjectivity that will keep the wheels of progress turning in the Metaverse. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1419669763761049606))
