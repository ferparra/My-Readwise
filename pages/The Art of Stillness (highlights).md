document_note:: This text is an analysis of Pico Iyer's book "The Art of Stillness", which encourages readers to take breaks from their busy lives to sit still and appreciate life. It highlights the importance of taking time for self-care, and how this can help in understanding and empathizing with others. Other key takeaways include the idea that it is impossible to distance oneself from problems that lie within, and that going nowhere can be a way to cut through the noise and find peace. Finally, it recommends TED talks by Mattheiu Ricard, Louie Schwartzberg and Carl Honore, as well as Iyer's own TED talk, which summarize the book.
