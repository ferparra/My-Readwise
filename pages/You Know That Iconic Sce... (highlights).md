	- You know that iconic scene, at the end of The Matrix when Neo suddenly ‚Äúgets it‚Äù and picks bullets out of thin air as if they are cute and curious little things? Been thinking: what‚Äôs the equivalent of ‚Äúseeing the matrix‚Äù for product leaders? 
	  
	  10+ Realizations that come to mind:

	- That you should only do half of what you want (only half the options/tabs, half the offerings, and half the target audience) to compound your chances of true PMF. The builders i admire most are like Bonsai masters, they prune the most beautiful branches to strengthen the trunk. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/scottbelsky/status/1441469886975279109))
	- That you should never outsource your story (PR, and the relationships with journalists that help you stand out and last your career) or any core component of your competitive advantage (design if you're winning on UX, tech if you're winning with the core tech, etc). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/scottbelsky/status/1441469888246259715))
	- That a prototype is worth a hundred meetings, and almost all product meetings that aren‚Äôt grounded with a prototype are a waste of time (or worse). A prototype immediately surfaces gaps in logic or business concerns. It is the fastest way to drive alignment. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/scottbelsky/status/1441469889315622912))
	- That consumer (and prosumer) products ultimately succeed because of how people feel about themselves using them. Ego analytics, surprise+delight, and hooks to appeal to our laziness, vanity, and selfishness in first mile of product experience are the biggest secret in product. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/scottbelsky/status/1441469890607550469))
	- That raising the bar of what your team ships is f*cking hard. It requires culture change, cycles of missed deadlines (which frustrate customers), and career risk to set a NEW BIT for everyone. 
	  
	  ‚ÄúGood enough‚Äù is extremely seductive for any business that seeks to run effectively. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/scottbelsky/status/1441469892050538498))
	- That perceived performance matters more than actual performance (perception is reality when it comes to UX!), and can be achieved as much by designers than engineers. üëÄ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/scottbelsky/status/1441469893166059526))
	- That the best way to review a product experience is to ask 3 questions on EVERY screen: ‚Äúhow did I get here?‚Äù ‚Äúwhat do I do now?‚Äù ‚Äúwhere do I go next?‚Äù ‚Äî these questions will reveal flaws in object model, UX, onboarding, and orientation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/scottbelsky/status/1441469898513735696))
	- That the most powerful (& affordable) driver of product growth is surprise, delight, and intrigue. People don‚Äôt rave about a product doing what they expected, they rave about it doing something they didn‚Äôt expect. (think Tesla‚Äôs games, easter eggs in games‚Ä¶). Prioritize this! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/scottbelsky/status/1441469899650519043))
	- That the best new products ultimately take us back to the way things once were, but w/ more scale and efficiency. They provide a sensation from the past for the modern world (cities, travel, remote working..)
	  
	  To create for the future, mine the parts of the past that we long for. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/scottbelsky/status/1441469900665544708))
	- What other essential realizations cause product leaders to see every challenge and opportunity differently?
