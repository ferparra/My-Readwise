	- Feeling good about the switch from Descript to Resolve. 
	  
	  The workflow is super fun and FAST. A 9 minute, tightly edited video on enums? 90 minutes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk/status/1603408007534198786))

	- The workflow is:
	  
	  Film on OBS. I have a series of scenes there so I can choose which scene (just face, face and code) is best for what I'm trying to communicate. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk/status/1603408623383842818))
	- Split OBS into clips without silence using ffmpeg. I've got this hooked up so it spits it out into Resolve and I can edit the clips manually. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk/status/1603408955564343296))
	- Go through the clips and trim off any silence that ffmpeg missed, and remove any bad takes. This is super nice with the Speed Editor.
	  
	  I also add any bits of flair I want to add here, like zooming-in on clips, or on-screen text etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk/status/1603408957028302848))
	- Upload to YT, do the thumbnail in Figma while it uploads. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk/status/1603409190898237440))
	- @Hawful Not that Descript is bad, it's great! But I wanted to develop my editing skills for fun. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk/status/1603409376844324865))
	- I call it the 'orchidectomy' workflow.
	  
	  In other words, it removes all of the bollocks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk/status/1603410380768051201))
