	- When a week has passed since I've written notes on a bookask me everything I remember about it off the top of my head. Put this into the summary section of my notes as a first draft.
	- When a month has passed since I last touched a note marked as an essay draftgently prompt me to read through it again and write down why I'm stuck.
	- When I state a claimask what evidence I have to back it up and what other notes, books, or academic articles I want to mark as sources for this claim.
	- When I write a note that shares many of the same keywords and phrases as an existing noteshow them to me side by side and ask if I want to combine them.
	- developers and designers of note-taking apps will never be able to create systems that suit the needs of everyone's particular knowledge management workflows
	- And modern NLP systems are a great wall. They can give us just a touch of reflection, perspective, and serendipity when we get stuck in our own heads.
