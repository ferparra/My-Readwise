	- A short story to illustrate why having "Product Owners" sit between Product Managers & Engineers to write user stories, prioritize backlog, and help with delivery rarely makes sense:

	- At ACME inc...
	  
	  PM & PD spend 2 weeks doing discovery. After rounds of interviews and analysis, they finally grasp the problem.
	  
	  They then spend another 2 weeks crafting a good solution.
	  
	  Eng is not involved because "Well, PO will do the handoff." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamAustinYang/status/1600440493623500801))
	- Time for handoff...
	  
	  Now PM/PD have to pass 1 month of knowledge to PO in a 1h meeting.
	  
	  PM thinks: (With this much info, why don't I just talk to Eng directly?)
	  
	  PO thinks: (There's no way I'll understand all this.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamAustinYang/status/1600440496064602113))
	- Time to write user stories...
	  
	  Because PO wasn't part of the discovery, he keeps going back to PM for questions.
	  
	  PM thinks: (Ugh, why don't I just write them myself?)
	  
	  PO feels bad, so he makes some guesses on things he considers minor (but he has no clue if they actually are). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamAustinYang/status/1600440498514120704))
	- Time for dev kickoff...
	  
	  [[ENG]] looks at a list of user stories that read like "As a user, I want to push a button, so the button will be pushed."
	  
	  [[ENG]] rolls her eyes: (I'd rather have a clearly-defined, old-school [[PRD]] than this pseudo-user-centric crap.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamAustinYang/status/1600440501009756161))
	- ENG then asks clarifying questions...
	  
	  PO can't answer most, so he has to ask the PM. The meeting was a waste of time.
	  
	  PO follows up with answers. ENG says the solution is not technically feasible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamAustinYang/status/1600440503509479424))
	- PO relays the info...
	  
	  Now PM & PD have to change to find another solution.
	  
	  After another round of story writing, ENG looks at the new solution and says: "Why would users want this?" (remember they aren't part of the discovery?) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamAustinYang/status/1600440505942228993))
	- This loop repeats 2 more times...
	  
	  Now PM/PD think: "Gosh, the Eng has 0 user & biz understanding!"
	  
	  Eng thinks: "PM/PD didn't think things through!"
	  
	  They've had enough, so they call a meeting to clear things up. Within only 30 min, the trio is able to clarify everything. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamAustinYang/status/1600440508395900929))
	- Turns out, all confusion was caused by a crucial detail that the PO had "guessed" when writing the stories.
	  
	  Well, at least now everything is clear, the PO cheers "Hooray!"
	  
	  Everyone turns to him and asks "SO, WHY ARE YOU HERE AGAIN!?"
	  
	  THE END. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamAustinYang/status/1600440510916702210))
	- I know some will comment "That's not how PO works!"
	  
	  Let's counter their potential counters... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamAustinYang/status/1600440513395449856))
	- "PO do participate in discovery to some degree."
	  
	  Oh, so their time is taken away from delivery?
	  
	  Are you saying one has to be in discovery to do delivery? So why not distribute that work among PM, PD, ENG? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamAustinYang/status/1600440515735875584))
	- "Because they have to focus on one area!"
	  
	  This isn't a production line. You don't maximize outputs by having a strict division of work.
	  
	  Switching context between discovery/delivery has a cost, but it's far smaller than the cost of a messenger who can't pass the right info. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamAustinYang/status/1600440518235676674))
	- "PM focuses on strategy, PO focuses on execution."
	  
	  This is a hollow abstraction that means nothing.
	  
	  When you ask them to define what it looks like in practical terms, they always end up describing the relationship between Product Leaders & IC/junior PMs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamAustinYang/status/1600440520785817600))
	- If you happen to be in such a role â€” don't feel bad.
	  
	  Being able to operate in a sub-optimal setup is worth applauding, and seeing what doesn't work first-hand will help you avoid the traps in the future.
	  
	  Just know that there are probably better places for you to shine. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamAustinYang/status/1600440523348537344))
	- P.S. Blame all the confusion on [[SAFe]] ðŸ™„
	  
	  PO originated as a role PM (occasionally others) plays in [[Scrum]], not a separate job. This blog post by @lissijean explains it the best: https://t.co/aLqPyRaZz2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IamAustinYang/status/1600440525911302146))
