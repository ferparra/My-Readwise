	- In honour of [[Dostoevsky]]'s birthday, here is a thread on what some other artists have to say about him.
	  
	  Note- This is obviously not an exhaustive list, I'll probably keep on adding to it, as and when I find more. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/btwn_dimensions/status/1590777531304931328))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- [[Albert Camus]]' favourite [[Dostoevsky]] novel is Demons, so much so that he has described it as one of those books which changed him. He even adapted Demons for stage, produced by his Nobel Prize money.

	- Camus referred to Dostoevsky very often, one can find his essays (like the Myth of Sisyphus and Rebel) mentioning Dostoevsky's characters like Ivan, Kirillov, Stavrogin etc.

	- [[Kafka]] called [[Dostoevsky]] his blood relative.
	  I always wonder if Kafka's Gregor Samsa was inspired by the underground man when he said the following-

	- There are many literary elements in [[Woody Allen]]'s movies, which definitely includes [[Dostoevsky]]. Love & Death is a must watch for all russian literature fans, specially for this scene alone!
	  
	  He even wrote a parody called 'Notes from the Overfed'. https://t.co/csB0n9PYHT https://t.co/2oWiXtVDNW ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/btwn_dimensions/status/1590777762755022848))
	- Andrei Tarkovsky wanted to make a movie on the life of [[Dostoevsky]], initially he was also planning to adapt The Idiot as a two part TV series.
	  One can find a rhythmic Dostoevskian shade in his movies, specially Nostalghia.

	- [[Charles Bukowski]]'s poems refer Dostoevsky very often. He wrote one, titled Dostoevsky, which truly resonates with you.

	- [[Mario Puzo]] was greatly inspired by The Brothers Karamazov when he wrote The Godfather and here's him being a typical Dostoevsky reader.

	- Though [[Tolstoy]] did not really admire Dostoevsky's literary talent, what he wrote upon [[Dostoevsky]]'s death is really heart-warming, which speaks of the magnificence of these two greatest contemporaries who ever lived.

	- Saving the best reference for the last, it's obviously Mikhail Bulgakov's Master and Margarita. 
	  Dostoevsky is indeed immortal.

	- These are some artistic geniuses we know, there are undoubtedly thousands of people whose lives were changed by his magnificence, myself included.
	  And if I have to add my own thoughts, all I'll say is, [[Dostoevsky]] saved me & in this I am not alone.
	  'Hurrah for Karamazov!'
