	- Proof-based [[interoperability]] is here 🪄.
	  
	  Announcing the first demo [[proof of consensus]] bridge at https://t.co/2ZvFJVpimF. This demo uses a [[zkSNARK]] [[Ethereum]] PoS light client to power a trust-minimized bridge between Goerli and [[Gnosis Chain]].

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ In our previous blog post https://t.co/1Cy4LfcU2X, we outlined a vision for how [[SNARK]]-ed [[proof of consensus]] enables gas-efficient light clients that can directly verify [[consensus]] of a source chain in the [[execution layer]] of a target chain. No multisigs in between ⚰️🗝️🗝️🗝️⚰️.

	- 2/ Today we're announcing our first proof of [[consensus]] implementation for the [[Ethereum]] PoS light client protocol. We have an *end-to-end* live demo https://t.co/2ZvFJVpimF that passes arbitrary messages from Goerli to Gnosis, verified using a on-chain zkSNARK Goerli light client. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SuccinctLabs/status/1587903204750000128))
	- 3/ Our code for circuits and smart contracts is open-source and available here: https://t.co/APHyqVidKB.  Our blog post https://t.co/UYg69ngQgv goes into technical detail on how the Ethereum PoS light client protocol works and our circuits + smart contract design!

	- 4/ Our succinct Ethereum light client can actually be deployed to *any* EVM chain, broadcasting 📢 Ethereum state to the world! If you're interested in accessing Ethereum state in other EVM chains, DM us to collaborate! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SuccinctLabs/status/1587903210802380800))
	- 5/ While our proof of concept is quite exciting and shows the feasibility of proof-based interop, zkSNARK technology is quite new and there is a lot of remaining work to be done in making our system production ready. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SuccinctLabs/status/1587903212274667520))
	- 6/ We are working closely with the Gnosis Chain team and several auditors to audit our circuits and smart contracts. We are also optimizing 🏎️ our proof generation time and smart contract gas costs, so be on the lookout in the next few months for updates.

	- 7/ We are actively hiring! Please DM us or apply at https://t.co/mUWC9BenzH if you're interested in working with us! We are looking for engineers across the stack, from smart contract devs and experienced infrastructure engineers to zkSNARK circuit writers.

	- 8/ Finally big thanks to @GnosisDAO for giving us an extremely generous grant and @0xPARC for giving us an amazing community of friends and collaborators. Thank you @jonathanpwang @yisun @gubsheep @tw_tter @koeppelmann @StefanDGeorge @barinov @k1rill_fedoseev @kobigurk 🙏🙏🙏 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SuccinctLabs/status/1587903217425186816))
