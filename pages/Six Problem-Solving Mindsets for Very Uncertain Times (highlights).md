	- author and economist Caroline Webb to generate more curiosity in team problem solving is to put a question mark behind your initial hypotheses or first-cut answers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmmrkjmsjw45vzv8r4vyjg1b))
	- Recent research shows that we are better at solving problems when we think in terms of odds rather than certainties. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmmsfg6ytrf13kaevtqz1aw2))

	- The secret to developing a dragonfly-eye view is to “anchor outside” rather than inside when faced with problems of uncertainty and opportunity. Take the broader ecosystem as a starting point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmmshehz5s35f38skwfqrq5m))
	- problem solving typically involves designing experiments to reduce key uncertainties, not just relying on existing data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmmsjgx24y13180srdrnj9nb))

	- Statisticians use the abbreviation EVPI—the expected value of perfect information—to show the value of gaining additional information that typically comes from samples and experiments, such as responses to price changes in particular markets. A/B testing is a powerful tool for experimenting with prices, promotions, and other features and is particularly useful for digital marketplaces and consumer goods.

	- Rookie problem solvers show you their analytic process and math to convince you they are clever. Seasoned problem solvers show you differently. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmmsmrpb1ytzamxgcpqdq7tx))
	- Show and tell is how you connect your audience with the problem and then use combinations of logic and persuasion to get action. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmmsnjwhwpz4e6tkg22mc79e))
