	- 7 Reading tips from Austin Kleon (@austinkleon):
	  
	  1) Throw your phone in the ocean. (Or, keep it in airplane mode.)
	  
	  2) Carry a book with you at all times. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlexAndBooks_/status/1281419150389317636))

	- 3) Have another book ready before you finish the one you’re reading. (Make a stack of books to-read or load up your eReader.)
	  
	  4) If you aren’t enjoying a book or learning from it, stop reading it immediately. (Flinging it across the room helps give closure.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlexAndBooks_/status/1281419151748333568))
	- 5) Schedule 1 hour of non-fiction reading during the day. (Commutes, lunch breaks, and any contained period of idle time work well.)
	  
	  6) Go to bed 1 hour early and read fiction. (It will help you sleep.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AlexAndBooks_/status/1281419152822067201))
	- 7) Keep a reading log and share your favorite books with others. (They will send you even more books to read.)
