	- You are (probably) wrong about probability.
	  
	  I'll show you. How many heads you'll get if you toss a fair coin 10 times?
	  
	  If you answered 5, here is why you are wrong.
	  
	  (Below is the 100 HUF coin, if you were wondering.)

	- You might as well try it if you have a coin in front of you.
	  
	  All we can say with 100% certainty is that the number of heads will be between zero and ten.
	  
	  However, that's not all to it.

	- For instance, the probability of landing 8 heads and 2 tails is approximately 4.39%.
	  
	  What does then the 1/2 probability of heads mean?

	- Let's keep tossing the coin.
	  
	  Even though the number of heads and tails varies, it will fluctuate around 1/2, that is, the probability of heads.
	  
	  This is what probability represents.

	- In general, the relative frequency converges to the probability.
	  
	  (The relative frequency is the ratio of occurrences of a given event and the number of experiments.)
	  
	  This is the frequentist interpretation of probability.

	- However, the frequentist interpretation is only one side of the coin, so to speak.
