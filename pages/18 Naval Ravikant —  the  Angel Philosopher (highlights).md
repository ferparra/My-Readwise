	  There like jealousy was a very hard emotion for me to overcome. When I was young, I had a lot of jealousy in me. And by and by, I learned to get rid of it. And it still crops up every now and then. But it's such a poisonous emotion because at the end of the day, you're no better off, you're unhappy, and the person you're jealous of is still successful or good-looking or whatever they are. But the real breakthrough was for me was when I realized at a personal fundamental level, I mean, the problem with these kinds of podcasts is I can give glib answers all day long, but you have to discover your own personal answer because your personal answer is going to be different than mine. It'll speak to you. But the one that I discovered that spoke to me was the day I realized that all these people that I was jealous of, I couldn't just cherry pick and choose a little aspects of their life. I couldn't say, I want his body, I want her money, I want his personality. You have to be that person. Do you want to actually be that person with all of their reactions, their desires, their family, their happiness level, their outlook on life, their self-image? And if you're not willing to do a wholesale, 24, 700 percent swap with who that person is, then there's no point in being jealous. I think that's a great way to look at it. Once I came to that realization, jealousy sort of straighted away because I don't want to be anybody else. I'm perfectly happy being me. And by the way, even that is under my control to be happy being me. It's just there's no social rewards for it.
