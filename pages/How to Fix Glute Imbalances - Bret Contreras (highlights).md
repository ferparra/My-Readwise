	- Research shows that the glutes can become inhibited with just about any lower body or spinal injury. How many of you readers have stubbed your toe? This inhibits the glutes. How many of you have sprained an ankle? Glute inhibition. Hurt your knee or your hip? Pulled a groin or hammy? Fell on your tailbone? Experienced sciatica? Tweaked your low back? All of these injuries decrease glute activation. Is this a bad thing?
	- The problem is that the glutes donâ€™t necessarily turn back on automatically. They must be reactivated, restrengthened, and recoordinated back into every day movement and activity.
	- This is why you see pelvises dropping to the side and knees collapsing inward during gait, backs rounding over during lifting tasks, and an over-reliance on the hamstrings for hip extension.
	- Utilize resistance bands placed around the feet, ankles, or knees to perform squats, bridges, and various walking movements
	- Perform extra volume for the weaker leg when busting out single leg and core stability work such as lunges, single leg RDLs, side planks and Pallof presses, and
	- Perform SMR and flexibility work if you have hip flexibility imbalances.
