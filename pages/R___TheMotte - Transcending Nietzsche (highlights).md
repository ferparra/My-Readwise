	- Nietzschean morality.  If I were to sum up this term in one 21st-century sentence, I would say it's to play the games you're programmed to play to the best of your ability without weird arbitrary shame.  Do you feel like life is a big status game?  Then try to win.  Do you feel competitive toward somebody?  Then compete.  Do you feel the need to impress a certain person?  Then put all your mind, body, and heart into impressing that person.  Trust your instincts and don't second-guess yourself.  Your will and your intellect should be at the service of your instincts.
	- now hear the fiery gospel of Zarathustra and liberate yourself, if you dare accept the dangers inherent in living a full life!
	- Nietzsche's world was a world of a stifling, arbitrary sort of political correctness called "morality", and the few strong and lucky enough to liberate their consciences from its clutch.
	- he rejected anything resembling dualism and even explicitly embraced epiphemenalism
	- If we are loving our neighbor as we love ourselves, we appreciate not only tender things in them but also their thrill of competition and joy in victory.
	- intergrating his celebration of body and power into a moral framework that follows the two golden rules of loving God (or, for an atheist, unconditional honesty with self, which might be the most important part) and loving those close to you as you love yourself (which can now mean kicking their ass).
