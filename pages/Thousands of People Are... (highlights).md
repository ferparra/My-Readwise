	- Thousands of people are earning a living playing Axie Infinity, a crypto game in which you breed & battle cartoonish creatures called Axies.
	  
	  But what we don't talk about enough is how Axie's economy actually works ðŸ‘‡

		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ Axieâ€™s economy has two tokensâ€”two in-game currencies that underpin the Axie economy. 
	  
	  The two tokens are called Axie Infinity Shards (AXS) and Small Love Potion (SLP). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rex_woodbury/status/1451690535228362755))
	- 2/ Axie Infinity Shards (AXS) is Axieâ€™s *governance* token. 
	  
	  In some ways, you can think of AXS like voter registration rights, equipping you to be a "citizen" of the Axie Infinity world. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rex_woodbury/status/1451690536406896645))
	- 3/ Small Love Potion (SLP) is the currency that fuels Axie's economy. 
	  
	  SLP is earned by playing the gameâ€”for example, by winning battles with your Axieâ€”and SLP is spent through the breeding of Axies.

	- 4/ SLP is an uncapped utility token, which is a fancy way of saying that supply ebbs and flows. 
	  
	  SLP supply typically hovers around 500 million, but will be higher if more SLP is being earned than burned, and vice versa. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rex_woodbury/status/1451690542744555530))
	- 5/ You need three Axiesâ€”three creaturesâ€”to play the game. 
	  
	  You spend money to buy your Axies (or @YieldGuild lends you Axies so you can start playing, since each Axie currently costs ~$200), and then you play either Adventure Mode or Arena Mode.
	  
	  If you win, youâ€™re awarded SLP.

	- 6/ You can convert your SLP into ETH and then into dollars. Thatâ€™s how you make real-world money playing the game.
	  
	  Thousands of people (about 40% in the Philippines) are earning a living this way. Here, a grandmother plays Axie with her grandson watching.

	- 7/ Axieâ€™s inflection point came on April 28th, when the game switched from the Ethereum blockchain to the Ronin sidechain. 
	  
	  Before the switch, players had to pay high transaction fees on Ethereum, which limited who could afford to play. Ronin eliminated those fees. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rex_woodbury/status/1451690553007960071))
	- 8/ Growth exploded. 
	  
	  In late April, Axie was doing $100K per day in revenue. Six weeks later, Axie was doing $18 million per day in revenue, a 180x increase.

	- 9/ Along with switching to Ronin, Axie integrated @RampNetwork, a fiat-to-crypto on-rampâ€”now people could buy ETH using their credit card.
	  
	  This opened the floodgates to who could buy Axies on the marketplace and start playing the game.
	  
	  Axie is now on track for $1B+ this year.

	- 10/ Daily active users surged from 38,000 in April to 250,000 in June to nearly 2,000,000 today, a ~5,000% increase.
	  
	  Members of Axieâ€™s Discord server have grown from 50K in April to 800K today. 
	  
	  Revenue leapt from ~$10M in June to ~$200M in July and ~$370M in August. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rex_woodbury/status/1451690561090383873))
	- 11/ Like our real-world economy, Axie's economy is fragile.
	  
	  Overbreeding could dilute the value of Axies & create a glut of supply, leading to less value-earning potential for new players & slowing player demand.
	  
	  It's incredible that a digital economy has these properties. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rex_woodbury/status/1451690562243862531))
	- 12/ What's fascinating (and underappreciated) about Axie is how deceptively *complex* its economy is. 
	  
	  On the surface, Axie seems like a fun game full of cartoonish creatures. But underneath, it's a vibrant and robust world that is reimagining how we interact and earn online.
