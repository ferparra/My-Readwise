	- Give up the Paranoia
	  
	  The open path is a matter of working purely with what is, of giving up altogether the fear that something may not work, that something may end in failure. One has to give up the paranoia that one might not fit into situations, that one might be rejected. One purely deals with life as it is. (OD)
	- No Watcher
	  
	  Nobody is being aware of anything, but itself. The razor blade cuts itself. The sun shines by itself. Fire burns by itself. Water flows by itself. Nobody watches.
	- The bodhisattva vow acknowledges confusion and chaos—aggression, passion, frustration, frivolousness—as part of the path. The path is like a busy, broad highway, complete with roadblocks, accidents, construction work, and police. It is quite terrifying. Nevertheless it is majestic, it is the great path. “From today onward until the attainment of enlightenment I am willing to live with my chaos and confusion as well as with that of all other sentient beings. I am willing to share our mutual confusion.” So no one is playing a one-upmanship game. The bodhisattva is a very humble pilgrim who works in the soil of samsara to dig out the jewel embedded in it.
	- You should appreciate yourself, respect yourself, and let go of doubt and embarrassment so that you can proclaim goodness and basic sanity for the benefit of others
	- When you contact the energy of Windhorse, you can naturally let go of worrying about your own state of mind and you begin to think of others. If you are unable to let go of your selfishness, you might freeze Windhorse into ice.
	- We might feel inadequate, but nevertheless we pretend we can do it. We push ourselves into the situation. We are uncertain whether we are able to tread this path or not, but we still decide to do it.
	- When we accept uncertainty as the working base, then we begin to discover that we do not exist. We can experience and appreciate the ambiguity as the source of confusion as well as the source of humor.
	- There are times to cultivate and create, when you nurture your world and give birth to new ideas and ventures.
	  
	  There are times of flourishing and abundance, when life feels in full bloom, energized and expanding.
	  
	  And there are times of fruition, when things come to an end. They have reached their climax and must be harvested before they begin to fade.
	  
	  And finally of course, there are times that are cold, and cutting and empty, times when the spring of new beginnings seems like a distant dream.
	  
	  Those rhythms in life are natural events. They weave into one another as day follows night, bringing, not messages of hope and fear, but messages of how things are. (OD)
	- If you have awareness in whatever you do, you always have a sense of basic decency. You do not cheat. You do not do things just because they are traditional, and you don’t just do something this year simply because you did it last year. You always try to practice your discipline as genuinely and honestly as possible—to the point where the honesty and genuineness begin to hurt.

	- The bad news is you’re falling through the air, nothing to hang on to, no parachute. The good news is, there’s no ground.
