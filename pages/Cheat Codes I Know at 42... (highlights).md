		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1. Use workouts to gain muscle, diet to burn fat and cardio to improve your overall health & longevity.
	  
	  2. Eat a high protein diet comprised of whole foods for the best body composition.
	  
	  3. When lifting weights use your mind to muscle connection to increase muscle contraction. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1593967887424765957))
	- 4. Upon waking drink water before coffee.
	  
	  5. Delay coffee 1-2 hours upon waking. This lets cortisol clear out adenosine, which can lead to sustained energy into the afternoon.
	  
	  6. Use your nose for smelling & breathing. Use your mouth for talking, tasting & eating. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1593967889870102532))
	- 7. Mouth breathing disrupts sleep, ruins oral health & can cause sleep apnea. Mouth taping at night helped me solve this.
	  
	  8. Mouthwash is the biggest dental scam. Kills your oral microbiota. Avoid.
	  
	  9. Avoid fluoride in your toothpaste. Use ones that have hydroxyapatite. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1593967893536198657))
	- 10. Sleep at the same times every day. Align your body with the rising & setting of the sun.
	  
	  11. The 321 method for better sleep. No eating 3 hours before bed. No liquids 2 hours before. No screens 1 hour before.
	  
	  12. If you look at screens at night wear bluelight blockers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1593967896073576452))
	- 13. You sleep for 1/3 of your entire life. Learn how to optimize it and make it make it as awesome as possible.
	  
	  14. Memory is fallible. When you have a good idea write it down immediately.
	  
	  15. Your best ideas come in the shower, walking or in the gym. Keep a notepad ready. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1593967898850115585))
	- 16. Peel a boiled egg by rolling it around your plate for awhile until all the shells are cracked. This makes it easy to remove the complete shell in one shot.
	  
	  17. Close the toilet bowl when flushing to avoid particles of filth sprouting up into your bathroom atmosphere. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1593967901031161857))
	- 18. The more you criticizes others the more you criticize yourself. If you want to judge yourself less judge others less.
	  
	  19. Stay away from people who always complain. They are energy vampires.
	  
	  20. Stay away from people who gossip. They are most likely gossiping about you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1593967903203811334))
	- 21. Learn a martial art to increase discipline, confidence & release stress.
	  
	  22. Seek rejection daily. This numbs you to the feeling. Also, you only get what you ask for.
	  
	  23. Take complete ownership for every result in your life. The only constant in every result is you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1593967905451827200))
	- 24. When someone is walking in your path look at their shoulder closest to you. 9 times out of 10 they will move out of the way.
	  
	  25. Be in rooms where you're the dumbest person. Workout at gyms where you're the least fit person. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1593967908043907072))
	- 26. When you feel an emotion don't numb it. It'll only make it feel worse later. Feel it fully then let it go. Emotion is energy. We must let it pass.
	  
	  27. You can tell a lot about someones character by how they treat service staff. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1593967910187372549))

	  29. When someone shows you their true colours believe them.
	  
	  30. A few months a year go monk mode. Eliminate all distractions & vices and use that energy to build your health & business. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1593967912313921537))
	- 31. Who you choose as a partner will determine your level of peace, wealth & happiness.

	- 34. Your best decisions come from stillness. Stillness is amplified in nature & meditation.
	  
	  35. You can only get stronger when you face problems in life. Embrace the fucking struggle.
	  
	  36. Show up up, do the work & seek ways to grow. Do this every day & watch what happens. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1593967916743294978))
	- 37. Trust people who say "I don't know" more than the people who have all the answers.
	  
	  38. Seek feedback from those in the arena. Not from the ones who are boo'ing from the cheap seats.
	  
	  39. No one cares. Work harder. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FitFounder/status/1593967919070748672))
	- 40. Instead of giving your kids what you wish you had teach them things you wish you knew.
	  
	  41. Keep a small circle. It's better to go narrow & deep than wide & shallow.
