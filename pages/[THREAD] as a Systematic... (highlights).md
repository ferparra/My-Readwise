	- [THREAD] As a systematic public market investor, #VentureCapital was an asset class that felt opaque to me based on only my limited exposure of #AngelInvesting & my friends in the industry. In this article, I set the context for Unpacking Alpha in Venture Capital.

	- 1.) It is a challenging asset class to digest & I am sure a majority of large institutional pools of capital would struggle to list more than a handful of brand name VC firms or investors. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmadmbutt/status/1062086161349382144))
	- 2.) That said, top decile returns in VC are extremely impressive so I decided to take a deeper look with a view to create an ecology map & building an institutional footprint from first principles. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmadmbutt/status/1062086821335760898))
	- 3.) The historical narrative for prospective investors into this asset class has been one that believes the only way to access these returns is to invest in brand name funds. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmadmbutt/status/1062086955431849984))
	- 4.) Such funds are capacity constrained & are usually closed to new #LPs. As a counter narrative, there are continually new funds entering the market & capturing value. This presents a problem. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmadmbutt/status/1062086997857185793))
	- 5.) My base hypothesis was that as a pool of capital, an allocation to VC can deliver uncorrelated, strong returns & that there's an informational benefit to having a lens into the future technologies that will continue to displace operations, impair assets, & disrupt incumbents.

	- 6.) Before I dive in, I do want to thank all the friends that have helped me understand this asset class better. We consider #VentureCapital to be an incredibly collaborative community and it has been a pleasure to learn more deeply. https://t.co/z4VPHTkDxZ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmadmbutt/status/1062089918632116224))
	- 7.) Whilst not wanting to spoil the suspense of what follows in the series, I thought it would be helpful to lay out my core conclusions on venture capital. Here goes: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmadmbutt/status/1062093048581185536))
	- 8.)
	  
	  •VC is a cottage industry but done scrupulously & systematically it can deliver strong, uncorrelated returns. #Alpha generation is very poorly attributed.
	  
	  •Dollars should be focused into capacity constrained strategies that attack the early stages. VC doesn’t scale. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmadmbutt/status/1062094418046541824))
	- 9.)
	  
	  • I see no obvious warning signs that this is a poor time to enter the asset class. Technology-led innovation is pervasive & cumulative. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmadmbutt/status/1062094764600971266))
	- 10.)
	  
	  • Whilst #SiliconValley has undoubtedly been the epicentre of technology #innovation, other hubs of ideation, innovation & #global problem solving are developing fast. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmadmbutt/status/1062094994322939904))
	- 11.)
	  
	  • VC is a human capital business, driven by prescient #GPs & outlier #founders. There is limited evidence to support long-term consistent firm-level performance, in fact persistence of performance is declining. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmadmbutt/status/1062095219120918532))
	- 12.)
	  
	  • Investing with more metrics = less alpha. The best investors are comfortable investing at the edges, but do so on the basis of a scientific & rigorous process that appreciate the risk. A quick summary of rigorous methodology is inspired by  P. Tetlock’s #Superforecasting ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmadmbutt/status/1062095602744475648))
	- 13.)
	  
	  • The best #EarlyStage investors are foxes — they are curious #polymaths, with broad peripheral vision. #LPs should test for & allocate to investors with the optimal attributes versus making their own editorial about where the next tech wave will come from. https://t.co/aFa9e72fSh ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmadmbutt/status/1062097695593119745))
	- 14.)
	  
	  • Technology #KPIs have evolved but I believe most #PublicMarket investors still don’t understand the pervasiveness of technology. Every listed asset is potentially impaired. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmadmbutt/status/1062097923134156800))
	- 15.)
	  
	  • #LPs have not challenged their #GPs to innovate nor gone deeper on GP level #data. I consider the industry must mature faster & both sides must do better. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmadmbutt/status/1062098394297126912))
	- 16.)
	  
	  • Most early stage investors waste the informational alpha generated — it provides a lens into what will work in the future but in nearly every scenario tells you what isn’t working within incumbents. Cross-pollinate this info to unlock more alpha in public #portfolios. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmadmbutt/status/1062098733431771136))
	- 17.) I plan to release another four chapters in this series that chronicle my learnings about this asset class. I encourage feedback & constructive criticism from #entrepreneurs, #investors & other interested parties.
