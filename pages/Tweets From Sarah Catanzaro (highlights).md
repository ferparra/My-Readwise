	- If you're going to teach your business stakeholders SQL, you ought to also teach them about confounding, bias, and outliers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sarahcat21/status/1394329777557839873))
	- As a board member, I find that data does not necessarily reveal the answers (it’s not our job to tell people what to do anyway), but rather ask relevant/important questions. When I can’t trust the data, I’m unlikely to ask good questions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sarahcat21/status/1402278616759681037))
	- Analytics engineers should not focus only on building data models, but also on automating processes to "increase the efficiency and quality of analytics." Enjoyed reading about why Nubank promotes code reuse among AE.

	- Should product or data own the experimentation platform? Vaguely worded question to invite a range of responses. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sarahcat21/status/1451200142342717440))
	- I'm fascinated by the pattern wherein data practitioners unite on a common theme (e.g. data mesh, semantic layer, data contracts), which they (at least occasionally) spend more time debating than implementing. I don't observe this in other developer communities. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sarahcat21/status/1575537847607533568))
