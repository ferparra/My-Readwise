	- perfectionist stakes his identity on achieving his outcomes,
	  meaning his self-worth depends on realizing them
	- Perfectionism endures because it has its merits, and we must see these clearly
	  as well. It establishes a high standard and feeds on a source of intense
	  energy, i.e. the fear of losing our identity and self-worth. So it is no
	  surprise that some of the world's luminaries have made contracts with it.
	- Our attention shifts from
	   outcomes to process.
	- excellence focuses on
	   better outcomes. Any real situation can always be improved. Since there is
	   no perfect outcome, perfection is impossible.
	- Cognitive-behavioral therapy, which trains the mind to challenge distorted
	  thoughts related to perfectionism (e.g. "I'm a failure" → "I might fail,
	  but I'm successful in other ways").
	- Exposure and response prevention, which trains the mind to tolerate and
	  reduce mental distress by repeatedly facing the distressing thought (e.g.
	  "I'm going to fail" → "Yes, maybe I will.").
	- Mindfulness meditation, which trains the mind to engage with thoughts
	  non-reactively (e.g. "I'm going to fail" → "The thought of failure is
	  arising").
