	- Process: slowing down, stepping back, noticing what others miss, challenging assumptions (including your own), gaining a deeper understanding of the situation or problem at hand, question the questions you’re asking, taking ownership of a particular question and trying to shift perspective in order to see your own life – and the problems, opportunities and challenges worth tackling – more clearly
	- Why – helps you question the status quo and see potential new possibilities; backwards steps
	- What If – helps you see things other than they currently are; leaps of imagination
	- How – helps you take your question and make it actionable; action, failure, iteration
	- Tends to be inverse relationship between expertise and good questions. Most breakthrough innovations come from “outside the field”
	- Must have an awareness of what we don’t know in order to ask great questions
	- Innovative questioning – confronting, formulating and framing the initial question that articulates the challenge at hand and trying to get some understanding of the context
	- Evidence – how do we know what’s true or false? What evidence counts?
	  Viewpoint – how might this look if we stepped into other shoes, or looked at it from a different direction?
	  Connection – is there a pattern? Have we ween something like this before?
	  Conjecture – what if it were different?
	  Relevance – why does this matter?
	  Approach questions, situations, answers with skepticism and empathy
