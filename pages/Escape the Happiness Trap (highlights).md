	- The [[Happiness]] Trap
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* High levels of experiential avoidance are directly correlated with increased risk of depression, anxiety disorders, addiction, and other mental health issues., * The idea of happiness being about feeling good is a relatively new concept, and was only popularized in the last hundred years. Prior to this, happiness was more about doing good.)

	  Experiential avoidance is the ongoing attempt to avoid or get rid of unwanted thoughts, feelings, emotions, and memories, all of that uncomfortable stuff that shows up inside us that we don't like. Experiential avoidance is normal, we're all, I don't know anybody who just loves having painful thoughts and feelings. But what happens is high levels of experiential avoidance, where people are really kind of trying very, very hard to avoid and get rid of unwanted thoughts and feelings. Well high levels of this actually directly correlate with your risk of depression, anxiety disorders, addiction, and many other mental health issues. So if you're trying very, very hard to control your emotions, to avoid or get rid of the unpleasant ones and create and cling to the pleasant ones, it's going to create a lot of problems for you. You know, in my book, The Happiness Trap, it's cool to happen this trap because popular notions of happiness create this trap that actually pull you into this vicious cycle of avoidance that makes life worse. There's a very different way of looking at happiness, which doesn't come naturally to most people. The kind of concepts of happiness I've just been talking about is really only become popular in the last hundred years, this idea that it's about feeling good. But if we go back over the centuries for most of recorded history, happiness has not been about feeling good. It's been about doing good.

	- How to Deal with Difficult Emotions
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Pop psychology strategies, such as distraction techniques and suppression of emotions, can be effective in the short term, but they often have a rebound effect in the long term., * Pop psychology strategies are less effective when the emotional pain is intense.)

	  Well, I would say probably again that the two most common would be distraction techniques. I mean, these are so popular, some unpleasant thoughts and feelings show up. And so you go to your happy place or you think of something positive or you snap an elastic band around your wrist and tell those thoughts and feelings to go away. And one of the big problems with distraction strategies is there's a sort of rebound effect. So they do work in the short term, for example, snapping the elastic band and telling negative thoughts to go away. Actually in the short term, they do. But what the research shows very clearly is that in the long term, they rebound with greater and greater frequency and intensity. It's the same with kind of squashing painful emotions down, suppressing our emotions. In the short term, we can actually do it. But again, in the long term, lots of research to show there's a rebound effect where the emotions come back with greater frequency and intensity. Many, many pop psychology strategies rely very heavily on thinking techniques. It might kind of challenge your negative thoughts or try to replace them with positive affirmations. And the thing with thinking techniques is they work quite well a lot of the time if your emotional pain is mild, if you're just a little bit sad or a little bit angry or a little bit anxious or a little bit guilty, you can usually think your way out of it quite effectively with these pop psychology strategies. But the more intense your emotional pain and the greater the difficulty you're facing in your life, the less effective those techniques become. Yeah, take the example of someone you love is dying or has just died. There's no positive thinking strategy that's going to enable you to think away your painful feelings. You don't have intense feelings of sadness or anger or maybe anxiety. ([Time 0:08:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7bcd6af4-657c-4170-9f80-26d2a7acfbdc))
	- Cognitive Diffusion: How Thoughts Diffuse Through Our Minds
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Cognitive diffusion is a technique that can be used to reduce the distance between thoughts., * It is common for viewers to experience cognitive fusion when trying this technique.)

	  So I hope you viewers did that, Brett, did you have a go at it?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I did have a go at it. Yes.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  And what kind of happened for you?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I just, it reduced the, there's like a distance put into it. Like the phrase is like, I just noticed myself becoming more distant from that initial thought, basically. Yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So yeah, that's the common experience. If any viewer didn't have that experience, I just encourage you to try it again, pick a different thought perhaps and try it again. But that's a very simple, the technical name for what we're doing there. I think you mentioned it earlier is cognitive diffusion. So cognitive fusion means we get hooked by our thoughts. They dominate us. They have huge power over us. ([Time 0:31:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f84bc123-023b-41f9-85f4-890e85449f60))
