	- Re: SBF / FTX
	  
	  Most criminals are not sociopaths. In fact, most have a conventional sense of right and wrong.
	  
	  Crime is instead largely about situational psychology, and the availability of convenient excuses to "neutralize" the force of prevailing norms.

	- Criminologists once thought that crime arose from deviant subcultures with inverted moral values. Yet try stealing from a gang member and see if they like it!
	  
	  In reality, crime tends to arise in social settings that provide for self-serving excuses to bypass the usual norm.

	- I didn't steal that crypto from you. I only "borrowed" it.
	  
	  I had to run a Ponzi scheme; everyone else was doing it.
	  
	  The situation was caused by forces outside my control.
	  
	  etc. etc.
	  
	  Such excuses arise again and again in both the white collar and street crime setting.

	- One of dangers of normative theories like utilitarianism / consequentialism is that they supply a rich toolkit for excusing violations of common sense morality.
	  
	  Take Peter Singer's defense of Noble Lies:

	- Peter Singer thinks it's morally correct to secretly kill a patient undergoing brain surgery if it means you can harvest their organs and save more lives, but understands the dangers of endorsing that view openly, and so recommends that utilitarians engage in esoteric denial.

	- If SBF was presented with a button with a 49% of destroying earth and a 51% chance of creating a 2nd earth, he'd probably push it.
	  
	  (Note that most "long-termist" societies orient around *not* pushing such buttons)

	- So as you reconstruct SBF's thought process, realize he isn't a bad guy at heart. Rather, he likely genuinely thought he was doing a greater good, at least according to his Fermi estimate.

	- In "On the Question of Motive,"  Schopenhauer imagines two young men, Caius and Titus, who both lose their love to more favored rivals. Both resolve to kill their rival, â€œbut when they come to actually prepare for the murder, each of them, after an inward struggle, draws back." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hamandcheese/status/1590849460925612032))
	- Caius and Titus then give their reasons.
	  
	  Caius appeals to rationalist moral theories. Killing his rival would not be "a rule universally valid for all possible rational beings," for example.

	- Titus is completely unfamiliar with modern moral philosophy. He hasn't even heard of the trolley problem, let alone the Saint Petersburg Paradox.
	  
	  Instead, as he went to murder his rival, he was gripped with an innate sense of sorrow and compassion that overpowered him.

	- Paraphrasing Schopenhauer, the question is: Who would you rather be the custodian of your life savings? Caius and Titus? I know how I'd answer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hamandcheese/status/1590851119584268289))
