	- For any difficult or high-impact product decision, we typically face a plethora of questions about what tradeoffs to make, what risks to take, how things might play out in practice, how this decision impacts our users, strategy, goals,...
	  
	  Enter a thinking tool: Eigenquestions
	  üëáüèæ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1293973551167373312))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- For high-stakes product decisions, we need to step back & seek the Eigenquestion (creator: @shishirmehrotra).
	  
	  The Eigenquestion is the question, which, if answered, provides the basis for answering most other substantial questions associated with this decision. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1293973551955861510))
	- An Eigenquestion example for Netflix
	  
	  TVOD=Transactional Video On Demand
	  SVOD=Subscription VOD
	  
	  Problem:
	  Given catalog(TVOD) >> catalog(SVOD), should we offer TVOD content? 
	  
	  A super-complex decision!
	  
	  The Eigenquestion:
	  Do we care more about catalog size or consumption friction? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1293973552840888320))
	- One reason that Eigenquestions work so well is that they force us to better align our decision with our vision & strategy. A great reminder. So yes, "our catalog could be larger if we offered individually paid content to our members", but is that aligned with our vision & brand?

	- Too often, decision-making starts with a background on metrics/feedback/etc, is followed by a set of options (clearly 3 is best :) ), & lastly it presents the recommended option. The group then litigates the fine details of the presented information to try & arrive at a decision. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1293973554623438848))
	- Since I first learned about Eigenquestions a few years ago, I now spend about ¬Ω the time making sure we have the right question for the decision. And then the remaining ¬Ω can be allocated to a discussion of the pros/cons of the options
	  
	  It feels slow, but it‚Äôs faster (and better) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1293973555479113728))
	- Combine WAYRTTD & Eigenquestions, apply them judiciously, and you & your team will be making significantly better product decisions that are more likely to stick.
