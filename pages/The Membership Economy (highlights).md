document_note:: The Membership Economy is a book by Blas Moros which discusses the shift from ownership to membership as digital manufacturing becomes more prevalent, and the impact it will have on society. It outlines strategies to build the right organization, acquire customers, onboard members, and price models to create successful businesses that are centered around the customer. It also discusses community building and loyalty programs, and how small companies can leverage their focus, exclusivity, and recognition. Finally, it emphasizes the importance of the forever transaction in creating strong customer relationships.

	- Strategies to successfully align with membership economies
	  
	  1.  **Build the right organization** – culture and attitude are central to making the customer the core
	  2.  **Build a bottoms up acquisition funnel** – with a forever transaction, retention is far more important than acquisition. Start at the bottom (with the core value and the ideal members that this would resonate with), and then build up to the top of the funnel
	  3.  **Onboard members for success and super users** – first few days are key to the member experience and their long-term engagement. Think about first steps, roadmaps, how they should get started. **There are 3 key steps – remove friction, add immediate value, reward behavior and actions you want to incentivize. In other words, make it easy, make it personal, get them involved**
	  4.  **Model pricing for simplicity and flexibility** – risk is too much complexity too early in the relationship. Value needs to be clear, transparent, differentiated. Cadence needs to be tested as well and see if monthly, annual, consumption based, etc makes the most sense. Some pricing strategies: subscriptions (with or without tiers, typically 3 tiers), ancillary products (swag, things that will make the membership more valuable), partnership streams, aggregated analytics, advertising, free products and service offerings. Beware discounts, pricing too low or too high at the beginning,
	  5.  **Incorporate “free” as a tactic, not a strategy** – free is powerful but only if it supports the overall business model. Use it to build awareness and increase size of funnel, build a large community that can aid paying members
	  6.  **Use the right technology and track the right data** – social / marketing automation, CRM, engagement, community, customer success, loyalty, billing.
	  7.  **Retain members but know when to let them go** – loyalty is vital but the wrong customer will be very expensive ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1bf36m7qy8p3xjbqs70r6y))
		- **Note**: Successfully aligning with membership economies requires building the right organization with a customer-centric culture, creating a bottoms-up acquisition funnel with retention as the focus, onboarding members to remove friction and add value, pricing for simplicity and flexibility, incorporating free as a tactic and not a strategy, using the right technology and tracking the right data, and retaining members but knowing when to let them go.
