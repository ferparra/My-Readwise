	- Required reading for anybody using PINNs:

	  I think PINNs are an exciting idea but many use cases are perhaps better suited to learned NN prediction (for unresolved scales), or just standard numerical integrators (resolved scales).

	- I think the best application of PINNs is probably sparse or weird boundary problems â€“ when there are no numerical integrators available.
	  This is similar in many ways to the extremely successful application of implicit neural representations in NeRF models.
