	- So many - mostly negative - comments on Heroku’s decision to discontinue the free tiers.
	  
	  On one end, I get the frustration. On the other, have we grown to expect free stuff? When it’s free, you are either the product (see: Facebook, Twitter), or are part of an upsell funnel. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1563121883016761344))

	- In a business sense, any loss-making activity is there because it still generates some business returns. Aka making a loss on the free tier is made up by those converting from the free tier to paying ones.
	  
	  But if free costs more than what it brings… then this can happen. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1563122338308435970))
	- The longer I’m in tech, the more suspicious I am with free offerings, because such offerings are rarely sustainable over years.
	  
	  I’d much rather pay for a supplier knowing they will stay in business & support my product. It’s hard enough for paid infra startups to stay alive… ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1563123039356977152))
	- The sooner you realize that free tiers are for advertising/sales/upselling and they will be retired when they stop being profitable, the better off you'll be.
	  
	  E.g. @Render (one I use) also has free tiers. Expect those to one day likely to also either disappear or change. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1563124891913973762))
	- I'd also argue that a company ending free support is a good learning opportunity:
	  
	  1. If your project made money: start paying!
	  
	  2. If it did not: either migrate to another free provider (eg @Railway, @Render, @flydotio) or shut it down. Both are good learnings experience-wise! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1563126087831302144))
