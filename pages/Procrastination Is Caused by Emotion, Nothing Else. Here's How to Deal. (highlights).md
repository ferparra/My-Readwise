	- There is actually science to back up the link between emotions and procrastination! A big part of procrastination is related to shame and fear, but not just because you think something will be hard when it's not. Sometimes things are actually hard, and you feel like you'll disappoint the people who expect you to do EVERYTHING perfectly... so you put it off until the last minute. At least if it sucks you can say, "well, I did it in an hour so it's not bad." Then, it's not about your ability to do the thing, but your ability to manage your time. The big thing to realize is that not everything you do has to be perfect. Start your project, work on the outline, and if you don't like the first draft, you'll have time to redo it. Just let go of perfection. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs1wv8sdfv68ckggypskhe97))
