	- Hardly any customer adopts it https://t.co/78aC5l9CBP ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033615029538828))
	- At the next product review:
	  
	  PM directs attention towards positives:
	  ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what we‚Äôve learnt‚Äù
	  
	  Learnings usually include:
	  ‚ÄúOur MVP isn‚Äôt sufficient. We need to make it easier to implement & adopt. We need features X, Y, Z‚Äù https://t.co/H1iGLPDz6U ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033620448579589))

	- At next product review:
	  Sales & Marketing start getting implicated
	  
	  PM says:
	  ‚ÄúWe know from talking to customers that we have the right product. We just need to improve our Go-To-Market strategy.‚Äù https://t.co/1vpOgz0PY1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033642636402688))
	- Executives & the PM are ‚Äúpot-committed‚Äù at this point.
	  
	  Ideas about how to better sell the product are discussed: reduce prices, cross-sell, bundle, email campaigns, re-organize the Sales team, etc.
	  
	  Changes are made. https://t.co/FGexmnoJns ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033646826561544))
	- https://t.co/FsWY30Js4o ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033655106113537))
	- Still no growthüòü https://t.co/ZIddFOqgcL ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033659333959681))
	- By this time, original PM has left the team
	  
	  A new PM joins. Starts with a ‚Äúcustomer listening tour‚Äù in first 90 days
	  
	  Identifies some additional issues
	  
	  Presents new findings & recommendations to the executive team
	  
	  Gets mandate to execute on revised plan https://t.co/gmzZaLJCSv ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033664266465280))
	- Now what?
	  
	  Go back a few tweets
	  
	  Repeat the steps a couple more times https://t.co/vzrnB57hAJ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033669639331845))
	- More things shipped
	  
	  Still no growth
	  
	  And then... https://t.co/IeRu3uqET4 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033680586461184))
	- Ultimately:
	  
	  Executive team decides to sunset the product
	  
	  Learnings are captured and shared widely in the org
	  
	  "We haven't failed, we have learnt"
	  
	  Of course, Edison is quoted at some point https://t.co/lMnQdw3hqA ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033686877966337))
	- So, what really happened here?
	  
	  Many possible reasons for this saga, but the most common ones:
	  
	  (A) The product should not have been built in the first place
	  
	  (B) The original product was ill-conceived & the later pivots had to inherit this original error
	  
	  Let's look at (A)üëáüèæ https://t.co/NheEGM4MoO ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033692569624576))
	- The product solved *a* problem
	  
	  But not *the* problem https://t.co/4zzChwg54p ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033699192430595))
	- Often, product teams want to be in the top right quadrant https://t.co/YgQgxUN1QV ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033704837935110))
	- But, there's more to the puzzle https://t.co/YnMVJbyo8l ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033712383516672))
	- We need to understand this
	  
	  And remember it https://t.co/QNqK1Nu3WG ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033720390455297))
	- Daniel Kahneman said:
	  
	  ‚ÄúNothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it‚Äù
	  
	  This is the Focusing Illusion. https://t.co/xOAA0RD08Z ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376037550603661317))
	- The Focusing Illusion, in business:
	  
	  ‚ÄúNothing in business is as important as it actually is, while you are talking about it.‚Äù https://t.co/2zL1F84iuR ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376037555401936896))
	- When you talk to a customer about a specific problem, they will naturally ‚Äúfocus‚Äù on that problem, at the exclusion of other problems they (or their business overall) is facing. 
	  
	  With this focus comes a disproportionate emphasis on solving THAT specific problem. https://t.co/qzkedsdcOe ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376037560204414978))
	- A good solution here:
	  Customer Problems Stack Rank (CPSR)
	  
	  Ask the customer to stack rank the problem vs. the other problems they are trying to solve for their business & org.
	  
	  Also get the CPSR from other personas involved: VP Support, VP Mktg...
	  
	  You are now closer to truth. https://t.co/NTCF6KIXM8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376037565057261571))

	- Executing well on an important problem is a necessary but not sufficient condition for business impact. Should also have a rigorous strategy. You don't *have* to write it down, though it often does help align the team better.
