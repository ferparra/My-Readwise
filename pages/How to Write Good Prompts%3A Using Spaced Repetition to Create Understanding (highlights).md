	- Retrieval practice prompts should be **focused.** A question or answer involving too much detail will dull your concentration and stimulate incomplete retrievals, leaving some bulbs unlit. Unfocused questions also make it harder to check whether you remembered all parts of the answer and to note places where you differed. It’s usually best to focus on one detail at a time.

	- Retrieval practice prompts should be **precise** about what they’re asking for. Vague questions will elicit vague answers, which won’t reliably light the bulbs you’re targeting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvw59wy6a3kefy3yymegg847))
	- Retrieval practice prompts should produce **consistent** answers, lighting the same bulbs each time you perform the task. Otherwise, you may run afoul of an interference phenomenon called “retrieval-induced forgetting”This effect has been produced in many experiments but is not yet well understood. For an overview, see Murayama et al, [Forgetting as a consequence of retrieval: a meta-analytic review of retrieval-induced forgetting](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/Murayama2014.pdf) (2014).: what you remember during practice is reinforced, but other related knowledge which you *didn’t* recall is actually inhibited. Now, there is a useful type of prompt which involves generating new answers with each repetition, but such prompts leverage a different theory of change. We’ll discuss them briefly later in this guide. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvw5a64qfakmr7wvh1fzee3d))
	- Retrieval practice prompts should be **tractable**. To avoid interference-driven churn and recurring annoyance in your review sessions, you should strive to write prompts which you can almost always answer correctly. This often means breaking the task down, or adding cues. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvw5a981b42srn9q8dkds3ww))
	- Retrieval practice prompts should be **effortful**. It’s important that the prompt actually involves retrieving the answer from memory. You shouldn’t be able to trivially infer the answer. Cues are helpful, as we’ll discuss later—just don’t “give the answer away.” In fact, effort appears to be an important factor in the effects of retrieval practice.For more on the notion that difficult retrievals have a greater impact than easier retrievals, see the discussion in Bjork and Bjork, [A New Theory of Disuse and an Old Theory of Stimulus Fluctuation](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/Bjork1992.pdf) (1992). Pyc and Rawson, [Testing the retrieval effort hypothesis: Does greater difficulty correctly recalling information lead to higher levels of memory?](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/Pyc2009.pdf) (2009) offers some focused experimental tests of this theory, which they coin the “retrieval effort hypothesis.” That’s one motivation for spacing reviews out over time: if it’s too easy to recall the answer, retrieval practice has little effect.
