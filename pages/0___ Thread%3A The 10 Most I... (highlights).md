		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ As a product manager or designer, there's a lot of biases that may lead to poorly designed products. Identifying these early could save you a significant amount of time along your product journey https://t.co/fF05p0bbev ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pinverrr/status/1198643721249660930))
	- 2/ As an early stage founder or product manager, don't underestimate the impact of positioning / repositioning. Every product can be positioned in multiple markets; carefully choosing the best one can help make your growth explode https://t.co/k74yeDG3ZX ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pinverrr/status/1198643723158065152))
	- 3/ As a founder about to launch your first product, take time to carefully consider the pros & cons of a self-serve mass freemium vs. a closed beta. In most cases, freemium traction yields more momentum for 1st time founders & accelerates learning https://t.co/j14MMA4G48 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pinverrr/status/1198643724835786752))
	- 4/ As a pre-product-market-fit founder, it's important to know what you're looking for. You have found product market fit when you can repeatably acquire customers for a lower cost than what they are worth to you. But how do you assess this early on? https://t.co/1tNIycpK1k ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pinverrr/status/1198643726563852288))
	- 5/ As a healthy & growing startup, don't panic if you see multiple direct competitors with more funding & better PR than you. It's ok to be #2. If you play your cards right, you can win the race slow and steadily https://t.co/cnAXX7JTOk ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pinverrr/status/1198643728291958785))
	- 6/ As a startup founder going from Seed to Series A & beyond, you should start prioritising professional development. Growing professionally at the same pace your company is scaling is hard. What got you here isn't enough to ensure success going forward https://t.co/tKeSdd15z1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pinverrr/status/1198643729814499328))
	- 7/ As a startup founder going from Seed to Series A & beyond, building financial spreadsheets & making projections may not feel very natural. Knowing what mistakes to avoid will make you look professional & better prepare you for future growth / rounds https://t.co/9348vTbRlq ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pinverrr/status/1198643731706077184))
	- 8/ As someone wanting to invest in / work for an early stage consumer-facing startup, watch for situations in which an idea sounds dumb, & yet you have a (usually very small) group of people highly engaged in doing it. It may not be as dumb as it looks https://t.co/UGTKTYwZDE ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pinverrr/status/1198643733262151685))
	- 9/ As a VC passing on a startup investment because "you donâ€™t see who on earth would acquire this startup", think twice. If a startup creates a product & builds a business around it, itâ€™s extremely likely that someone will want the asset https://t.co/0gciW3rPGP ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pinverrr/status/1198643735124414466))
	- 10/ M&A is such a crucial part of startups, yet it seems taboo to talk about the ins and outs of this process. Knowing what to look out for from an early start can make a huge difference in the outcome of your startup's journey https://t.co/1QZ9WqV9W3 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/pinverrr/status/1198643736831569920))
