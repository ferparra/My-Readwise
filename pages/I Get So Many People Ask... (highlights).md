	- I get so many people asking me how they can become a better developer. Many resources will take you from 0-60 but very few resources exist that will take you from 60-100. ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1442870467950374912))

	- Start writing and teaching. You always have something valuable to give. By teaching others and sharing knowledge, you actually improve your own skills at the same time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1442870469145743369))
	- Coding > Reading. Some reading is great! But you really need to set aside structured time to focus on coding and growing your skills. 
	  
	  While a book about weightlifting or knitting is great for the principles, you need to go to the gym or pick up the knitting needles to improve. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1442870470294925312))
	- Build a side project. Things really clicked for me when I had to build things on my own.
	  
	  If you don't have the time to work on a side project (totally ok!), you can learn at work by volunteering for new projects. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1442870471733641222))
	- Set a goal. Goals without direction are just wishes. You need to set a tangible goal to work towards.
	  
	  Maybe it's a new higher paid dev job, or a new job in blockchain. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1442870473109360651))
	- Take it easy on yourself. Appreciate how far you've come opposed to how far you have to go. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1442870474426384385))
