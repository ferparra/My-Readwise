	- I've been working on a new financial product with @danrobinson and the team @opyn_: the power perpetual.
	  
	  If the price of ETH doubles, the ETH^2 power perp 4Xs, the ETH^3 power perp 8Xs, and the ETH^5 power perp 32Xs.

	- Power perpetuals provide global options-like exposure without the need for either strikes or expiries, giving them the potential to consolidate much of options market liquidity into a single instrument.
	  
	  They can be thought of as offering pure convexity.

	- The ETH^2 power perpetual, affectionately known as "squeeth" (short for ETH squared), is particularly interesting.
	  
	  Because it has a constant gamma, it offers consistent optionality regardless of the price of ETH.

	- In many ways, power perpetuals are the logical next step from Everlasting Options, and they have been independently discovered at least two other times to our knowledge, by researchers @waynenilsen and @llllvvuu .

	- If you are as intrigued by this new primitive as we are, we would love to hear from you.
