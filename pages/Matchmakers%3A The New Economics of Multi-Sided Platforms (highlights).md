document_note:: Matchmakers or multi-sided platforms are businesses that facilitate connections between different groups by reducing transactional and other friction costs. They operate under different economic rules and seek to attract groups of customers who can benefit from interactions with each other. They often subsidize one side of the platform to encourage growth, and the prices for admission and growth must be high enough for the platform to make money.
