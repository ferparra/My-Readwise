	- NEW THREAD, easier to follow:
	  
	  Why on earth would the Biden White House be pushing proof-of-work at the expense of proof-of-stake, when environmentalism is a hallmark of the Administration and public perception is (albeit incorrectly) that PoW is killing the environment?!?

	- You can't have a credible theory about what the government is doing without being able to answer that astonishing puzzle.
	  
	  I submit there is only one explanation:
	  
	  The US Govt is purposefully leaving the door open to formally adopt bitcoin to some degree in the future.

	- In recent days I've been providing my followers a theory for the events that have been happening, and why they are a consistent, coordinated effort by the US Govt to signal the acceptance of bitcoin.
	  
	  3/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675147035103233))
	- The ultimate explanation is a theory outlined by @LynAldenContact, which I will outline in the next thread.
	  
	  (Thank you, Lyn, for frequently listening in on my Twitter Spaces, and I hope you join the stage soon with @mikealfred, whom I think may be a friend of yours.)

	- Let's take it step by step:
	  
	  The White House and the Senate, both controlled by Democrats no less, knowingly installed a SEC Chair, @GaryGensler, who taught bitcoin at MIT and who reveres Satoshi. That is no accident.
	  
	  5/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675149056806921))
	- Shortly after his confirmation, Gensler said that he had a problem with most cryptocurrencies, calling them unregulated securities. In the same remarks, he referred to bitcoin by contrast as a "store of value."
	  
	  6/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675150038233091))
	- On Tuesday, things got super interesting when Gensler gave his first extended public remarks on the industry.
	  
	  Watch, not read, his remarks and Q&A. The printed remarks don't contain his revealing expressions and the Q&A where he was more candid.

	- Gensler spoke of Satoshi in glowing terms, repeatedly. It felt like he was smiling down on us bitcoiners. He called bitcoin a speculative store of value, again.
	  
	  He made it clear that most cryptocurrencies are unregulated securities that he would be taking action against.
	  
	  8/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675151946719235))
	- The standard Gensler referred to was the Howey test, which states that a security is an "investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others."
	  
	  9/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675152915566593))
	- Which cryptocurrencies will Gensler allow? The ones that are now organic and leaderless (Howey test), and thus not under the purview of the SEC.
	  
	  He made it a point to underscore that Satoshi is absent.
	  
	  10/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675153880207366))
	- Gensler acknowledged he doesn't have the staff to go after 10,000+ cryptocurrencies, but implied that they would work with exchanges/platforms to de-list all problematic coins.
	  
	  He referred to lending platforms and DeFi as well as exchanges.
	  
	  11/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675155063050240))
	- Gensler said that an exchange that listed 5 coins might be OK, but one that listed 25 coins would very likely have a problem.
	  
	  In other words, >99.9% of coins would be disallowed because they have a [[leadership]] team and did not register with the SEC when they raised funds.
	  
	  12/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675156463976451))
	- The take-home message is that the SEC likes bitcoin, and that as an organic store of value it is not subject to SEC regulation.
	  
	  13/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675157596409861))
	- The next morning, the CFTC issued a tweet that was widely misinterpreted. At the time, I explained that it did not contradict Gensler, but backed him up, implying that certain digital assets (e.g., bitcoin) are "pure commodities."

	- That same day (Wednesday), Democratic Senator Ron Wyden joined Republicans Cynthia Lummis and Pat Toomey with an amendment to fix the very bad wording about cryptocurrencies in the infrastructure bill.
	  
	  15/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675159655845889))
	- Also on Wednesday, Democrat Elizabeth Warren began to walk back her harsh statements on cryptocurrencies, saying that investors need to have "confidence" from regulators if they are going to invest in crypto.
	  
	  16/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675160595369987))
	- Only one thing can explain two agencies in the Biden Administration and two Democratic Senators making friendly signals toward bitcoin within 24 hours: Coordinated instructions from the Biden White House.
	  
	  I noted this to my followers that day.
	  
	  17/25
	  
	  https://t.co/KWknrU4pEe ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675161547476997))
	- On Thursday, another amendment in competition to the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment appeared by surprise. This one came from Democrat Mark Warner and Republican Rob Portman.
	  
	  This amendment creates a safe space for proof-of-work specifically, excluding proof-of-state.
	  
	  18/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675162759548928))
	- Soon after, the White House surprised our community by entering the debate and shocked the community by endorsing the proof-of-work only amendment.
	  
	  Shocking because of the environmental narrative of the White House and the (false) narrative about PoW.
	  
	  19/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675163787157504))
	- But it did not shock me and those who have been following my line of thinking. I said the US Govt would likely increase their signaling for bitcoin to encourage investors to move out of altcoins and into bitcoin gradually, so as not to crash the altcoin market all at once.
	  
	  20/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675164739338246))
	- I'm sure there's been a bitcoin taskforce among the 3-letter agencies during the Obama/Trump/Biden years, gaming out the probabilities regarding bitcoin's success and particularly the implications of the US Govt banning or tolerating or embracing bitcoin.
	  
	  21/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675165691441157))
	- I believe this "deep state" task force made the decision to tolerate bitcoin knowing the US may need to fully embrace it at some point. And the time has now come to signal that publicly.
	  
	  Why would the US Govt want to formally embrace bitcoin?
	  
	  22/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675166752575495))
	- One reason is simply that if the US banned bitcoin, other countries that embraced it might replace the US in leading the world as a result. That's not a risk the US Govt wants to take.
	  
	  23/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675167696248842))
	- A more specific reason is the one outlined by @LynAldenContact: The US Govt can solve its Triffin Dilemma by embracing bitcoin as the world reserve asset (see link). @LukeGromen has also written about the TD.

	  https://t.co/lUtZi6aHLY ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675168656818176))
	- It's no longer in the interest of the US to hold the world's reserve currency. But the US surely doesn't want China or any other country to hold it.
	  
	  Neutral bitcoin is the best solution for the US.
	  
	  It wouldn't have to fully replace the USD, but it would go to the moon.
	  
	  25/25 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423675169743065090))
	- P.S. I don't endorse the gov't choosing winners and losers. I prefer the Wyden amendment that is favorable to both PoW and PoS. My point is to explain why the Gov't is behind BTC/PoW.
	  
	  It doesn't even matter which one passes. There's time to fix it. This was about *signaling*. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423679405847576583))
	- The market surged from 42,250 to 43,250 in the 10 minutes after I posted this thread. I doubt the thread is the cause.
	  
	  What's more important is that BTC went from 40k to 42k after last night's events that caused everyone to panic. Perhaps the big money already saw it like I did. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423690033815453697))
	- To be clear, we want to support the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment, even though, paradoxically, the other amendment is the one that wants to force proof-of-work. It also wants to force control and has other problems. And the gov't shouldn't be picking winners/losers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_log_scale_/status/1423699481510350852))
