document_note:: The book "Do the Work" by Steven Pressfield is a guide on how to push through fear, self-doubt, procrastination and other obstacles to achieve success. It is broken down into four parts: beginning, middle, middle part 2, and end. It encourages readers to stay primitive, trust the "soup" (their muse), be ready for resistance, and start before they are ready. Enemies include resistance, rational thought, and at times friends and family. Allies include stupidity, stubbornness, passion, blind faith, assistance, and friends and family. Pressfield emphasizes the importance of believing in something that cannot be seen, heard, touched, tasted or felt, and encourages readers to act first and revise later. He also encourages readers to expect a big crash and not take failure personally. Lastly, Pressfield encourages readers to stay stupid, finish the project, and be proud of their work.

	- Seven Principles of Resistance **-** there is an enemy; this enemy is implacable; this enemy is inside you; **the enemy is inside you, but it is not you**; you are not to blame for the resistance you hear in your head; the "real you" must duel the "resistance you"; resistance arises second; the opposite of resistance is assistance ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsfg1y0hs0ekznpxs597c6yd))
		- **Note**: The enemy inside: ðŸ¤”
		  face it, duel it, and resist âœŠ
		  for the real you inside ðŸ¤²
	- Resistance
	  
	  â€¢   Fear, self-doubt, procrastination, addiction, distraction, timidity, ego and narcissism, self-loathing, perfectionism
	  â€¢   Any act that rejects immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity
	  â€¢   Is invisible but can be felt
	  â€¢   Is insidious - will take any form necessary to deceive you
	  â€¢   Is always lying and full of shit
	  â€¢   Is impersonal - doesn't care who you are and acts objectively
	  â€¢   Is infallible - can navigate resistance by letting it guide us to that calling or purpose that we must follow before all others. **The more important a call or action is to our soul's evolution, the more resistance we will feel toward pursuing it**
	  â€¢   Is universal and never sleeps, it never goes away ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsfg2f3fk3g329bd2b21d2rb))
		- **Note**: Resistance is something that is hard to see but easy to feel. It is sneaky and will try to trick you. It doesn't matter who you are, it will always be there. Resistance will try to stop us from doing things that are important for us to do. It can help us to follow our dreams, but it also makes it hard to do so. It never goes away, so we have to be brave and keep chasing our dreams no matter how hard it is.
	- Rational thought
	  
	  â€¢   Comes from the ego
	  â€¢   Want to work from the Self, from instinct and intuition, the unconscious
	  â€¢   **The deeper the source we work from, the better the outcome will be and the more transformative it will be for us and those we share it with** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsfg35ysnwh9jm9jrjhs4xtv))
		- **Note**: The best way to get good results and help others is to do things that come from deep inside us, like our intuition and feelings. When we do this, our ideas will be more powerful and will have a greater impact on us and the people around us.
	- Stupidity
	  
	  â€¢   Stupidest guys the author knows - Lindbergh, Jobs, Churchill
	  â€¢   Ignorance and arrogance are the artist and entrepreneur's indispensable allies. Must have no idea how difficult the enterprise you are getting into truly is, and cocky enough to believe you can pull it off
	  â€¢   **Don't think. Act**
	  â€¢   We can always revise and revisit once we've acted. But we can accomplish nothing until we act ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsfg3p9vg4cchfm3nhhh6wnp))
		- **Note**: Stupidity means doing something without thinking about it first. The author knows some of the smartest people ever, like Lindbergh, Jobs, and Churchill. To be successful, it helps to be a bit ignorant and a bit confident. That means you don't worry too much about how hard something might be and you believe you can do it. Don't think too much, just act! You can always change things later, but you won't get anywhere until you take the first step.
