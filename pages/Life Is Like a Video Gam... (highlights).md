	- Life is like a video game. The ðŸ’µ question: which game are you playing?
	  
	  Is it Fortnite Battle Royale, where you outshine an arena of others? 
	  
	  Pokemon, where you collect and show off your rare finds?
	  
	  Minecraft or Roblox, meta-games where you build games that others play?

	- Or perhaps you're playing...
	  
	  Tetris, the game of slotting stuff into the right place with increasing intensity (aka management)
	  
	  Minesweeper, the game of avoiding being cancelled
	  
	  Myst, the game of figuring out what the hell this world is all about.

	- Some games are extraordinarily popular. When everyone around you is playing, it's easy to get swept up in them:
	  
	  The "Be influential on [App] about [Topic]" game
	  
	  The "Show off your wealth and fancy possessions" game
	  
	  The "Look attractive and get liked" game

	- But there are a stunning variety of games you can play:
	  
	  The "Make money off crypto" game
	  
	  The "BTS ARMY breaks records" game
	  
	  The "Make others laugh" game
	  
	  The "Help someone else reach their full potential" game

	- The lesson many eventually learn is that the game we've spent years playing turns out not to be the right one.
	  
	  It's like discovering all your life you've been trying to win at competitive Street Fighter when what you really love is Final Fantasy.

	- And the problem with most advice you get is that someone will say: "Oh, to get to the next level, you just need to mash the 'jump' button twice as quickly as you can and press Y." 
	  
	  And their advice might be absolutely spot-on if you're playing Mario. But are you?

	- So how do you find the game that's right for you?
	  
	  1) Ask others what they're playing to know the options. "What drives you?"
	  2) Try out a bunch of different games.
	  3) Think about yourself at 80--what will you be proud that you played? 
	  4) Avoid comparisons.

	- What game am I playing these days?
	  
	  1) Can I show up for my family, friends and community in accordance with my values?
	  2) Can I learn and better myself every single day?
	  3) Can I create at the peak of what I am capable of?
