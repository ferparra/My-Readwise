	- My biggest secret to running an impactful marketing team isn't my depth of experience and skillset.
	  
	  It's a simple framework called the GACCS that I came up w/ while leading marketing at @Asana. And I just wrote about it for @lennysan Newsletter
	  
	  Here’s how it helps: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/emilykramer/status/1574797118618755074))

	- The GACCS is a marketing brief that's worth writing. If OKRs help you define your goals, the GACCS helps you hit your goals.
	  
	  For everything you create: know why you are doing it, who it’s for, how it will add value & where you’ll distribute it.  The GACCS covers all of this.

	- Writing the GACCS is a great gut check on if marketing work is worth doing.
	  
	  While the GACCS might seem like busy work, it actually helps you avoid busy work. Taking the time to write it helps you make sure the project can have an impact. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/emilykramer/status/1574797129448448013))
	- After you write the GACCS use it to get buy-in before you spend time doing the work.
	  
	  Put the GACCS at the top of every project doc, in each Asana task, or in Slack. Then share it with other teams. 10 mins now; hours saved running in circles later.

	- And for all my fellow millennials who watched a lot of @nickelodeon, it's not 100% accidental that the name sounds like GAK. That's part of the magic.
