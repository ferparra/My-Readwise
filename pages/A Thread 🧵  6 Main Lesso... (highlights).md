	- A thread 🧵 
	  6 main lessons from “Working Backwards” - how Amazon built its invention machine
	  
	  1/6 Going slow to go fast 
	  Take the time to think deeply about customer to form a clear vision. AWS took 18+ months before code, reached $10B rev in <4 yrs

	- 2/6 Take the contrarian approach of innovating around customer’s needs instead of your skill set. 
	  
	  In 2004, when 77% of Amazon’s revenue was physical media products, it started to think about building a digital media business, something it knew nothing about. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/christinexzhu/status/1366121097368903684))
	- 3/6 Stay flexible on the details, but innovation needs to be well staffed.
	  
	  The demand of core business tend to soak up bandwidth with leaders. Amazon’s single-threaded [[leadership]] gave them focus to devote time & attention to make a new business successful. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/christinexzhu/status/1366121098174210048))

	- 4/6 Build by working backwards.
	  
	  This is the well known PR/FAQ document. Writing the press release at the beginning of a new product build pushes us to think bigger and let the best ideas rise. FAQs are designed to uncover and address potential potholes early on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/christinexzhu/status/1366121098987847680))
	- 5/6 Good intentions don’t work, mechanisms do.
	  
	  Processes and incentives need to be in place to cultivate the culture you desire. For example, the correction of errors report is used for teams to identify the “why’s” behind an error. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/christinexzhu/status/1366121099768037380))
	- 6/6 Great operators dive into the details
	  
	  Good operators understand what inputs get what results. Ie. identifying the controllable input metrics is just as important on the output metrics (profit or growth). Input metrics should describe how the customer used the product. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/christinexzhu/status/1366121100552392712))
