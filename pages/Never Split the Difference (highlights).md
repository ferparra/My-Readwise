	- Before going into a negotiation, consider best and worst case outcomes. BATNA can lower your vision and close off opportunities for better things. Focus on your high end goal, – expect more and get more. Describe the lay of the land, how you got there, what you want, what the other side wants, non-cash considerations you’d want. The other should agree with all of it before starting ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1c8begvt2nwtfs4912wn9y))
	- Labels
	  
	  1.  Understand the power of labels – it seems like you value x, it seems like you don’t want y. You think that… Then ask if that’s true. If you get this right, it makes the other side feel truly heard and if you don’t, it gives them a chance to correct you which is helpful to both sides
	  2.  Really listen and put yourself in your counterparty’s shoes. Don’t just listen to their words, but what their deeper preferences are. Try to understand what the other side really wants
	  3.  Emotions aren’t obstacles, but the means. Never ignore the other sides’ feelings. Make them feel heard and then label it. This is tactical empathy. It seems like you are worried about…
	  4.  You put yourself in their shoes, perceive what they’re feeling and put those feelings into words
	  5.  Labeling is giving an emotion a name and it shows the other side you hear and understand them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1c85drrjxs5vmny7m6z65v))
		- **Note**: The main point of the text is that labels can be a powerful tool in negotiation. Labelling involves understanding the counterparty's preferences and emotions and putting them into words. It shows that the other side is being heard and understood, and helps to create a better understanding between both sides. Tactical empathy is also used to understand the other side's feelings and put them into words.
	- Jedi Mind Tricks
	  
	  1.  Mirroring back 1-3 key words is incredibly effective. It’s like a Jedi mind trick. Use a deep and calm voice, say “I’m sorry…” followed by repeating the key words, then allow for silence
	  2.  Saying, “We just want what’s fair” is a powerful level setter
	  3.  When you make a mistake, own up to it clearly. “Look, I know I’m an asshole…”
	  4.  Getting someone to say, “That’s right” shows you’re truly on the right path
	  5.  The most direct path is indirect. Let the other side go first truly listen and make them feel like they are in control.
	  6.  This is what a great deal looks like to me
	  7.  I have a lousy proposition for you… ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1c8jmv9e3h1fv9vzp3bc8r))
		- **Note**: Never Split the Difference outlines seven principles for effective negotiation, including mirroring back key words, setting a fair level, owning up to mistakes, getting the other side to agree, listening, understanding the other side's perspective, and making a proposal.
	- While win-win is drilled into us from a young age, compromise is often disastrous. No deal is better than a bad deal. Never split the difference. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1c6rtfj907ftb0hq4kqc3n))
	- Calibrated Questions
	  
	  1.  You have to have incredible emotional control in order to be a great negotiator. The same calibrated question can be conveyed as aggressive or empathetic
	  2.  Ask calibrated questions that start with “how” or “what”. “Why?” generally elicits defensive explanations. You can get influence through deference which is why asking “how?” and “what?” questions leads to ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1c6wk1yxn360cb3wbhvbes))
	- Knowing your negotiation style and your counterparts’ is important so you know how to proceed with your strategy. There are 3 broad categories of people – accommodators, aggressive, analysts. Each style can be effective and you need to combine to be your best. Thinking that you’re normal or average is hugely destructive. You have to understand your style, but also other people styles in order to be as effective as possible. People mistake there limits for the limits of the world. Don’t treat people the way you wanna be treated, but the way they need to be treated
	  
	  1.  Analysts are methodical and diligent and want to minimize mistakes and take their time. They’re hyper sensitive to reciprocity and are very skeptical.
	  2.  Accommodators care about relationships more than anything and want win/win. They don’t have a great bias for action and avoid conflict.
	  3.  Assertive people believe time is money. Done is better than perfect. They’re blunt and to the point. They want to be heard and focus on own goals rather than people. You have to listen to them before they take the time to listen to you
	  4.  Time and Silence are thought about differently by each group. Time = Preparation, relationship, money, Silence = time to think, build rapport, talk ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1c710v7tzjavqgnhjre2qg))
		- **Note**: This text discusses the three main negotiation styles - accommodators, aggressive, and analysts - and the importance of understanding both your own and your counterpart's style. It also highlights the differences between how each group views time and silence, and the importance of treating people how they need to be treated instead of how you want to be treated.
	- Positive, negative, and normative leverage.
	  
	  1.  If you can give or takeaway what the other side wants, you have positive leverage.
	  2.  Negative leverage is based on threats.
	  3.  Normative leverage is using other sides values and beliefs against them. Establishing rapport and shared identity and framing things within the worldview of your counter party increases your normative leverage in substantial ways. For example, if you’re dealing with a veteran, they have certain senses of duties that others might not share. If someone is deeply religious, there are certain themes, concepts, ideas, and beliefs that carry more wait for them than others. Come to understand their worldviews, and what really matters to them in your unlock normative leverage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt1c7e0teaea28ckmthyydy3))
		- **Note**: The three types of leverage discussed in this text are positive, negative, and normative. Positive leverage is based on giving or taking away what the other side wants. Negative leverage is based on threats. Normative leverage is using other sides values and beliefs against them, such as establishing rapport and shared identity and framing things within the worldview of the counterparty. This helps to increase the normative leverage.

		- **Note**: Ackerman negotiation involves determining one's reservation price, anchoring at 65% of the reservation price, then incrementally offering 85%, 95% and ending at 100% of the reservation price. This process devalues the item's perceived worth.
