	- The most important
	  aspect of learning piano is brain development and higher intelligence. Memory
	  is a component of intelligence and we know how to improve memory
	- Hands separate
	  practice is the only way to rapidly increase speed and control without getting
	  into trouble.
	- Hands separate practice is the only
	  way in which you can experiment to find the correct hand motions for speed and
	  expression and it is the fastest way to learn how to relax.
	- Practicing slowly hands together and gradually ramping up the speed is what
	  we tend to do intuitively, but it turns out to be one of the worst ways to
	  practice because it wastes so much time and you are training the hands to
	  execute slow motions that are different from what you need at the final speed.
