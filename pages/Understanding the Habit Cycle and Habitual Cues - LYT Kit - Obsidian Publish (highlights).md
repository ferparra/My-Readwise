	- Cue (Make it Obvious vs Invisible)
	  Craving (Make it Attractive vs Unattractive) - timing is important
	  Routine (Make it Easy vs Difficult)
	  Reward (Make it Satisfying vs Unsatisfying) - Behaviors that are immediately rewarded get repeated. Behaviors that are immediately punished don't get repeated. That's why you need to make it enjoyable in the moment. One way is tying your identity to it. Frame your rewards.
