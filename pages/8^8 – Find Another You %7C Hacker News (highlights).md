	- The Myers-Briggs places weight on questions to give one of the 16 personality types made of 8 traits. For example, one answer might give you 80% of INTJ and 20% INTP and by factoring the weights across all the questions will tell you if you were weighted more or less towards INTJ or INTP, even if you were more INTJ for that singular question.In 8x8 the questions are not weighted in that way, which is an important difference. While there are 16 distinct personality traits in MBTI, there are only 8 traits. Questions can weigh towards those 8 traits in various ways. From my experience MBTI tests range from the 5 "strongly, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly" answer types and the questions are targeted to 2 (sometimes 4, but typically 2) traits.
