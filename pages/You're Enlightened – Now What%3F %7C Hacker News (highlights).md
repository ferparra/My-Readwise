	- Zen saying: "Before enlightenment chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment chop wood, carry water".
	- “Before one studies Zen, mountains are mountains and waters are waters; after a first glimpse into the truth of Zen, mountains are no longer mountains and waters are no longer waters; after enlightenment, mountains are once again mountains and waters once again waters.”― Dōgen
	- If you are in flat land (a beginner), you see mountains as mountains. Well defined features on the horizon.Once you start climbing, you concentrate on the details of the concrete mountain in front of you (rocks, moss, shrubs, ice, snow, caves) and your inner concept of a mountain changes into a collection of such details.But once you summit, mountains around look like well defined features on the horizon again. Just like from the flat land of the beginners, only the perspective has changed.
