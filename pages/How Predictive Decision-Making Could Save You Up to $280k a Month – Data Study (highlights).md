	- Value can be interpreted in various ways, but this study focused on identifying the monetary effect of predictive insights, and more specifically the impact of being able to make optimization decisions earlier in a campaign’s lifetime than before.
	  
	  How did we quantify predictive value?
	  
	  There are different ways to assess the value of predictive insight, depending on what you’re trying to achieve. You may want to measure:
	  
	  1.  **Cost savings:** budgets that can be saved by taking quick action and terminating a poorly-performing campaign
	  2.  **Revenue boost:** additional revenue that can be gained by identifying high-performing campaigns early and increasing their budget and/or bid
	  3.  **Alternative cost:** the potential impact of a dollar reallocated from a poorly-performing channel to a successful one ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxa1md3n8d257t6x730ag68z))
	- Early decision-making is worth its weight in gold
	  
	  Launching new campaigns can be an expensive task if you don’t have the right business insights. You can easily burn through your marketing budget while you wait for sufficient data measurements to build up.
	  
	  The ability to get performance insights as early as 48 hours into a campaign’s run-time translates into earlier decision-making and earlier actions, which in turn shift the return on investment (ROI) needle in the right direction.

	- Data limitations affect campaign scale
	  
	  Apple’s SKAN has dramatically affected the way advertisers operate and manage their iOS budgets. You might be put off by the lack of clarity created by privacy limitations and restricted measurement windows — and you’re not alone.
	  
	  While this is a large-scale effect of Apple’s privacy constraints, predictive data offers a solution by leveraging early measurement to get clarity over predicted future activity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxa1q2x0kbsrextd7f1zzdaf))
