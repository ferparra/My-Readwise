document_note:: In this episode, Naval Ravikant discusses the idea that abstract mathematical theories may not have any mapping to reality, as well as the concept of unifying quantum theory and General relativity. He also talks about Turing's proof of what is and is not computable, and how mathematicians cannot step outside the laws of physics. Finally, he discusses the idea of uncertainty, randomness, and probability, and whether light is a particle or a wave.

- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Mar 9th, 2023]]
	- Life is continuously getting better thanks to science and we take it for granted ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtwq14eksg3d8d1s54k3t6qj))
	- Science is also the study of truth
	  
	  •   “How do we know something to be true”? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtwq19t11mzevpcyrza1v4y7))
	- Naval finds most “Mental Models” people talk about not worth paying attention to
	  
	  •   **The mental models in “The Beginning of Infinity” are transformational**
	    •   **They completely change the way you look at what is true and what isn’t** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtwq2jgvk1c5p450k6npnk39))
	- **Certain fundamental theories allow you to form a lens through which you can understand anything that can be understood**
	  
	  •   Quantum theory
	    •   Regarded deeper, more foundational, than the theory of relativity
	    •   Some physicists expect a unification of the two in the future
	  •   The theory of computation
	  •   Evolution by natural selection
	  •   Epistemology (Theory of Knowledge) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtxc2fvrzshdmda39z8gdsd4))
	- Deutsch’s worldview is deeply optimistic
	  
	  •   **Reality is comprehensible and problems are solvable**
	    •   Anything not forbidden by the laws of physics is possible
	  •   **Progress is inevitable as long as we have good explanations**
	  •   **Humans are universal explainers**
	    •   Anything that can be known, can be known by humans
	    •   Humans are the beginning of an infinite knowledge
	    •   We can constantly replace old theories with improved ones
	    •   There’s no endpoint ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtxc38a1m6gmre4vzh08ejkf))
	- **Good explanations are**
	  
	  •   **Testable and falsifiable**
	    •   You should be able to run experiments and test if they are true or not
	  •   **Creative**
	    •   They may not be obvious to find and involve some creative thinking ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtxc5grha38sxvh3jsva18zr))
	- **Good, scientific explanations**:
	  
	  •   Are testable, falsifiable, and hard to vary
	  •   Make bold and narrow predictions
	  •   Rely on creativity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtxc7tvezhsn7a1chqscc3h5))
	- A good application of Bayesianism is the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)
	  
	  •   If you’re given the choice to pick one of three doors, knowing that behind a door stands a prize
	  •   You pick the first door randomly, and later you find that one of the doors you didn’t pick doesn’t contain the prize
	  •   You get offered to change your choice to the other closed door, do you switch?
	  •   Yes, because when you first picked the door you had a 33% chance of winning the prize
	    •   The other two doors constituted a 66% chance of winning
	  •   It may be easier to understand this thinking about picking 1 door out of 100 hundred, and then 98 empty doors being revealed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtxc8kgxk3twmvcbedch1jmd))
		- **Note**: The Monty Hall problem is a good example of Bayesianism. It involves choosing one of three doors, with the prize behind one of them. After randomly choosing the first door, the player is offered to switch to the other closed door. According to the Bayesian thinking, the player should switch, as the first pick only had a 33% chance of winning, whereas the other two doors had a 66% chance of winning. This concept can also be understood by imagining picking one door out of 100, with the other 98 being empty.
