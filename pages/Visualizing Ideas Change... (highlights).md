	- Visualizing ideas changed my life (quicker than I expected):
		- **Note**: Thread
	- I was an aspiring creator for years. Tried youtube, blogs, and even sharing my ideas via podcast.
	  
	  But to me, it felt like an uphill battle and I gave up‚Ä¶ 
	  
	  3 years had passed and I was still struggling to find "my thing"

	- Then I discovered visuals on @JamesClear blog and later @jackbutcher showed me there is a market for it.
	  
	  I was hooked to give visuals a try.
	  
	  It ended up being fun, sustainable and I loved that majority of ‚Äúwork‚Äù happened by thinking about how to illustrate different concepts... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OzolinsJanis/status/1455873545079123969))
	- Visualizing and putting it on paper was the easy part (regardless of not being a designer).
	  
	  It turned out that visuals were my way to share ideas online.
	  
	  Maybe the same is true for you? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OzolinsJanis/status/1455873546308124674))
	- A couple of months into the visual journey I kept refining what I did and freelance opportunities started to roll in.
	  
	  I was surprised because I didn‚Äôt promote myself as a freelancer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OzolinsJanis/status/1455873547616743433))
	- Today, I feel grateful to say ‚Äòno‚Äô to 90% of the offers that come my way.
	  
	  It just makes me think about what a huge demand there is for this type of work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OzolinsJanis/status/1455873548740796419))
	- My recent project is with @anafabrega11 where I help to visualize her ideas and spread the message about her thoughts on the future of education.
	  
	  If you would tell me this a year ago, I wouldn't have believed you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OzolinsJanis/status/1455873549818740741))
	- I‚Äôm not only a practitioner of this craft but a consumer as well. I love seeing work from others like @ash_lmb and @delivreal to name a few.
	  
	  I love that it brings a new understanding of ideas and saves me time to understand a concept that others explain in long articles. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OzolinsJanis/status/1455873550900809734))
	- I hope more people will explain ideas visually and even create books where visuals replace lots of words and make the book more digestible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/OzolinsJanis/status/1455873552029155333))
	- All the above is the reason I‚Äôm creating a course + plus community.
