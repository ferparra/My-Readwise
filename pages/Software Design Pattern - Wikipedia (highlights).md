	- Adapter, Wrapper, or Translator
	  
	  Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. An adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. The enterprise integration pattern equivalent is the translator.
	- Decorator
	  
	  Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically keeping the same interface. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
	- Module
	  
	  Group several related elements, such as classes, singletons, methods, globally used, into a single conceptual entity.
	- Iterator
	  
	  Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
