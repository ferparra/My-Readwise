- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 18th, 2022]]
	- Finished a 14 day experiment with a continuous glucose monitor in my arm. Learnt a lot about how my body reacts to food!
	  
	  ðŸ§µw graphs below. May be useful for folks with high blood sugar
	  
	  All food in this thread was home cooked. I wrote some python to extract & clean the data https://t.co/VwC9W5ZMoL ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rishdotblog/status/1382264657608544264))
	- A surprising learning for me â€“ carb heavy meals after not eating for a while cause a huge sugar spike!
	  
	  Rajma + a whole meal wrap after 22 hours of fasting led to this. When intermittent fasting, will avoid a carb-heavy lunch from now [2/] https://t.co/dxWC9vuAH8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rishdotblog/status/1382264663585398791))
	- The impact of refined carbs was stark, too. Rotis (made with wheat atta) led to a really bad spike here
	  
	  It would've likely been worse if not for a short (~10min) walk right after eating [3/] https://t.co/tUcNVPmqqD ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rishdotblog/status/1382264669365182468))
	- But going for long walks after eating high-carb, high-calorie meals can lead to a less extreme response
	  
	  In this graph, I had the same amount of paneer as in the graph above and the wraps had the same amt of carbs as the rotis. But a long (~5km) walk meant no sugar spike [4/] https://t.co/XzCpmEXUdV ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rishdotblog/status/1382264675048382475))
	- Low carb, high-fat foods led to almost no rise in blood sugar while being super satiating
	  
	  For instance, the eggs & avocado toast below (cooked in olive oil, with some feta cheese) was around 600 calories and led to no blood sugar spike whatsoever! [5/] https://t.co/9KhMNYcLQ7 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rishdotblog/status/1382264680782073857))
	- Lastly, it's not just about what you eat. Portion size is as important. If I overeat healthy things (like chicken breast+feta+capsicum wraps, or wholemeal oats), my blood sugar still spikes a lot
	  
	  Though overeating high carb things (rajma, pizza) is much worse [6/] ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rishdotblog/status/1382264683663486979))
	- Will definitely get a CGM for my parents so they can see what food items lead to a sugar spike for them. Continuous measurement will help identify dietary culprits
	  
	  Also hope that the Apple Watch 7 has an optical glucose monitor â€“Â will help diabetics save so much money! [7/] ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rishdotblog/status/1382264686410752003))
	- I'll likely combine this data with step count, heart rate, and sleep data from Fitbit and then publish it to Github as a weekend project
	  
	  Many [[startups]] (like https://t.co/BuvkodmM3R) are emerging in the wearable-enabled health space. Super excited about the future! [/fin] ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rishdotblog/status/1382264688918949895))
