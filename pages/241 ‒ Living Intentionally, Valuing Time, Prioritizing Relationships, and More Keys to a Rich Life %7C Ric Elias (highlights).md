	- The Importance of Crystallized Intelligence
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Arthur discusses the difference between fluid and crystallized intelligence and how it affects our ability to stay productive as we age., * Both participants agree that it is important to stay on the field, but understand that it is okay to move to a different position.)

	  Speaker 1
	  I've read excerpts. I listen to your podcast. I talk to him. I don't know him as well as you do, but we know each other. I think a lot of what he says around this and is crystallized intelligence that he talks about. I think it's interesting because I lack about 30 points of IQV to be the two of you. Like literally I listen to the podcast and I'm like, all right, I have a pause and go look at some stuff in the dictionary. But to me, the crystallized intelligence is more to me of the evolution of our brains and the aging of our brain, but that way that we stay productive for the tribe, for the society more than a elevation of it is an evolutionary off notwithstanding. I thought your podcast with him was tremendous.

	  I really enjoyed speaking with Arthur. I enjoyed his book. I read it twice. And I really it hit home a lot because even though I'm not yet 50, there's simply no question. I don't have the horsepower I had when I was 20 or 25. Like where I feel like I was really at my cerebral peak. And I think as he talked about and wrote about the transition from fluid to crystallized intelligence, it really gave me some comfort in accepting this transition so that to your point and why I brought this up is, yeah, I think it is important to stay on the field, but I also think it's important to understand that it's okay to move to a different position.

	  Well said, I think that replacing this notion of like, I don't have the horsepower is redefining what that horsepower is. ([Time 0:19:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ec65b163-75c9-4b16-a6b1-6f7ec23626f7))
