document_note:: The Landing Pages resource teaches how to design a homepage that entices visitors and converts them into customers. There are three common landing pages: the homepage, persona landing page, and product page structured identically. The more a landing page detours from the suggested template, the more confused the average visitor may become. Creativity should only be used when necessary. The template is displayed, and each element is explained in detail with visuals. In addition, strategies for writing enticing headers, subheaders, social proof, features and objections, and calls-to-action are covered with visual examples. The resource also recommends getting feedback from unbiased individuals and fine-tuning the landing page based on the feedback received.

	- three common landing pages:  
	  
	  •   **Homepage** — Your catch-all for all visitors.
	  •   **Persona landing page** — A page tailored to a specific persona (audience).
	  •   **Product page** — A page that walks through how your product works. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gybg88sm09hv7g2d8txvgzpj))
	- Think of your landing page from the perspective of a visitor's likelihood to purchase:
	  
	  > Purchase Rate = Desire - (Labor + Confusion) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gybg8fkxxq6jr9kcx1z49pa8))
	- To increase a visitor's purchase rate, increase the visitor's desire while decreasing their labor and confusion:
	  
	  •   **Increase desire** — Entice visitors with how much value you provide. Create intrigue.
	  •   **Decrease labor** — Reduce the work your visitors have to perform so they don't get tired or annoyed. Be concise and ensure every word and element is of value.
	  •   **Decrease confusion** — Don't confuse visitors with obscure or verbose messaging. Ensure every sentence can be easily understood. And make it self-evident which action they should take next (e.g. sign up or purchase). And ensure your action elements (e.g. buttons) are unmissable.

	- The header must be fully descriptive of what you're selling. Because, if the visitor doesn't understand precisely what you do immediately upon landing, they'll bounce out of laziness or skim-read the rest of the page and risk getting the wrong impression.

	- **Interest** — Rate how well the page sustained your interest on a scale of 1-10. What do you suggest be rewritten or redesigned to help it better sustain your interest? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gybg4p49hksexr6f8jm6e9mg))
