	- The world is so crazy right now, in my opinion, that everyone who engages the craziness, if only to fight it, becomes noticeably more crazy in the process.
	  
	  If this is false, who sees the madness, has fought it, and has not been diminished by it? I’m not sure of a counterexample. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein/status/1403066799348805632))
	- I may be confused, but I see a world dissolving in a rainbow of spectral Nihilism: anti-natalism, critical theory, post-modernism, equality of outcome, etc.
	  
	  Great music doesn’t save the world directly. It viscerally reminds us of why humanity is worth saving. GU may fix this. https://t.co/1InHQ4Oesj ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein/status/1403434464328355846))
	- There is something about nameless faceless communication corporations going after actual individual humans from behind their algorithmic curtains that strikes me as….how do you say it…..pure unadulterated evil.
	  
	  We need to demand the ability to opt *out* of corporate bullying. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein/status/1443622221029642240))
	- Oh for f’s sake. Science didn’t lose the public trust.
	  
	  Academicians stripped of academic freedom lost public trust. Irreproducible Peer reviewed papers lost public trust. Public health lost public trust.
	  
	  Is ANYONE worried about Avogadro’s number or the genetic code being wrong? https://t.co/TrnScbBegt ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein/status/1419689668019318786))
	- The W boson starts off massless, but acquires a (soft) mass by ‘eating’ another particle called a Goldstone Boson. This seems to indicate that by weighing it very precisely, we can deduce that it **may** have ‘eaten’ something else while we weren’t looking.
	  
	  HUGE **if** true. #IF https://t.co/UeEECrWZPH ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein/status/1512224096041545741))
	- What is the most boring sounding book that changed & improved your life immeasurably?
	  
	  Three candidates from my life that, frustratingly, I can’t generically recommend to friends:
	  
	  A) Einstein Manifolds by Besse.
	  B) Turkish Grammar by Underhill
	  C) Science Since Babylon by Price. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein/status/1591803285459156997))
	- This is trivially easy to resolve among smart knowledgeable people of good faith. We are not them apparently.
