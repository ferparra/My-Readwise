	- "Run your data team like a product team"
	  
	  This was gold from @emilieschario and @tayloramurphy, but I've heard it misinterpreted often. IMO the core idea is: product teams have great processes that data teams would do well to adapt and adopt. (1/n) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/imrobertyi/status/1582477030376886273))

	- In my estimation, this comes down to two key ideas:
	  
	  1. User-centricity
	  2. Proactivity ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/imrobertyi/status/1582477032927076353))
	- Great product teams are user-centric: they listen to customers and let this inform their roadmap.
	  
	  Data teams should do likewise. Our customers = stakeholders + the business. We should live and breathe business needs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/imrobertyi/status/1582477035540078592))
	- Great product teams are also proactive, not just building whatever solution is suggested by customers, but defining a vision, setting aside time to synthesize.
	  
	  Data teams are too often reactive. We should instead be looking for patterns, building our roadmap intentionally. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/imrobertyi/status/1582477038086070272))
	- Obv this is easier said than done. But two steps you can take to unblock better behaviors:
	  
	  1. Centralize your work üìï
	  2. Recognize that business context is half your job üè¢ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/imrobertyi/status/1582477040657104896))
	- Centralize your analytics work üìï
	  
	  Putting work in one place lets you pattern match. Set up processes to review your team's work so you can figure out more intentionally: what proactive analyses would add value across the board, what initiatives should you take on? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/imrobertyi/status/1582477043219845120))
	- If you're not centralizing work, you're flying in the dark.
	  
	  Quick plug for @hyperquery. A common problem here: attempts at analytics consolidation are often low-compliance. hyperquery gets around this by lowering the friction to make work that's immediately shareable ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/imrobertyi/status/1582477045799321600))
	- W/some effort, you can get tools like Notion/Confluence working, but stale results + lack of reproducibility are a slog. Notebooks also aren't quite right - great for research, but too hard for stakeholders to join in.

	- Last point: recognize that business context is half your job üè¢
	  
	  Analysts are positioned between data and the business. If you're just focused on technical skills, working w/data, you're neglecting half of your responsibility. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/imrobertyi/status/1582477050991980545))
	- All-in-all: analysts should take business context seriously + centralize our work so we can be:
