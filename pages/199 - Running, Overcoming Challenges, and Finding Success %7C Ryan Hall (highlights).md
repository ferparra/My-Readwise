	- Progressive Overload
	  
	  Summary:
	  "It's all just a giant experiment, right? And your's always like tweaking little variables. That's what i love about fitness, running all that stuff, as i love seeing growth," he says. "I love the frustration of getting plateaus and be like, what is going on right now?" 'And then i'm just making little little tweaks till i find it,' she adds.

	  So ou's just, that's the funn thing about running, train lifting, it's all just an experiment of one andus all just a giant experiment, right? And your's always like tweaking little variables. And that's what i love about fitness, running all that stuff, as i love seeing growth. I love just, like the frustration of not seeing growth, getting plateaus and be like, what is going on right now? And like, my mind's just like chewing on this over and over again for like, months and months. And then i'm just making little little tweaks till i find it. Then you find it, an bang, it clicks, you know? And whether it's in the waitroom or running, all a sudden you're doing what you couldn't do before, and you're like, ah, i just love, i love learning and growing in that way. You know.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Well, you really touched on a lot of things there, but one of them is this concept of progressive overload. And i think that that is one of the hardest things to really do when you're training yourself. Is most us are, right? Most of us, we're just count o week end warriors, and were we're sort of our own coaches. And it is very easy to get kind of comfortable. And again, it's true in the weight room. It's true on the bike. It's true if you're running, or whatever it is you're doing. But therein lies the challenge of being able to progressively overload, which doesn't always mean weight. It can mean sets, it can mean reps, it can mean reduction in rest time. There's so many ways that one can progressively overload.

	- I'm a Runner, and I've been working on this for a while.
	  
	  Summary:
	  The mark of a great runner, or a person who is very good at generating force, is you should have a higher vertical jump when you jump off a box and land and go up. Most people don't. And the reason is their ground contact time is way too long, and they ate weigh too much force. So i'm still jumping higher from a static than off a box. And my ground contact time has always been north of point three seconds. I forget the metrics that i believe you want to be beneath.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  So now you put it in front of a box, and you have the athlete jump off the box, hit the ground and jump up. Now it gives you two pieces of information. It tells you how long you were in contact with the ground and how you went. And the mark of a great runner, or a person who is very good at generating force, is you should have a higher vertical jump when you jump off a box and land and go up, than just static. Most people don't. Most people will jump higher static off the ground than off the box. And the reason is their ground contact time is way too long, and they ate weigh too much force. I forget the metrics that i believe you want to be beneath. Point two, eight seconds of ground contact time, i think that's the number. I struggle with this. So i'm still jumping higher from a static than off a box. And my ground contact time is always north of point three seconds. So this is one of the things i've been working on, not because i'm remotely interested in running fast, but because i'm interested in my feet becoming very good at load dissipation and load transfer and force transfer. So i think that's just a very important skill as you age, whether you're walking down a flight of stairs, whether you're hiking. But for a runner, i would suspect if you could get people down into a ground contact tind of like point two to point two five, that's going to translate to exactly what you're saying.

	- Don't Give Up, Just Keep Moving
	  
	  Summary:
	  "What's going on in your head is hugely important," he says. "You just turn the mind off, and you just like, keep putting one foot in front of the other." The last five k of the boston marathon were his most difficult.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  That's a thing about distance running, it's really like, what's going on in your head is hugely important. Eh? And so like, now, like, when i'm training athletes on the mental aspect of it, i tell them, like, you got to have a whole bunch of different, like, arrows, essentially, that you can pull out and use asnce. Like, sometimes you use one thing, it doesn't work, you got to go to something else. And then doesn't work. Have all these different tactics and managing pain and discomfort. But like, honestly, like one of the biggest ones that is most helpful for me, its simply turning the mind off. You just turn the mind off, and you just like, keep putting one foot in front of the other. It sounds so simple and so basic, but like, i can tell you, like the last five k of the boston marathon, when i'm in a world of pain and just trying to get to the finish line as fast as i can, there's no like, profound thoughts going through here. It's just like, put one foot in other as fast as you can. Like, it's that simple. So in those moments, like, oftentimes i'm just like, turn the brain off and just keep moving. Just keep moving. And a lot of it just like two like refusing to believe that you can't take one more step. Like, you get yourself, at least i get myself in trouble when i start thinking too far down the road. I'm like, i saw ive so far to go. There's no way i could possibly do this. Like, you get overwhelmed by the the scope of the challenge sometimes, especially when you'ree trying to do something you've never done.

	- Can I Love Myself That Way, Oftentimes?
	  
	  Summary:
	  "My identity was all wrapped up in my performances. And yet, like that is not the best way for my body to absorb the work," he says. "If i go into these workouts confident i who i am, and knowing the purpose of the workout, then i'm much better place."
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Eght. And yet, like that is not the best way for my body to absorb the work. Like i need to be making deposits, not making withdrawals, when i'm training. So if if i go into these workouts confident i who i am, and knowing the purpose of the workout, then i'm much better place. I'm absorbing the training a lot better. So what happened, to answer your question, was my identity was all wrapped up in my performances. Ray, so n that's why i struggled with depression. As i looked in the mirror in the morning, i was struggling with my running. I was hurt. I was frustrated with how things were going. I wasn't getting better. And so i just saw myself as a failure. And is very difficult to have that happen every single morning, get up inthe mirror, failure. Failure. Failure. Failure, you know? And so when i went back home, like, my faith has always been a huge part of my life, and i i started to realize, like, i need to see myself how god sees me. And how god sees me has nothing to do with my performance. Rig. It's like, thinkn about like your kids, rightlik, you don't really care how good they are to certain sport, right? Like, you love them, right? It's unconditional who they are, ye. And so, like, can i love myself that same way, oftentimes? Like, we're able to love other people and treat other people a lot better than we actually treat ourself in our mind, you know?

	- It's Not Meant to Last Forever
	  
	  Summary:
	  "I savor every second of it. I talk a lot with my wife about that, cause she's 38, turnin 39 in april, and she's actually running the best stuff she's ever run still," he said. "That's what makes life so special, because it's not just going to go on forever."
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  Yes, absolutely.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I mant talk a lot with my wife about that, cause she's 38, turnin 39 in april, and she's actually running the best stuff she's ever run still, which is incredible, and i think speaks to like, wy women age bettertan men, in a lot of ways. But what was really pactful for me at the end of my career was this moment i was in a aeroplane, i was looking out over everything and just trying to get clarity about what was going on. Is beent through four years of massive struggle, right? And what i felt like just koind like having a little pray sesh with god. And what i felt like, what a sensing, is just this reminder that it's not meant to last forever. Cause i think, like your saying, peter, it's like, when you're in it, you feel like it is going to last forever, and it is supposed to last forever. But that's actually the, like, what makes life so beautiful, ray, is it like nothing lasts forever. Ray, that's like what makes the sunset so beautiful. It doesn't just stay in the for ever. Its what makes life so special, because it's not just going to go on forever. So having that moment of realization that this, it's ok for it to not last forever. It's ok that, like, that was my day, and i did, i savored it. For everything tis worth ray. And that's absolutely what i tell my athletes as well. I savor every second of it. But life is going to change. You're enter into new seasons. ([Time 1:36:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/544d87ba-6310-493a-9bc8-315d925fa065))
