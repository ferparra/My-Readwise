	- What is common in Fourier series and the Cartesian coordinate system?
	  
	  More than you think: they are (almost) the same.
	  
	  Let me explain why!

	- Let's start with the basics: the inner product.
	  
	  In the Euclidean plane, it can be calculated using the "magnitude x magnitude x cosine" formula, also known as the geometric definition.

	- Now, let's project x to y!
	  
	  With basic trigonometry, we can see that the inner product is related to the length of the projection.

	- If y is a unit vector, the inner product is precisely the length of the projection!
	  
	  Take note of this, as this is one of the foundations of modern mathematics.

	- Why is this good?
	  
	  Because we can decompose any vector in terms of an orthogonal system!

	- For example, this is what we do in physics to study a rectangular object sliding down a slope.

	- This process works in higher dimensional vector spaces as well.
	  
	  Meet orthonormal bases: sets of unit vectors that are
	- For instance, in n-dimensions, this is the standard orthonormal basis.

	- Why do we LOVE orthonormal bases?
	  
	  Because we don't have to solve linear equations to write a given vector in terms of the basis; simply taking the inner product is enough.

	- Orthonormal bases are also what's behind the Fourier series!
	  
	  Functions are vectors, and we can define the notion of orthogonality between them!

	- As the sine and cosine functions - together with their frequency-modulated counterparts - form an orthonormal basis in the so-called L2 space, we can write "every" periodic function as a linear combination of sines and cosines.

	- (There are lots of footnotes here. For instance, the equality above is not exactly the usual pointwise equality, but we'll let the technical details slide.
	  
	  For smooth enough functions, the Fourier expansion works without issues.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TivadarDanka/status/1603712623261863939))
	- As the inner product in L2 spaces is given by the integral, we can compute the Fourier coefficients easily.
