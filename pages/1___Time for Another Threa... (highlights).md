	- 1/Time for another thread! Today we will jump in and look at how currency pegs work, how they break and what lies ahead for the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) peg.
	  
	  Breaking pegs is one of the most exciting parts of speculating in currencies!
	  
	  Let's dive in! ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698090039844865))

	- 2/A peg is simply when a government or a central bank decides that the country's currency will trade at a specific exchange rate against a foreign currency (or basket of currencies).
	  
	  If the Bank of England decides that the GBP should trade at 1 GBP =1.20 USD, that is a peg! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698091046477824))
	- 3/Why do governments use pegs?
	  
	  Pegs tend to bring about (temporary) bouts of stability, especially in the middle of high inflation. A good example of this is Chile.
	  
	  In 1979, Chile decided to peg its currency at 39 pesos to 1 USD. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698092065611778))
	- 4/Inflation declined from 39% in 1979 to under 10% in 1981. In fact, Chile's wholesale price index went negative in 1981, to -4.8%, which was seriously deflationary.
	  
	  However a lot of this prosperity comes at a cost and the real exchange rate continued to rise. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698093101699086))
	- 5/When the real exchange rate is high, the price of goods at home is higher than the price of goods abroad. 
	  
	  This led to increased imports, and the trade deficit grew wider. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698094108229638))
	- 6/Not all was bad in Chile - banks and firms borrowed USD offshore and invested it in Chile due to the high interest rates there.
	  
	  This was good at the start as the USD reserves of Chile went up (investors exchanged their USD for Chilean Pesos). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698095127506945))
	- 7/All good, right? Not so quick. Private sector debt started to rise, and inevitably when USD reserves fell, the debt continued to rise. 
	  
	  This led unemployment to rise, and so did interest rates (to sustain the peso peg). This ended with an 18% devaluation in 1982. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698096142524422))
	- 8/The other very famous 'peg break' was that of the GBP against the Deutsche Mark - the famous Soros trade of Breaking the BoE.
	  
	  The GBP had been linked with the Mark in the European Rate Mechanism (ERM) - a pegging system. 
	  
	  The band was from 2.78DM= Â£1 to 2.95DM =Â£1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698097228849153))
	- 9/Germany was fighting inflation from the fall of the Berlin Wall, and so rates had risen. Meanwhile Britain was in a recession.
	  
	  The right policy for Britain was low rates (which put pressure on its currency), while that for Germany was high interest rates. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698098290012160))
	- 10/Britain had to either save its economy or it had to save the peg. The monetary policies of Britain and Germany were at loggerheads with each other.
	  
	  Britain tried defending the peg with Â£15B, but that did not suffice, and George Soros made a fortune. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698099296681987))
	- 11/What do we learn from the two examples of the Chilean Peso and the ERM?
	  
	  To sustain a peg, two conditions have to be true:
	  1. There needs to be coordination / similarity in monetary policy (interest rates)
	  2. You need the FX Reserves to defend it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698100416462850))
	- 12/You lose control over your monetary policy, when you have a peg. If Britain wanted to maintain the ERM, it would have to decide to keep the peg over helping its economy out of recession.
	  
	  No government would pick a peg over its own economy! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698101439975424))
	- 13/Britain dedicated only Â£15B worth in reserves (that's how much Soros alone shorted!) 
	  
	  Similarly, Chile ran out of USD reserves and thus had to devalue its currency.
	  
	  When USDs (foreign currency) start to get scarce, it gets very difficult for central banks to keep the peg. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698102488506369))
	- 14/What makes betting against pegs so attractive?
	  
	  Well, these are some of the most 'low risk high reward bets'. If the ERM peg was defended, Soros would lose the difference between 2.78DM and 2.95DM (~6% maximum).
	  
	  If he was right, he would make a killing. And he was right. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698103474110470))
	- 15/Now onto the case of the HKD peg. 
	  
	  Two of the biggest investors on FinTwit, @Jkylebass and @SantiagoAuFund have been bearish on the peg, and Kyle has started a fund dedicated to betting against the peg.
	  
	  So what's going on with the HKD? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698104531075072))
	- 16/Here's some backstory. 
	  
	  The HKD was pegged in Oct 1983, after 9 years of a floating exchange rate system, at HK$ 7.80=1 US$.
	  
	  See in 1983, China was a very different place. They were not very open, and investors remained skeptical. 
	  
	  HK was a British colony at the time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698105562963970))
	- 17/In September of 1983, there were talks between China and the UK of what would happen to HK after 1997.
	  
	  There was little confidence in these talks and the HKD fell 15% in 2 days to an all time low of HK$ 9.6 to 1 US$. 
	  
	  There were panics for food and 'Black Saturday' happened. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698106594734081))
	- 18/So there was a shift back to the old system of pegging. 
	  
	  This system has remained quite resilient throughout history, and even stopped collapsing under the weight of the legendary George Soros in 1997.
	  
	  The peg now trades between HK$7.75 to the USD and HK$7.85 to the USD.

	- 19/When investors buy lots of HKD, the exchange rate rises to the HK$7.75 level. The HKMA (their monetary authority) steps in and sells HKD and buys USD.
	  
	  This supply of HKD goes up and interest rates decline in HK. The opposite happens when investors sell lots of HKD. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698111724408834))
	- 20/As we discussed earlier in the thread, pegs stop you from deciding monetary policy and demand sufficient FX reserves.
	  
	  Hong Kong has historically suffered from the first problem - that of not having control over its monetary policy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698112718417920))
	- 21/During the Asian Financial Crisis, while Thailand and Malaysia saw their pegs destroyed, Hong Kong didn't.
	  
	  Hong Kong had to raise its interbank rate higher to stop the outflow of capital, that could potentially break the peg, and rates rose: 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2koj_7WEAAmZEr.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698115121696769))
	- 22/However what about the second condition of USD reserves?
	  
	  This is where I disagree with @Jkylebass and @SantiagoAuFund on their thesis.
	  
	  If the central bank can keep purchasing additional amounts of their currency, the peg can be sustained. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698117004943366))
	- 23/The Hong Kong Monetary Authority reported in October 2020 that they had roughly US$453.3B in FX reserves.
	  
	  This amounts to over 6x their currency in circulation. Theoretically, if someone shorted all HKD in circulation 6 TIMES, the HKMA could defend it and have $ left over. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698118032543747))
	- 24/Now of course, in general, these numbers might be overstated or fraudulent. 
	  
	  The increasing intervention of the CPC in China along with various protests, property prices and potential outflows of capital from HKMA are risks to the peg. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698119076982785))
	- 25/Shorting the HKD peg has historically been a 'widow maker' trade, with even Soros admitting that the HKMA did a good job.
	  
	  Many traders have been short the peg, frustrated that the trade went nowhere, and went elsewhere to allocate their capital. 
	  
	  Will it break? We will see. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698120184225805))
	- 26/If you've read all the way till the end, thank you so much for reading! I would really request you like / retweet / follow if you liked the thread!
	  
	  Once again thank you for reading - means a lot to me! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elite_investor/status/1398698173418426368))
