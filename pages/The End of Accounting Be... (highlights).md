	- 1c/ Investors Barely Use Financial Reports
	  
	  Here's a wild stat from the book ... 
	  
	  Financial accounting reports contribute ~5% to an investor's final decision-making process. 
	  
	  What leads?
	  
	  â€¢ Nonaccounting SEC filings
	  
	  â€¢ Analyst recommendations 
	  
	  Reading 10Ks is an edge ...?

	- 2/ How Accounting Information Lost It's Relevance
	  
	  The book highlights three main culprits for Accounting's Irrelevance: 
	  
	  â€¢ Treatment of Intangible Assets
	  
	  â€¢ Substituting Estimates For Facts
	  
	  â€¢ Unrecorded Events That Affect Corporate Value
	  
	  Let's dive into each of them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/marketplunger1/status/1638213024119939073))
	- 2a/ Treatment of Intanible Assets
	  
	  Michael Mauboussin (@mjmauboussin) has written extensively on this, but let's keep it simple.
	  
	  If you buy a brand, it's an asset on the BS. 
	  
	  If you internally develop that brand, it's 100% expensed through the income statement. 
	  
	  Interesting...

	- 2b/ Substituting Estimates For Facts
	  
	  Investors love certainty because it fits in their Excel spreadsheets.
	  
	  But the reality is most of the line-tems are estimates.
	  
	  Then there's increasing number of "special" items.

	- 2c/ Unrecorded Events That Affect Corporate Value
	  
	  Accounting reports are great at documenting real-time cash impacts.
	  
	  But they don't show the value of things like: 
	  
	  â€¢ Missed/passed drug trials
	  
	  â€¢ Loss of major contract
	  
	  â€¢ Loss of key talent
	  
	  Creates huge lag in reporting.

	- 3/ How To Fix: Strategic Resources & Consequences Report
	  
	  This report has five attributes: 
	  
	  â€¢ Strategic resources (assets)
	  
	  â€¢ Investments (expenditures)
	  
	  â€¢ Major risks
	  
	  â€¢ Deployment of resources
	  
	  â€¢ Quantify consequences (value creation)

	- 4/ Recap: Make Accounting Info Relevant Again
	  
	  Here are a few takeaways from the book:
	  
	  â€¢ Most investors favor estimates & analysts recommendations over financial analysis
	  
	  â€¢ GAAP accounting is pretty outdated
	  
	  â€¢ Strategic Resources & Consequence Reports help relevance. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/marketplunger1/status/1638213098644316163))
