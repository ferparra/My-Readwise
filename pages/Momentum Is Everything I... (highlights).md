	- Momentum is everything in startups. 
	  
	  Mometum -> More capital+talent -> Solve more problems -> More momentum. ➰
	  
	  But there is a canyon 🏔 in startups going from traction -> growth that is getting wider.

	- What got you to traction won't get you to compounding growth. That's what creates the canyon.  There are 4 problems founders need to anticipate and solve.  Let's go through them 1 by 1... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbalfour/status/1430573944403156995))
	- Problem 1: Linear Tactics -> Compounding Growth Engine
	  
	  Most startups get traction by executing what we call linear tactics in @reforge. As startups need more growth, the biggest mistake is just trying to execute more linear tactics. This doesn't work for three reasons... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbalfour/status/1430573945959247877))
	- 1. Each one has a low ceiling.
	  2. Each has a fixed cost of time. You spread the peanut butter too thin.
	  3. Most linear tactics aren't repeatable over the long term. 
	  
	  You have to instead build an engine with a growth loop at the center: https://t.co/Lf1YXaxFQ6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbalfour/status/1430573947565731918))
	- Problem 2: PM Fit -> 4 Fits
	  
	  Traction ≠ Product Market Fit.  Good explanation by @ibringtraffic 
	  
	  "Startups confuse a successful linear tactic with achieving PMF. It can lead to a false signal of success" 
	  
	  Instead, startups need to understand 3 things... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbalfour/status/1430573949121810442))
	- 1. Do you truly have PMF?
	  2. With what size market do you have PMF with?
	  3. What is the strength of that PMF? (it's not binary)
	  
	  Answering these q's requires founders to start thinking beyond product-market fit, and thinking about the four fits -> https://t.co/b9YTG0cOGW ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbalfour/status/1430573950765920257))
	- Problem #3: Early Adopters -> Adjacent Users
	  
	  Around this time you start running into adjacent users. 
	  
	  Ready The Adjacent User Theory by @iambangaly to understand this better: 
	  
	  https://t.co/B1KtGbYedz ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbalfour/status/1430573952552767490))
	- The impact of the adjacent user is a decline in your acquisition, retention and monetization metrics. It takes more effort and more work just to maintain your momentum. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbalfour/status/1430573954192666625))
	- Problem #4: Scrappy Generalists -> Specialized Strategists+Executors
	  
	  You typically need people that can both set the strategy, and execute some tactics.  Too tactical, you never hit a growth engine.  Too strategic, you don't execute.
	  
	  Finding this in 1 person is very difficult. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbalfour/status/1430573955719385091))
	- Now comes the fun part.  The Momentum Canyon is getting WIDER.  
	  
	  There are 4 reasons for this... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbalfour/status/1430573957279715332))
	- Reason #1: More Capital = More Well Funded Competition
	  
	  @ttunguz has some good data about this in these posts:

	- Reason #2: Scalable Channels Haven't Increased At The Same Rate As Capital 
	  
	  All that capital needs to go somewhere. The # of scalable channels to invest this money has not increased at the same rate. 
	  
	  This is clearest in FB's latest numbers where CPC's have 📈 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbalfour/status/1430573963114024960))
	- Reason #3: The Privacy Movement
	  
	  Lots of good things coming out of the privacy movement.  I'm not going to debate good/bad.  Just here to make the point it makes it harder to efficiently/effectively target your audience. 
	  
	  @eric_seufert has a good 🧵 here: https://t.co/ANZt4Jc8FW ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbalfour/status/1430573964623970308))
	- Reason #4: Bottoms Up Low Hanging Fruit Is Gone
	  
	  The SaaS world has benefited from a boom in bottoms up growth models driven by taking existing categories and reducing adoption friction.  That low-hanging fruit is picked pretty clean.  Every category is highly competitive. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbalfour/status/1430573966419058691))
	- So to recap...
	  
	  1. Momentum is everything. 
	  2. There is a momentum canyon traction to growth. 
	  3. That canyon is getting wider. 
	  
	  Here is the most important point.  Founders, YOU own this problem. Company Strategy = Growth Strategy at this stage.  You can't "outsource" it... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bbalfour/status/1430573968134529024))
	- ...your growth strategy informs: 
	  
	  The metrics you use to guide your business.
	  
	  The goals you set for the team.
	  
	  How you organize and align your teams.
	  
	  How you should think about competitors.
	  
	  How much money you should raise and when.
	  
	  How you should deploy that capital.

	- This is why we created the @reforge Growth for Founders Program to help founders cross the momentum canyon.
