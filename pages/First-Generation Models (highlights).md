	- OpenAI’s text embeddings measure the relatedness of text strings. Embeddings are commonly used for:
	  
	  •   **Search** (where results are ranked by relevance to a query string)
	  •   **Clustering** (where text strings are grouped by similarity)
	  •   **Recommendations** (where items with related text strings are recommended)
	  •   **Anomaly detection** (where outliers with little relatedness are identified)
	  •   **Diversity measurement** (where similarity distributions are analyzed)
	  •   **Classification** (where text strings are classified by their most similar label) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwxwyttnb4eaecr2hxg60a7))
