- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- Last week, @lennysan asked his readers, "What’s your team’s communication rhythm?"
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Currently, we're 10 at Optemization. Remote-first and async.
	- Internally, I spend 2.5 hours on meetings each week:
	  
	  1. Marketing Meeting (1hr)
	  • Performance: newsletter and social stats
	  • Pipeline: Content drafts, ideas, and discussions
	  
	  • Agenda in Notion automatically shows current content projects and notes.

	- 2. Team Meeting (1hr)
	  • Theme: each meeting has a film/tv related angle
	  • Ice breakers: everyone shares a fun fact
	  • Threads: review long-form actionable memos
	  • Open mic: any topic that needs collective attention
	  
	  • Agenda in Notion automatically pulls current Threads

	- 3. Exec Sync - 30mins (1hr)
	  • Free-form, what's important in our minds
	  
	  Every month and every quarter we review performance and OKRs based on a Notion template.

	- The "Threads" database has grown to be a key part of our operations and communication.
	  
	  Slack is great but communication is lost quickly. 
	  
	  In Threads, we write memos that are inherently actionable.
	  
	  We use it to set OKRs, share OOOs, and showcase major initiatives — all async!

	- For example, here's a thread about our August performance.
	  
	  It's nothing complex.
	  
	  However, the important part is that it's actionable.
	  
	  It's connected to our Tasks database, so the required engagement is organized for everyone.
	  
	  It's scarily easy to lose track of that in Slack.
