	- Quantitative Models of the Social World
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Precise quantitative models are important for understanding social dynamics, but they need to be supplemented with more ambiguous verbal conversations., * There are lots of smart people working on these models, and I'm optimistic that in the next few decades we'll be able to understand social dynamics better.)

	  Speaker 1
	  Well for a show that's supposedly intended to sing the praises of an institution committed to parsimonious quantitative models I hope this episode doesn't get me canned but I think that this is the fray at the edge of the weave of the scientific enterprise and as such it is precisely what keeps people motivated to continue doing research whether that research be quantitative or otherwise I think that actually myself and others a lot of people are working on precise quantitative models about these kind of big picture social dynamics the thing is that it's very hard and I think that having these more ambiguous verbal conversations are really important for grounding and figuring out what's important to build into the are more formal models and I think that the back and forth right you can't only be precise and quantitative this gets back to what we were talking About earlier you also have to be vague and ambiguous especially when you don't know exactly what you're talking about but that may help us kind of circle back in on the more quantitative aspects the things that we really care about and to try to build models that capture some of those things and it's going to take lots of families of models and different perspectives and things but I think that increasingly there are really smart people from different fields talking to each other to try to get at quantitative descriptions of the social world and I'm optimistic that in the next few decades there's going to be some really really cool advances in our understanding of these kinds of things.
