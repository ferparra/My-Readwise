	- Quantitative Models of the Social World
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Precise quantitative models are important for understanding social dynamics, but they need to be supplemented with more ambiguous verbal conversations., * There are lots of smart people working on these models, and I'm optimistic that in the next few decades we'll be able to understand social dynamics better.)

	  Well for a show that's supposedly intended to sing the praises of an institution committed to parsimonious quantitative models I hope this episode doesn't get me canned but I think that this is the fray at the edge of the weave of the scientific enterprise and as such it is precisely what keeps people motivated to continue doing research whether that research be quantitative or otherwise I think that actually myself and others a lot of people are working on precise quantitative models about these kind of big picture social dynamics the thing is that it's very hard and I think that having these more ambiguous verbal conversations are really important for grounding and figuring out what's important to build into the are more formal models and I think that the back and forth right you can't only be precise and quantitative this gets back to what we were talking About earlier you also have to be vague and ambiguous especially when you don't know exactly what you're talking about but that may help us kind of circle back in on the more quantitative aspects the things that we really care about and to try to build models that capture some of those things and it's going to take lots of families of models and different perspectives and things but I think that increasingly there are really smart people from different fields talking to each other to try to get at quantitative descriptions of the social world and I'm optimistic that in the next few decades there's going to be some really really cool advances in our understanding of these kinds of things.

	- The Role of Simplification in Perverse Incentives
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Perverse incentives and value capture are two sides of the same coin, and they are both ways in which the world can take over what we care about., * The philosopher here is best suited to study changes in behavior and outcomes as a result of perverse incentives.)

	  There's a really interesting gap here, because an interesting thing for us to talk is that you're really interested in the stuff that's on the outside, the perverse incentives. And I'm really interested in the things that are on the inside, the ways that people change their value. In the background for the listeners, Paul read a paper of mine that's in draft called value capture, and value capture is when the world presents us with external simplified versions of our values, and they swamp our system, they take over what we value. I just want to start by saying, I think there's something really different between perverse incentives and value capture, because you can be perversely incentive incentivized without changing what you deeply care about, right? So if I'm a philosopher and I care about wisdom, and the world is handing me the incentive to write shitty, stupid papers on poppy topics, I might still hang on to what I care about, but I know in order to make money and survive professionally, I have to pursue this other stuff. That's enough to have a perverse incentive. And I kind of think that people like you are the best people to study perverse incentives, because you're studying the changes in the way people behave, and the changes in outcomes. Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like the weird thing that the philosopher here is caring about is what happens to our souls when that swamps. How do we change in a deep way when we are not merely incentivized, but when our core values are captured by these simplified metrics?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Oh, so I think that's a really interesting take. I hear what you're saying, and I think your characterization of perverse incentives is the way that it's usually talked about. I think the way I think about these things is that these two things are basically the same. And I think it's partly because I think about ([Time 0:07:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7962c917-76ad-4c5a-a6a3-93f2bc4b32d4))
