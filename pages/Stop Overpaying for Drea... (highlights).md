	- 7/ We're running!
	  
	  Now decide what you want to train. Here we will select a person. Choose which base model you want to use.
	  
	  Upload the photos for training (ex. 8 photos of yourself). Make sure all images are 512x512.
	  
	  Now assign a token name, use something unique like "tstr1".

	- 8/ We can see the estimate, cheaper than 50 cents!
	  
	  Beginners: I do not recommend messing with custom settings.
	  
	  Make sure to check the "remove GPU". This makes sure you aren't charged after training.
	  
	  Name your model, save to profile, add your HF write token, and start training.

	- 9/ Time for a walk! Training can take anywhere from 20 minutes to hours depending on the image data set. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/angrypenguinPNG/status/1599611967534088194))

	  Now you can get to experimenting! All for cheaper than a $1!!
	  
	  Compare that to the $10+ that Dreambooth services charge per model üò± ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/angrypenguinPNG/status/1599611982591639552))
