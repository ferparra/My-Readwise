	- Iâ€™ve been using Tailwind to build a new landing page for Parcel 2 lately. Really enjoying it! ðŸ¤©
	  
	  I think whatâ€™s most under-appreciated by critics is that itâ€™s not just a 1:1 mapping of classes to CSS properties. It helps you create better designs more quickly! ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1391157748599951360))

	- As a non-designer, choosing colors is the hardest part of creating a website for me. Tailwind includes an expertly crafted color system by default, so you donâ€™t need to spend time choosing your own colors if you donâ€™t want to. If you do, you can override everything.

	- Same goes for sizing, spacing, rounded corners, typography, etc. Itâ€™s not just another syntax for CSS, it helps enforce design consistency. 
	  
	  Itâ€™s like CSS, but you can only use pre-defined variables. Constraints are a good thing! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1391157750760034306))
	- Sure, the syntax has a bit of a learning curve, and I didnâ€™t like it at first. But itâ€™s quick to get used to and the VSCode plugin is incredible. Iâ€™ve definitely been able to build things much faster than I would from scratch.
	  
	  If you havenâ€™t yet, I recommend giving it a try! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1391157751816982529))
