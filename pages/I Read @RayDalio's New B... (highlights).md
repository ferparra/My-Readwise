	- I read @RayDalio's new book, “The Changing World Order” 
	  
	  in which he claims the US “empire” is in its final stages of decline
	  
	  Interesting, but with all due respect, he’s wrong.
	  
	  Here’s why 👇 (long thread 🧵 )

		- **Note**: Thread
	- @RayDalio 1/
	  Dalio's theory falls in the typical Malthusian fallacy trap:
	  
	  it juxtaposes linear resource production with exponential debt creation (private & public sector overleveraging)
	  
	  and concludes that this cannot last.
	  
	  Just like it failed to last in the past for other Empires. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378144548352001))
	- @RayDalio 2/ 
	  This, btw, is not a new theory.
	  
	  Many empire-desolation theories claim that Empires reach their zenith when corruption, overleveraging and/or inflation lead to societal decay.
	  
	  This then sets the stage for decline.
	  
	  The Empire becomes vulnerable to inside & outside shocks ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378147157200897))
	- @RayDalio 3/
	  However, what such Malthusian fallacy theories neglect is the impact of rapid technological innovation
	  
	  (of which the US is a world leader)
	  
	  and entrepreneurial trial and error
	  
	  (another US stronghold)
	  
	  which typically create resource abundance. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378149900279810))
	- @RayDalio 4/ 
	  Neither of these - tech innovation or trial-&-error - 
	  
	  were present in previous Empires to the extent they are present in modern-day United States
	  
	  Previous Empires that Dalio analyzes (and many others that he doesn't) all grew mostly on monopoly power and state conquest. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378152513417216))
	- @RayDalio 5/ 
	  There's a reason why the US stock mkt has a positive secular trend
	  
	  Its firms are attracting investors worldwide, more than any other market in history. Why?
	  
	  Innovation and trial-&-error that create industrial giants
	  
	  (+monopoly power and political protection every now&then) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378155222913024))
	- @RayDalio 6/
	  What’s hurting the US today is not its model of capitalism based on debt,
	  
	  nor its political polarization, class discrimination or inequality. 
	  
	  These were present in several other times in their history. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378157810823168))
	- @RayDalio 7/ 
	  What’s hurting it today is a system of corporate political capture,
	  
	  that's lowering inter-generational mobility, and exacerbating the inequality problem. 
	  
	  But this too happened before at certain points in time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378160335687682))
	- @RayDalio 8/
	  It hurt the system, but it did not destroy it.
	  
	  Why? Because the US is a politically inclusive open-access society,
	  
	  with strong entrepreneurial dynamism and trial-and-error democracy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378163032621056))
	- @RayDalio 9/ 
	  And that works better than any top-down system that attempts to kick-start economic growth via massive resource redistribution.
	  
	  It works only until a certain level, after which the lack of inclusiveness and lack of trial&error lead to social decay ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378165649874944))
	- @RayDalio 10/
	  My point is that Dalio, and similar theories, are focusing on the wrong indicators
	  
	  They are seeing discord and destruction in open democracies
	  
	  but democracies persist BECAUSE of this discord and instability ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378168271310849))
	- @RayDalio 11/
	  Discord and instability
	  
	  (like discrimination, inequality, lack of mobility, cronyism, corporate capture)
	  
	  are all *temporary* errors
	  
	  which, within open-access societies,
	  
	  attract innovative solutions to solve them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378170875969536))
	- @RayDalio 12/
	  E.g. Climate change is a hot global issue rn
	  
	  There are so many powerful initiatives + social pressures,
	  
	  in addition to policies being implemented, 
	  
	  that are determined on solving this issue.
	  
	  Never underestimate the innovative capacity of open-access orders. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378173577129985))
	- @RayDalio 13/
	  Top-down, closed-access, centralized systems with bloated bureaucracies,
	  
	  will *never* provide such solutions.
	  
	  Why?
	  
	  because they lack the creative trial-and-error capacity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378176097882112))
	- @RayDalio 14/
	  Furthermore,
	  
	  If corruption, cronyism and having an overleveraged financial sector is a problem for a declining Empire like the US,
	  
	  then China, suffering from each of these (hint: Evergrande)
	  
	  will hardly overtake the US as the next globally-dominant “Empire” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378179583352832))
	- @RayDalio 15/
	  Also, people taking about China seldom understand their drivers - they are not the same as those of the West.
	  
	  For China, during its 5000 year (!) history
	  
	  it was always, ALWAYS, about inward perfection.
	  
	  Inward perfection >> outward conquest. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378182099955712))
	- @RayDalio 16/
	  As a side note, check out Zheng He's 15th century ship compared to that of Columbus. It was bigger and much more advanced.
	  
	  Yet China never used that tech capacity for conquest and int’l domination. Like the West has. 
	  
	  It will remain focused more inward than outward.

	- @RayDalio 17/
	  We do have a multi-polar world, and Asian countries are finally living up to the standard.
	  
	  And that's a great thing!
	  
	  Much better than the Cold War era
	  
	  Trade with Asian countries made everyone - on aggregate - better off ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378194624204801))
	- @RayDalio 18/
	  It’s not about China overpowering the US to become the next global superpower
	  
	  It already *is* an economic superpower
	  
	  There doesn’t have to be only one.
	  
	  This is not Game of Thrones. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378197207834625))
	- @RayDalio 19/
	  The world is much more complex than that.
	  
	  Just because the US won’t be the biggest global trade player
	  
	  doesn’t mean it will perish or lose its int’l dominance
	  
	  Even if it does, it won’t end in revolutions and discord
	  
	  After all, neither did the British empire! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378199829258240))
	- @RayDalio 20/
	  The British empire dissolved b/c their army strength was overpowered by the Germans
	  
	  No country is even close to challenging the US in military power or funding
	  
	  Also, back then you could wage wars if you developed superior technology... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378202442346496))
	- @RayDalio 21/
	   (like Britain did against Holland or Spain in 16th cent, or Germany against Britain in 20th cent)
	  
	  But waging war to weaken the US in the nuclear age is inconceivable
	  
	  Just like the US will never attack another nuclear power - Cold War game theory logic still works ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378204992442368))
	- @RayDalio 22/
	  The US will therefore NOT be weaker.
	  
	  Its importance may drop relative to other ascending countries, but it’s innovation and trial-and-error mentality 
	  
	  combined with its state-of-the-art universities will ensure that it remains the global leader in innovation ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378207555244032))
	- @RayDalio 23/
	  What Dalio’s theory
	  
	  and all other Malthusian-based theories predicting the decline of the US empire
	  
	  are missing is the fact that success of a nation is driven by: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378210193485824))
	- @RayDalio 24/
	  
	  1) An open-access order (North-Wallis-Weingast argument)
	  
	  2) A politically inclusive society (Acemoglu-Robinson argument)
	  
	  3) A disruptively innovative society (Schumpeterian argument)
	  
	  4) A trial-and-error democracy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378212814819328))
	- @RayDalio 25/ 
	  An Empire’s true strength is measured by its robustness to shocks
	  
	  like military or terrorist attacks, or economic crises.
	  
	  The US withheld these shocks quite successfully thus far ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378215440470016))
	- @RayDalio 26/
	  [[The Great Depression]] and the Great Recession were the biggest threats to Western model of capitalist [[democracy]]
	  
	  Both produced alternatives: the first gave rise to national-[[socialism]] and [[communism]]
	  
	  The second gave rise to state capitalism ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378217969725441))
	- @RayDalio 27/ 
	  None of these alternatives have what it takes to overthrow a capitalist democracy: 
	  
	  persistent innovation through trial and error
	  
	  Trial-and-error helps a falling empire (or society) consolidate and fix itself from within
	  
	  Like it did in late 19th century US ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378220545028096))

	  The same with worker rights
	  
	  or women’s rights
	  
	  or black rights
	  
	  or gay rights
	  
	  they were all fought for and achieved within an open and inclusive democracy.
	  
	  Greater human rights have almost never been achieved under autocratic or semi-autocratic regimes ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378223078277120))

	  The main problem when you use [[history]] and [[macro]] theory to make [[inferences]]/[[predictions]] about the future is that both are falsifiable
	  
	  You cannot prove many [[causal relationships]] in [[macro]] or in [[history]]. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378235870908416))
	- @RayDalio @nfergus @peterfrankopan @nntaleb 34/
	  You can use natural experiments in history to make causal inferences about specific situations
	  
	  But you can seldom generalize them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378238442041344))
	- @RayDalio @nfergus @peterfrankopan @nntaleb 35/
	  e.g., a natural experiment in history was when Napoleon was conquering Europe, specifically German city states.
	  
	  Areas where Napoleon implemented his reforms (Code Civil, abolishing guilds, lowering the power of the Church, etc.) ... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378241176702978))

	  ...had much better economic outcomes 100 years later compared to similar neighboring areas where Napoleon didn’t implement these reforms
	  
	  That’s a natural experiment of history. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378243915689984))
	- @RayDalio @nfergus @peterfrankopan @nntaleb 37/
	  Another example was the African slave trade
	  
	  Areas with more coastal exposure have worse economic outcomes than similar areas without coastal exposure.
	  
	  Why? 
	  
	  Western expropriators enslaved more people from areas where it was easier to transfer them to a boat. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378246478319616))
	- @RayDalio @nfergus @peterfrankopan @nntaleb 38/
	  Any grand conclusions made by comparing relative levels of GDP through time, cross-country are likely to be dead wrong.

	  In conclusion,
	  
	  Dalio gives a very interesting historical overview of many past and current empires.
	  
	  But does NOT provide a working theory on why nations fail. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378251742236673))
	- @RayDalio @nfergus @peterfrankopan @nntaleb 40/
	  His theory carries zero causal implications,
	  
	  what he sees in the US today is exactly what we’ve seen there in the late 19th century (robber barons), the 1920s or the 1960s, 
	  
	  periods after which the US underwent massive economic expansion ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378254451757057))
	- @RayDalio @nfergus @peterfrankopan @nntaleb 41/
	  Driven by debt, yes, but debt that was financing innovation and entrepreneurial spirit
	  
	  Also, the same overleveraging issues he sees in the US are present in China.
	  
	  They're just hidden a bit better.
	  
	  Which doesn’t mean China will fail. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378256993505280))
	- @RayDalio @nfergus @peterfrankopan @nntaleb 42/
	  Nor does it imply it will become the dominant single global superpower (like the US overtaking the British Empire)
	  
	  China will continue its ascent and increase its importance. 
	  
	  But it’s downfall, if it happens, will not be due to debt-induced cycles ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wolf_vukovic/status/1540378259560378368))
	- @RayDalio @nfergus @peterfrankopan @nntaleb 43/
	  It will be due to internal political pressures.
	  
	  If they become more open
