	- My favs from @lesswrong's 100 tips for a better life:
	  
	  1)  Success 💫
	  
	  • The best advice is personal/comes from somebody who knows you well
	  
	  • How you spend your days is how you spend your life 
	  
	  • Discipline > motivation. The former can be trained, the latter is fleeting
	- 2) Cooking 🍵
	  
	  • Steeping minutes: Green at 3, black at 4, herbal at 5. 
	  
	  • When googling a recipe, precede it with ‘best’. You’ll find better recipes. 
	  
	  • Food taste can be made much more exciting through simple seasoning.
	- 3) Productivity ☕️
	  
	  • You can automate mundane computer tasks with Autohotkey (or AppleScript).
	  
	  • Reward yourself after completing challenges, even badly. 
	  
	  • Keep your desk and workspace bare. Treat every object as an imposition upon your attention, because it is.
	- 4) Body 💪🏻
	  
	  • The 20/20/20 rule: Every 20 mins of screenwork, look at a spot 20 feet away for 20 secs
	  
	  • Exercise (weightlifting) not only creates muscle mass, it also improves skeletal structure.
	  
	  • Don’t waste $ on multivitamins, they don’t work.  However, vitamin D works.
	- 5) Possessions 🪑
	  
	  • Things you use for a significant fraction of your life (bed: 1/3rd, office-chair: 1/4th) are worth investing in. 
	  
	  • When buying things, time and money trade-off against each other.
	- 6) Rationality 🧠
	  
	  • Noticing biases in others is easy, noticing biases in yourself is hard. However, it has much higher pay-off. 
	  
	  • Often in the process of laying out a problem, a solution will present itself. 
	  
	  • Whenever you receive advice, consider its opposite as well.
	- 7) Self 🧘🏻‍♀️
	  
	  • There's no interpersonal situation that can’t be improved by knowing more about yourself.
	  
	  • Sometimes unsolvable questions like “what is my purpose? lose their force upon lifestyle fixes. In other words, seeing friends regularly and getting enough sleep.
	- 8) Hazards ⚠️
	  
	  • There are 2 red flags to avoid almost all dangerous people: 1. The perpetually aggrieved ; 2. The angry. 
	  
	  • Those who generate anxiety in you and promise they have the solution are grifters. See: politicians, marketers, new masculinity gurus, etc. Avoid these
	- 9) Relationships 👯‍♀️
	  
	  • Look for somebody you enjoy just hanging with. Long-term relationships are mostly spent just chilling
	  
	  • De-emphasizing your quirks lead to 90% of people thinking you’re alright. Emphasizing them lead to 10% of ppl thinking you’re amazing. Aim for them
	- 10) Compassion ♥️
	  
	  • Call your parents when you think of them, tell your friends when you love them.
	  
	  • If somebody is undergoing group criticism, the tribal part in you will want to join in the fun of destroying somebody. Resist this, you’ll only add ugliness to the world.
	- 11) Joy ✨
	  
	  • Human mood and well-being are heavily influenced by simple things: Exercise, good sleep, light, being in nature. It’s cheap to experiment with these.
	  
	  • Endeavour to keep track of the good things to avoid an inaccurate and dismal view of the world.
