	  And then the point is, most of us haven't been taught to trun in on that level. You know, im, i dance angentin tango. And the fascinating thing about that is that for the first three s its, argentine tank was very difficult. It's a nerde dance basely and er. For the first three years, i sort of thought i was learning it. And then one night a stranger came and i started dancing with him, and he broke all the rules. You're not supposed to do this. He stopped in the middle of the floor and he said, what are you do? I said, this is incredibly rude. I said, i'm dancing tint. I go with you i said, no, you're not. I said, i'm sorry. Said, you're not. You're in your head, predicting what you think i'm going to ask you to do and doing the steps in your head. I said, ah, is it? You're not with me i said, oh. He said, forget all the steps in your head. Just feel the movement in my body. Feel the momentum. Listen to the music and the beat. Feel it. Let the dance do you. Oh, my god. So tango changed that night into something totally different and magical and i became aware of what was going on on a whole different level.
