	- #3. Absolute Position 
	  
	  Give some child objects the ability to defy auto layout. These objects can be placed anywhere and will use constraints instead. This is perfect for little rule breakers like notification badges, close icons, or tooltip pointers.. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/molly_hellmuth/status/1527663602483843072))

	  Set the spacing between child objects to a negative number. Allowing them to overlap with each other. This is perfect for “stacks” of avatars or cards.. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/molly_hellmuth/status/1527663616836648960))
