	- How to create a new trend in data?
	  
	  It's just 3 steps:
	  
	  1. Take a concept from Software Engineering
	  2. Replace "Software" with "Data"
	  3. Tell people why it's innovative and important
	  
	  That's it!
	  
	  Let's try to "coin" some badass new terms together for fun
	  
	  I'll start ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anna__geller/status/1575126943086694400))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ Continuous Data Integration
	  
	  This might be essentially CDC or streaming, but we could tell everyone it's a brand new concept and that it's the panacea to all ETL/ELT problems.
	  
	  (We might be too late for this one, though: https://t.co/ipwE16IMhs) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anna__geller/status/1575126945691357184))
	- 2/ Continuous Data Transformation
	  
	  This could really just be running incremental dbt models any time new data streams arrive. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anna__geller/status/1575126948455407617))
	- 3/ Data Cloud IDE = DCIDE could be pronounced as "decide" ðŸ”¥
	  
	  It could work like AWS Cloud 9 or GitHub Codespaces for working with data. A Cloud IDE, like dbt Cloud, but you could use it with any language (Python, R, SQL, ...) and any Cloud data warehouse. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anna__geller/status/1575126950925938689))
	- 4/ Data Environment
	  
	  This might refer to a temp environment that would get built as part of GitHub Actions to run tests before your data pipelines get deployed to production. Perhaps a throw-away Snowflake schema? dbt might be already doing this, but did they "coin" the term? ðŸ™ƒ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anna__geller/status/1575126953480183811))
	- Who knows, maybe someone will read this thread and use it as inspiration for yet another data tool or concept.
	  
	  Data Cloud IDE sounds fun, though.
	  
	  And ofc, this is all a bit sarcastic, but naming things right (incl. data concepts/trends/tool) is hard https://t.co/GiBoW4lBZV ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anna__geller/status/1575126956093210624))
