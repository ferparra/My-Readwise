	- And the first [[Path to Power User]] query workshop is done! Some thoughts: üëáÔ∏èüßµÔ∏è

	- You need to understand how pages are connected together in order to understand what the results of a query or linked reference filter will be. This seemed to be the most powerful thing people learned: how Roam recognizes connections. Look at the results of this query: https://t.co/TcM23EX8rO
	- Seriously, none of the popular material I've seen online for Roam explicitly addresses how indentation within a block hierarchy works to say "[[page 1]] is related to [[page 2]]." Some rules of thumb:

	- People also benefitted from the idea of queries as custom views of your data. It's like creating saved views of a database in Notion, except you don't have to structure every page you have into metadata. Connections come from indentation, not rigid columns https://t.co/O6hqxR3oMz https://t.co/nA74vdHu7K
	- I could have had a clearer structure. A lesson plan with course materials that people could copy in from a public database. I jumped around a bit. Asides were of varying usefulness. Here's a fun one - Try filtering unlinked refs for anything. Here I'm pulling in websites. https://t.co/qPCDs3kT3t
	- I like doing live events, so an alt structure here is that I could create a package of instructional materials that people can purchase on their own, and then have a live event to discuss those materials. More of a flipped classroom approach. I like specific subjects over courses
	- There were some technical difficulties. Breakout rooms, some issues with the size of text on the screen, etc. In the future, I'll use a CSS that's closer to vanilla. These should be easy enough to resolve for future workshops.
	- For those who weren't able to make it live, you'll receive the recording in the next week! I may want to edit and reshoot a few parts of it for clearness sake and not making people rewatch technical difficulties. "Little rough around the edges" lol yup https://t.co/qjaIXyUo28
	- Overall, I'm happy with how this went! I wasn't expecting nearly as many participants as I ended up with so it wasn't the "small experiment" I had in mind. I'll be making new workshops and adjusting the query one to do again with what I've learned from this experience.
