	  One of the ways it kept a budget, because as Ian's pointed out, it's mythical that it overran its budget, and that Wells was undisciplined in bikuni-ray matters, because actually it was fairly well kept. One of the ways it did that was through set design and through the very clever reuse of all kinds of sets from other productions at RKO. So when you're seeing Xanadu, and you often, if you look closely, you'll see that sort of towards the back of the scene, there'll certainly be a bunch of drapes, or it'll sort of just, the image kind of goes into a kind of unreadable obscurity. And that's where there's just this kind of clever use of cinematography and a reuse of props and sets that allows for it to mount this image of scale that didn't actually exist.

	  And that was the one thing that Wells hadn't had experience of doing, because if you look at the pictures of his famous productions, they're really quite sort of monumental. They're spectacular theatre in the 30s style, they're not full of detail. And this was new, he had to fill the frame with detail, and my goodness, he does fill the frame with detail. This is what makes the film so fascinating. To see it on a big screen is to really appreciate that fantastic sort of fetishistic preoccupation with decor. The decor is telling us what is happening to Kay in every stage in the film.
