	- Think like an engineer
	  A lot of edge cases appear when one finally sits down to write code — but that doesn’t have to be the case. If you think through what it will take to build it, you’ll address them early (e.g., does live chat work on mobile?).
	- Stay ahead of your dev team
	  A completed spec is one that has been reviewed and generally agreed upon. If you’re hoping to slot in work into a future sprint, make sure you start this process 2–3 weeks before.
