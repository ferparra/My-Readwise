	- 1/5 My feed is flooded by people who don't understand what "odds" mean. Seeing lot of takes about "prediction markets were wrong" "polls were wrong".
	  
	  I am going to insult my followers who play poker with some basics, but can't help it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Fiskantes/status/1323967996491141120))
	- 2/5 If I say I have 1/6 odds (roughly 16.6%) of getting a 6 and 5/6 (roughly 83,4%) of hitting 1,2,3,4,5 rolling dice, it doesn't mean my model was wrong if I roll 6!
	  
	  It just means that less likely realization of reality materialized.
	- 3/5 So if a model or prediction market predicts 30% T wins and 70% B wins and then T wins it doesnt mean it was wrong! 30% is not 0%! 
	  
	  Good mental exercise is to split the future into 100 alternative realities. In 30 of them T wins, in 70 B wins.
	- 4/5 Elections are obv much more fuzzy than rolling dice. There are changing data inputs, there is more reflexivity (polls and media can influence the outcome itself) etc. 
	  
	  Also every election is 1 of a kind event, so we will never have good samplesize, unlike repeated games.
	- 5/5 But to conclude that model is wrong when less likely scenario happens is epistemological blunder, that can cost you a lot if you bet / invest / trade / play poker etc.
