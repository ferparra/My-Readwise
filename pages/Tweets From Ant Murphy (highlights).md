	- I know a PM who has a principle which is “give & receive gifts”
	  
	  He explained it to me as:
	  
	  Give = when you communicate/handover/etc package it like a gift. They should thank you for the doc or whatever it was.
	  
	  Receive = accept ideas/feedback/doc/etc as gifts. Always say thanks. https://t.co/DsoswzWSc1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ant_murphy/status/1397447975832461314))
	- PMs DON'T need domain knowledge to be effective.
	  
	  The mindset that product roles MUST know the domain is often a recipe for “I know what the customers want”
	  
	  vs
	  
	  Little/no domain knowledge acting as a forcing function to do proper discovery, to learn and uncover user needs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ant_murphy/status/1471017434022879232))

	- Are you planning or building a plan and hoping for the best?
	  
	  Break out of the perfect plan trap. 
	  
	  Instead:
	  * Come up with ur perfect plan
	  * Wargame it: pre-mortem’s are a great!
	  * Prioritise & mitigate risks
	  * Develop alternatives (“mini-plans”)

	- Asking teams to set quarterly OKRs is meaningless if those teams are still stuck in 9 month release cycles...
	  
	  Clean your house first. Focus on delivering frequently and then progress to determining whether what you've delivered is valuable or not. Ideally do both. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ant_murphy/status/1595650670329151488))
