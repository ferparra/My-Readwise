- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- all fields have about 10-20 core principles and the tech stack is just trying to make those things easier, so don't fret overit.
	- I've learned to be honest with my manager. Not too honest, but honest enough where I can be authentic at work. What's the worse that can happen? He fire me? I'll just pick up a new job in 2 weeks.
	- Good code is code that can be understood by a junior engineer.  Great code can be understood by a first year CS freshman.  The best code is no code at all.

	- writing good proposals for changes is a great skill.
	- Don't meet your heroes. I paid 5k to take a course by one of my heroes.  He's a brilliant man, but at the end of it I realized that he's making it up as he goes along like the rest of us.
	- Third party recruiters are leeches.  However, if you find a good one, seriously develop a good relationship with them. They can help bootstrap your career.  How do you know if you have a good one? If they've been a third party recruiter for more than 3 years, they're probably bad.  The good ones typically become recruiters are large companies.
	- My self worth is not a function of or correlated with my total compensation.  Capitalism is a poor way to determine self-worth.
	- Be kind to everyone.  Not because it'll help your career (it will), but because being kind is rewarding by itself.
	- Paying for classes, books, conferences is worth it.  I've done a few conferences, a few 1.5k courses, many books, and a subscription.  Worth it. This way, I can better pretend what I'm doing.
	- You know what the best part of being a software engineer is?  You can meet and talk to people who think like you.  Not necessarily the same interests like sports and TV shows and stuff.  But they think about problems the same way you think of them.  That's pretty cool.
	- Being a good engineer means knowing best practices.  Being a senior engineer means knowing when to break best practices.
	- The best demonstration of great leadership is when my leader took the fall for a mistake that was 100% my fault.  You better believe I would've walked over fire for her.
	- On the same token, the best leaders I've been privileged to work under did their best to both advocate for my opinions and also explain to me other opinions 'that conflict with mine.  I'm working hard to be like them.
