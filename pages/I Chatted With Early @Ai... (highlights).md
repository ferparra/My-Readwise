	- I chatted with early @airtable employee and angel investor @edavidpeterson about the current state of product-led growth.
	  
	  He shared some awesome insights into how today's best SaaS companies are learning from the challenges faced by @Dropbox, @SlackHQ and other early PLG co'süëá

		- **Note**: Thread
	- Both Dropbox and Slack famously started with heavily bottom-up GTM strategies that let them expand without hiring salespeople:
	- Dropbox and Slack showed how small teams building B2B SaaS could grow insanely fast.
	  
	  But both of them struggled with moving upmarket, with @Box dominating the enterprise and Slack eventually selling to @salesforce.

	- For David, the early PLG companies had 3 big shortcomings:
	  
	  1) Adopters are not necessarily buyers, complicating the sales process
	  2) Layering on sales once you‚Äôre growing quickly can create toxic politics
	  3) Simple PLG product design doesn‚Äôt align with enterprise customer needs ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/janerikasplund/status/1415376803905122308))
	- 1) As @karanortman wrote RE: @upfrontvc‚Äôs investment in @endgamelabs, while our understanding of the right product/customer metrics for measuring bottom-up adoption has advanced a lot in the last decade, sales is often stuck in a pre-PLG paradigm.

	- 2) Then there's the organizational challenge.
	  
	  ‚ÄúIf you've grown‚Ä¶ on the back of product and maybe some marketing, and then all of a sudden sales comes in, you're setting the stage for a political battle, whether you like it or not.‚Äù ‚Äî@edavidpeterson ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/janerikasplund/status/1415376806459363330))
	- 3) Lastly, while it was hard for simple products like Dropbox and Slack to satisfy enterprise customer needs, modern PLG companies like @airtable @retool  @figmadesign and @webflow have both low barriers to entry and high ceilings.
	  
	  Simple to get started‚Äîbut deeply customizable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/janerikasplund/status/1415376807499608066))
	- As a result, the best ‚ÄúPLG‚Äù companies today ask different kinds of questions of their sales efforts:
	- You‚Äôre seeing a lot more savvy early team-building around these insights‚Äîlike @figmadesign hiring ex-Dropbox @KyleHParrish early on to start figuring out their strategy for selling into the enterprise.

	- You‚Äôre also seeing companies like @retool @Hopin @vercel @webflow using tools like @WorkOS and @TrustVanta to be enterprise-ready from day 1.
	  
	  And after spiking during the early PLG era, the average SaaS time-to-SSO is now dropping fast.

	- For @edavidpeterson, the insight is that "PLG" itself is a misnomer.
	  
	  The goal is not product-led or sales- and marketing-led growth, but growth as a unified effort across the team.
	  
	  And while that sounds good, it can be uncomfortable in practice. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/janerikasplund/status/1415376816555053057))
	- We covered a lot more ground in our chat with David.
