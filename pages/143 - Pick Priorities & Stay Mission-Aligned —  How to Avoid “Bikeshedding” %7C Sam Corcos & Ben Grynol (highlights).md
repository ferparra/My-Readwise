	- Should We Build a Nuclear Power Plant in Our Town Or Not?
	  
	  Summary:
	  An economist wanted to understand how decisions were made in local governments, and looked out a town that was building a nuclear power plant. And he was surprised to discover that the overwhelming majority of the conversation had to do with what color the bike shed should be. That's so um, people will often fix it on something that's small and understandable, that they feel like they have control over.

	  It's also known as the law of triviality. You can look it up on on wicpedia. Sure, it came from what is potentially an apocryphal story, but somebody think it was. An economist wanted to understand how decisions were made in local governments, and looked out a town that was building a nuclear power plant in their town, which is a pretty big son. And he wanted to understand how these decisions get made. And he was surprised to discover that the overwhelming majority of the conversation had to do with what color the bike shed should be, and like, how many bikes should it hold? An completely missing the point of bike. Should webuild a nuclear power plant in our town or not? That's so um, people will often fix it. When when there's a really harrid problem, people will often fix it on something that's small and understandable, that they feel like they have control over. So that, should we build a nuclear power plant in our town? There's a lot of like, consequences doing that. Like, maybe it's good, maybe it's not. It's, it's hard to be the person to take responsibility of that. It's a really uncomfortable thing but like, everyone has his opinion on should it be blue or green, or like, whatever the bikeshed should ([Time 0:03:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7b0ba6e1-16c1-463f-8b66-c98fcf99b00b))
	- Taking Time Off
	  
	  Summary:
	  It's typically not until the third, maybe even the fourth day a being away from the hyperoctive hive mind, that i'm able to really think new thoughts. And it was because each incremental decision made sense and it was achievable as well. Like doing the hard thing seemed like something to do off in the distant future. I recognize it more specifically after, or after the company was acquired. But it was in the moment when we were in that product meeting, i knew that something was wrong.

	  So that's one of the reasons why i i really encouraged people on our team to take time off, to do think weeks, to have some separation from the day to day. It's i found that i do. I do a week off a quarter, i think weeks. And it's really not, it's typically not until the third, maybe even the fourth day a being away from the hyperoctive hive mind, that i'm able to really think new thoughts, wen be able to see the bigger picture. It's why i really do think there's there's a different mind set that has to be there in order to see t the bigger picture, move away from what seems really important in the moment.

	  When was it at cardash? Did you recognize when it was happening, or was it sort of reflecting on it afterwards? Were you like, men, that's like, what happen? Like, were you aware of it when it was happening, or like, what? What did that look like?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I i, i was aware of it after it was too late. Like, i i recognize it more specifically after, or after the company was acquired. But it was in the moment when we were in that product meeting, i knew that something was wrong, because i recognized that almost all our resourcis in both design and engineering, was going towards improving operational efficiency of a product that still hadn't reachd product market fete. And it was because each incremental decision made sense and it was achievable as well. Like doing the hard thing seemed like something to do off in the distant future.

	- Is It Too Late?
	  
	  Summary:
	  I was aware of it after it was too late. I recognized that almost all our resourcis in both design and engineering, was going towards improving operational efficiency for a product that still hadn't reachd product market fete. Like doing the hard thing seemed like something to do off in the distant future. But we could solve this very narrowly defined project that was right in front of us. And it was like, definitely hit a single here, and when you would get it delivered, it would feel really good. The company is now valued at more than $10 billion.
