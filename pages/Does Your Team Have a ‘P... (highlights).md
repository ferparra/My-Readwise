	- Does your team have a ‘presentation culture’ or a ‘memo culture’?
	  
	  After living through both, I’ve come to believe there is a better approach..

	- And, thanks to @eddiesclin for the fun comic of this idea. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lshackleton/status/1433454236973424645))
	- 1) Let’s start with some historical context.
	  
	  Over the last 40 years, we’ve seen two significant changes in how work gets discussed and decisions get made. 
	  
	  And I think we’re entering a third phase. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lshackleton/status/1433454238042972165))
	- 2) Phase #1: Slide presentations, aka the Powerpoint generation
	  
	  In 1987 Powerpoint launched, and it was an incredible tool. But we’ve all been there, waiting through boring presentations for the ‘real’ discussion. Love them or hate them, slides are the de facto standard.

	- 3) Phase #2: One-way writeups, aka Amazon six-page memos
	  
	  In 2004, Jeff Bezos wrote his famous ‘No more Powerpoint’ memo, and Amazon started planning in doc-based memos.

	- 4) And just over a year later, Writely launched with collaborative editing.
	  
	  Writely would later get acquired and become Google Docs.

	- 5) Inspired by Bezos’ ‘No Powerpoint’ challenge, and empowered with collaborative doc editing, teams started to make the shift from slides to writeups.
	  
	  Note: ‘writeup’ = catch-all term for a written doc to help teams achieve a goal, like a project plan, memo, design doc, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lshackleton/status/1433454249787072515))
	- 6) I call this type of writeup ‘one-way’ because it’s like printing a piece of paper & putting it on someone’s desk. You’ve done all the talking.
	  
	  Unfortunately, the audience interaction is crammed into the comments: a 100-pixel space in the right margin.

	- 7) I see 3 problems with one-way writeups:
	- 8) One CEO I interviewed memorably said:
	  
	  “It feels like the most important decisions in our company are jammed into the 100-pixel panel hanging off the side of our Google Docs. Is that really the best we can do?” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lshackleton/status/1433454255109664776))
	- 9) That leads to a key ritual at Coda & one of our secrets to shipping fast, with high quality: two-way writeups.
	  
	  Phase #3: Two-way writeups start w/ the premise that questions/feedback are key to fast iteration—not combing through Google Doc comments to make progress.

	- 10) With two-way writeups, you can:
	- 11) As one fellow product leader put it to me:
	  
	  “We switched to two-way writeups. It’s a game-changer when you know exactly where people stand on a topic. It saved us time and heartache.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lshackleton/status/1433454260809723906))
