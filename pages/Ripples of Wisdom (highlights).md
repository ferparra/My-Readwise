document_note:: Ripples of Wisdom by Don Jose Ruiz is a book that encourages readers to become aware of and overcome self-doubt, self-deceit and fear in order to live a life filled with love. It echoes the same lessons found in other books by Don Miguel Ruiz, such as The Four Agreements and Mastery of Love. These lessons include not making assumptions, not taking things personally, doing one's best, and being impeccable with one's word.

	- "Everyone has the right to believe what they want to believe. They have the right to feel what they want to feel and go say what they want to say. If you take everything personally, you may feel defensive or hurt. Instead ofjuiding what others say listen and show respect. Remember everything isn't ways about you."

		- **Note**: "Everyone is allowed to think what they want to think and feel how they want to feel. If you take things too seriously, you might get mad or feel bad. Instead of judging what other people say, try to listen and be kind. Remember, not everything is about you."
	- "Making assumptions and then taking them personally is the beginning of hell. An assumption is just a lie you are telling yourself. This creates a big drama inside your mind, and you have no idea if it's really truth or not. Be aware that most of the drama in your life is caused by an amazing, creative story you have made up. Ask questions before creating a story and find peace in truth." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsfgtdxk2kc6zwbfjgbn021f))
		- **Note**: "When you make up stories in your head and think they're true, it can make you feel really bad. A story like this is called an assumption, and it's like a lie you're telling yourself. Before you make up stories, it's important to ask questions and find out what is really true. That way, you can find peace in knowing the truth."
