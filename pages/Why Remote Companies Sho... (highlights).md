	- Why remote companies should value writing:
	  
	  1. Better decisions.
	  
	  Companies are more likely to be driven by politics if key decisions are made by talking. Spoken conversations reward confidence and appeals to authority. Writing rewards logic and structure. From Ethos to Logos.

	- 2. Writing helps the best idea win: In spoken conversations, people tend to automatically with the CEO. But anybody can write, which democratizes decision-making. On paper, since nobody knows who wrote each sentence, "what is said" is more important than "who said it." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1585662928400928771))
	- 3. A useful barrier: Long-form writing is proof of work. Clear writing is clear thinking. When the writing is good, you know somebody's taken the time to think through what they're saying. As a leader, you can't willy-nilly propose a strategy and expect everybody to run with it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1585662929722015744))
	- 4. Focusing on details: It's been said that the printing press accelerated progress not by producing more ideas, but by making existing ideas more concrete. People could debate 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘶𝘭𝘢𝘳 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘴𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦𝘴 instead of the overall tenor of an argument. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1585662931026444301))
	- 5. Rigor: Look at the difference between an in-person meeting and a Google Doc. It's so easy to talk past the other person in a spoken conversation. But you can be much more precise in a Google Doc. You can debate individual sentences in the comments and replies. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1585662932221890564))
	- 6. Transparency: Writing reduces politics. Not everybody can be in the room for an important conversation. When ideas are shared in a meeting or on a phone call, they get lost and forgotten. Nobody else gets to hear them. Writing is the opposite because it can be read by anybody. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1585662933429878787))
	- 7. Writing scales, but meetings don't: When a company is small, it's easy to get aligned. You’re working closely with everybody, so you can assume that people have a similar vision. But as a company grows, you need to move from talking to writing.

	- 8. Company-level awareness: At @Levels, every new [[leadership]] hire spends the first six weeks writing a long-form [[strategy]] document about their [[area of focus]]. By doing so, they integrate their own expertise with the company's, and create alignment around their work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1585662936017768450))
	- 9. Freedom & flexibility: The ability to set your own hours is a major perk of remote work. The more work happens asynchronously, the more people can work at a time that's most convenient for them. But in a meeting heavy culture, you have to work in sync with everybody else.

	- 10. Hiring: Companies like Cloudflare and Netflix used their company blogs to attract top-notch technical talent. I think we'll increasingly see companies hire "Writers in Residence" to take internal memos and polish them up for a public audience.

	- Should you only write? No.
	  
	  Conversations work well in the early stages of planning, when the ideas are fuzzy and just getting formed (though you should take written notes). Short supplemental videos are also useful when you need to communicate something sensitive or emotional. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1585662940321124352))
