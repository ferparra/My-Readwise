	- Powerful tools for thought usually arise as a byproduct of real work in a field rather than "I have an idea for a tool!" (Hindu-Arabic numerals, microscopes, RenderMan, Mathematica). => People interested in tools must get into a context s.t. real work incites tool-work. Not easy!

	- Have been experimenting with this unusual Dasung portable e-ink display for park working sessions. It's surprisingly responsive—plenty good enough for writing, coding, studying. HDMI driven, weighs about 1.5lbs, sits in front of my normal display (& uses much less power, ofc).

	- Over-simplified review of evidence on impact of background music on creative work: small hit to memory/attention, but makes you happier, so you may do better work on net.
	  
	  Good collabs have a similar logic. Distracting, coord costs—but making work more fun may be high-order bit. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1455688605825785859))
	- Everything's almost always better when I attend to process itself, rather than outcomes. (I can somehow never remind myself enough…)
	  
	  Lovely reflections on this in Matthew Frederick's "101 things I learned in architecture school" (via @mollyfmielke): https://t.co/miOtWh6bY8

	- For the past few months I've really been enjoying "instantaneous generosity" as suggested by Joseph Goldstein (via Oliver Burkeman): "whenever a generous impulse arises…to give money, check in on a friend, send an email praising someone's work—act on the impulse right away."
