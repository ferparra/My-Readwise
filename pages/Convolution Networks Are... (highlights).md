	- Convolution networks are on their last gasps of life.  Facebook's Segment-Anything uses ViT models (i.e., transformers).  When diffusion models migrate to ViT, it'll be completely wild!! https://t.co/4aswW1dAIf ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IntuitMachine/status/1643978052169535488))

	- ViT (Vision Transformers) have been shown previously to do well with recognizing semantics in images. https://t.co/CA0vasYX72 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IntuitMachine/status/1643978593649987584))
	- This all aligns with my conjecture years ago that all vision is actually touch.  ViTs feel through space like a transformer feels through words. https://t.co/ZJuvXo3KOm ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IntuitMachine/status/1643978977831419904))
	- Touch is an intermingling of parallel and sequential processes.  It's a semiotic process where meaning is established through a sequence of discovery of meaning.  This is why transformer are ubiquitous everywhere in deep learning... with the exception of diffusion models. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/IntuitMachine/status/1643979681648214016))
