		- **Note**: Thread
	- .[[@Logseq]] is the closest thing to event sourcing in note-taking and knowledge management. It is opposed to traditional top-down note-taking, where you'd start with a blank slate and end up with an entire coherent train of thought.

	- In [[@Logseq]], one pieces their ideas together out of many disparate bits they have added over time. This is thanks to Logseq's support of backlinks and its built-in journal. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/preslavrachev/status/1592557976983724033))
	- The journal removes the pressure of writing something all at once, or else the thought will vanish. https://t.co/jn9QaJJ5Rc ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/preslavrachev/status/1592557979517083648))
	- Instead, it encourages the user to write down the tiniest bit of information that will contribute to an ongoing story and link to that story. https://t.co/XivFI57Orj ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/preslavrachev/status/1592557982218215424))

	  But wait, what is event sourcing? ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/preslavrachev/status/1592557984961306624))
	- Event sourcing is a technique for storing data that emphasizes keeping the sequence of events leading up to the current state rather than the current state itself. This allows for a complete reconstruction of the system's state at any given time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/preslavrachev/status/1592557987398176774))
