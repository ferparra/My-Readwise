	- Did you know that Australia almost paid off its national debt? They got it down to 4.7% of GDP.
	  
	  That shows it's possible.

	- Australia and New Zealand have surprisingly good financials relative to the G7. They may be the best run countries in the Western world.

	- More evidence for Australia and New Zealand as the best of the West: they're successfully competing[1,2] with places like Dubai for global millionaires.

	- OK, so what are they doing different?!?
	  
	  My rough impression is: Down Under is a bizarro world where right and left are actually effective.

	- ASSET SALES PAID DEBTS
	  Now, the next question is: how did Australia manage to pay down its debt? This source[1] says a good chunk of the debt was paid off via large asset sales. For example, the sale of Sydney Airport to a private consortium for $4.2B.
