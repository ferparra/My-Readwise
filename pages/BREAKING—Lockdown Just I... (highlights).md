	- 2) This follows Shenzhen‚Äôs urgent lockdown yesterday. Shenzhen is the ‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù tech and industrial epicenter of China.  This likely has global implications if longer than a few days. All production is ceased during this time. https://t.co/GFIk8Eb9xM ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1503272072134414338))
	- 3) How serious is China about what is happening in Jilin? It has begun building a 6000-bed hospital isolation center‚Ä¶ with work crews working 24 hours around the clock‚Äî scheduled completion is in 6 days from groundbreaking. Live camera of construction: https://t.co/pedHx9L3ek

	- 4) Why is China so concerned suddenly about Jilin Province? Because it is worried about #BA2 and how aggressive it is. Notably, Shenzhen authorities interestingly said BA2‚Äôs ‚Äúconcealment is very high‚Äù ‚Äî I‚Äôve NEVER heard of that declaration before. But it must be for a reason. ü§î https://t.co/AXhO1eTkCC ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1503273598466805760))
	- 5) all this is very reminiscent of Jan 2020 in Wuhan. While we now have vaccines, I think China‚Äôs SinoVac and Sinopharm and CanSino vaccines are somewhat weaker than mRNA ones, and their booster coverage is not high. BA2 is also much worse. China needs to avoid a larger crisisüëá https://t.co/z624fKWORw ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1503280673980923906))
	- 6) Hong Kong and Shenzhen are adjacent cities separated by an internal border check. But there are enormous flows of people between the regions. And when one has an epic outbreak, almost inevitably the other is at risk‚Ä¶ this is why we worry so much that likely Shenzhen is next. https://t.co/lP4g5UW7oH ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1503301026119663618))
	- 7) Lockdowns in China are because they are desperate for control of the situation. There are too many vulnerable inside of mainland China if they lose the containment battle against #BA2. https://t.co/OMA3UMgTr2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1503431759492489222))
	- 8) end of the day, China is in dire trouble with #BA2 because it is neither basic vaccinated enough nor boosted enough. And that is why I have my sinking feeling in my stomach. It‚Äôs not just for China but it‚Äôs for China‚Äôs impact on the world https://t.co/kazLYj9P0l ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1503447128219303939))
	- 9) because of COVID surging out of control, Chinese company stocks are being battered today -- worst day in HK market history since 2008-2009 financial crisis!  https://t.co/n4v0AZnpVV ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1503481111539851272))
