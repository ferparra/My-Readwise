	- 1/ I recently finished digging into a body of work around extracted tacit mental models of business expertise, and it is wild.
	  
	  It turns out that business experts all share a common mental model of business, and you can do all sorts of interesting things if you have that model. https://t.co/OH5eOWtVpZ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1417689411374915584))

	- 2/ Lia DiBello writes, of her work:
	  
	  “… we noticed that highly talented business performers are very similar to each other. (…) business is an orderly closed system of relations between principles, and so-called intuitive experts in business have an implicit grasp of this.”

	- 3/ That's an excerpt from her chapter in the Oxford Handbook of Expertise, a chonky book that I shouldn't have any right in owning.
	  
	  The excerpt was so compelling I dove into Lia DiBello's entire publication history.

	- 4/ What I found: DiBello has spent her entire career extracting tacit mental models of expertise from business experts.
	  
	  To my surprise, she hasn't published as much, but that's mostly because she has spent the bulk of the past 20 years consulting for companies.

	- 5/ So what is that model? Glad you asked.
	  
	  The basic idea is this:
	  
	  Business expertise consists of two main things — domain-specific mental models, and a property called cognitive agility.
	  
	  The domain-specific mental models map to a core shared model of business expertise. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1417692426068652041))
	- 6/ That core shared mental model is basically a triad. For convenience we'll name it first, before diving in:
	  
	  a) Supply
	  b) Demand
	  c) Capital
	  
	  This is taken from her 2010 chapter in Informed by Knowledge (snippet below):

	- 7/ It's important to understand that this triad is extremely general in nature. How it is expressed is radically different, depending on the industry.
	  
	  So, for supply — factors involved in effective ops looks different in a yoghurt company vs a mining company vs a SaaS. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1417693266338713600))
	- 8/ The key marker of skill is in the ability of the businessperson to intuitively understand how changes in one leg of the triad affects the other two legs.
	  
	  This also explains how a good businessperson is able to recognise another good businessperson:

	- 9/ So for instance, if there's a change in the capital environment, how does that affect competition? (The market — the demand leg of the triad). 
	  
	  And what changes must the company make? (This is supply). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1417694966046887939))
	- 10/ DiBello also uses the names leadership/strategy/finance. To map it to our previous terms:
	  
	  Supply — Leadership (factors that affect operations)
	  Demand — Strategy (factors that affect the market)
	  Capital — Finance (factors that affect business finance or access to capital) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1417695124709003264))
	- 11/ How does this intuitive understanding of the triad express itself? DiBello's insight is that it allows the businessperson the ability to a) notice cues that novices do not, and b) predict changes as a result of those cues in each leg of the triad.
	  
	  This was a profound insight ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1417695464221122560))
	- 12/ It meant, for instance, that business expertise MAY BE EVALUATED. And that it may be trained.
	  
	  Before we talk about the evaluation technique she invented, we need to talk about the second component of business expertise: cognitive agility. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1417695695021109251))
	- 13/ Cognitive agility is defined as the ability of an exec to update his or her mental models in response to changing situations.

	- 14/ Cognitive rigidity is the opposite: where the person is impervious to new data, and is 'dominated by a rigid framework or paradigm that acts to filter out new, possibly relevant, information, creating blind spots.

	- 15/ This explains a LOT. I've written about how I am uncomfortable with frameworks in the past, because I've often been put in situations in business where no framework could fully explain the effects I saw around me. I've grappled with this topic a lot: https://t.co/lvmnAoQOfQ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1417696923671154690))
	- 16/ In fact, I've also observed that the WORST people to hire in a startup environment are those with high 'cognitive rigidity'. I even wrote an entire blog post attempting to pin down that property: https://t.co/p6xrLmdv5m ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1417697222460801027))
	- 17/ DiBello got there more than a decade before I did. I was delighted to learn that other businesspeople have noticed:

	- 18/ The key point that DiBello makes re: cognitive agility is that it is by far the more important skill when it comes to business. More important than general problem solving ability.
	  
	  And she developed a way to evaluate it, too. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1417698022327160835))
