	  Inside every recipe within my Recipe Book, I have a synced block for my grocery list.
	  
	  This means I can see it from any recipe.

	  If you're obsessed, you'll work longer, harder, and better. And you'll be ENERGIZED by your work.
	  
	  If you're not obsessed, you'll have to fall back on productivity band-aids like Pomodoro apps. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1613609166018314264))
