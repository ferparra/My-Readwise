	  Speaker 1
	  And this takes a bit of training, like anything, if you want to learn to play guitar or code computer, and it really changes your relationship inside so that sadness comes. And first, you can recognize it. Oh, here's sadness. You name it, sad, sad, you give it space. You see, its story tells it'll always be this way and you know, why this happened and so forth. And you become the mindful witness of it, the kind witness that says, oh, this is sadness. And then something really wonderful also begins to happen. You don't take it so personally.

	- The Importance of Recognizing and Tuning In to Pain
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Thoughts can protect us from pain and difficulty, and help us get what we need to be safe., * To plant healthy thoughts, we need to be aware of our story and the pain it's causing us.)

	  Speaker 1
	  You said something also really important in your comment, because our thoughts try to keep us safe. In all kinds of ways, try to keep us safe from pain, from, you know, difficulty from humiliation from loss and so forth, and try to help us get everything around us that will keep protect us and keep us safe, whether it's money or place or something. So even when I see, or especially maybe when I see what seemed to be unhealthy thoughts, instead of adding judgment on top of it, I can say, thank you for trying to protect me, or thank you for trying to keep me safe. I'm okay. You can relax. And then I go about, you know, planting better seeds than that in my heart and mind.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Is there a way to go about planting those seeds where we can acknowledge or recognize our story? We can sort of see the impact it's having on us. We can even witness it. But then how do we go about substituting one story for another? Maybe a destructive story for a more productive story.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So the first step, of course, is just to recognize them. And then to tune in a little bit to the fear or the pain that's behind them. ([Time 0:17:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b19253e5-d70b-4681-b59b-a44845dd44ce))
	- The Art of Forgiveness
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* There is a whole training that is so healthy and helpful for us as human beings to learn the art of forgiveness., * Forgiveness doesn't mean forgiven forget, and it doesn't condone what happened., * You really need to see what happened. Clearly feel the suffering of it in whatever way that's happened to you, or somebody else, and then resolve to do whatever you can to stop that suffering.)

	  Speaker 1
	  There's a whole training that is so healthy and helpful for us as human beings to learn the art of forgiveness. And there's some critical things about it. First of all, forgiveness doesn't mean forgiven forget, and it doesn't condone what happened. You really need to see what happened. Clearly feel the suffering of it in whatever way that's happened to you, or somebody else, and then resolve to do whatever you can to stop that suffering, you know, that you will stand up or you will do whatever it takes so that the suffering doesn't continue. So it's not like rolling over in any way. But then forgiveness is about what you carry in yourself. And without it, we're lost. Without it, you have the vutus in the tutsis or the Bosnians in the Serbs or the Northern Irish Catholic Protestants say, your people march through our neighborhood, you know, 89 or 200 years ago, and we're not going to let this stop and we'll do that. And you just keep the cycle going. And some point it has to stop with someone. Someone has to say it stops here. I remember a woman who I was working with who was in the middle of a terrible divorce. And the guy that she'd married was a successful type A lawyer. And he was trying to keep all the money and also get custody of the children and spinning stories about her as a bad mother. And when it was actually he who had had the series of affairs. At some point, she came into me, she said, you know, my ex is doing these things telling our children these stories and trying to turn them against me. He's been doing that. And she said, I've been sitting with this. She was had learned to meditate some. And she said, I come to a revelation. I will not bequeath a legacy of bitterness to my children about their father. I will not say a bad word about him no matter what he does. And when she said that, I was so moved, not because she wouldn't protect her children and get a good lawyer do what she could. But she was saying, I'm not going to play this game. It stops with me. I will be big enough, if you will, to say that the long term benefit for us as humanity is not to carry the suffering from the past. How do you want to live as a human being? Do you want to carry that suffering in the bitterness? Or can you forgive yourself? Because we also have a lot to forgive in our own lives. Or others, even though it wasn't right, and even though it wasn't fair, it simply did not carry the hatred in your heart to see clearly and realize that who I am is bigger than that.
