	- Headings are massively improved in 0.8.17!
	  
	  There are now three ways the create headings in Logseq:
	  
	  1) Using Markdown syntax (#, ##, ###)
	  2) Using the context menu
	  3) Based on nesting levels

	- Embed tweets on whiteboards!
	  
	  Simply paste the URL of a tweet, or drag a block containing a tweet onto the canvas to show its contents.
	  
	  (Whiteboards are currently for Backers and Sponsors only as we're fine-tuning the feature before adding it to the main release). https://t.co/PDes297rqY ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/logseq/status/1624112919414988800))
	- Slice and dice your advanced query results with even more input filters!
	  
	  Thanks to @barrelltech, you can now precisely tune query results with relative time and date inputs.

	- Last but not least, we've added an extra variable for the quick capture template.
	  
	  Apart from {time}, {text}, and {url}, you can now use {date} in config.edn to show the current date anytime you use the quick capture.
	  
	  Use [[{date}]] to turn the variable into a date link.
