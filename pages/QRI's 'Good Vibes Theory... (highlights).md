	- QRI's 'Good Vibes Theory' (GVT) is a speculative proposal for a physics of consciousness. This theory aims to establish an ontological foundation for a future rigorous science of good vibes. üßµüßµüßµ  #psychedelicthermodynamics #goodvibestheory https://t.co/QIWVj6mhDh ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/QualiaRI/status/1626768226196811776))

	- Two groups will make the most use of GVT; one is the "vibe engineers," who are grounded in creating good vibes technically, and the mystics, who want to connect good vibes to deep insights and truths of wisdom traditions.

	- There is a deep connection between the shape of things and the way they vibrate. Different shapes have different energies, as their curvature, complexity, and surface area increase.

	- Internal representations act as energy sinks that absorb and channel ambient energy. They are often symmetrical and have semantic meaning, which makes them effective energy sinks. These representations also radiate energy and have energizing effects *to other representations*.

	- In physics, the Hamiltonian of a system is a measure of the system's total energy. Similarly, the Hamiltonian of [[Consciousness]] would formulate how to add up all the energy of each component of a bound experience created by a system to get the total energy of that experience.

	- We propose a new framework, ‚ÄúPsychedelic thermodynamics‚Äù, which offers a novel perspective on energy flow in consciousness.

	- In this framework, one person's energy sink is another person's energy source. The energy flows from sensory input to consciousness, where it's transformed into internal representations or "solitons" and released through motor actions or field radiation.

	- The conscious experience is shaped by the energy radiated from internal representations known as gestalts, which interact with each other to produce the texture and valence of the experience. The shape of the gestalts determines the vibe they radiate.

	- The "vibes" of our experiences are determined by the interaction of our internal representations, and dissonance can arise from being out of phase with input, incompatibility with noise, misshaped, or dissonance with other representations.

	- Psychedelic Thermodynamics suggests that the valence of a psychedelic experience depends on whether the input is in tune with the background noise, with misshapen or incompatible inputs leading to dissonance and negative valence.

	- Input effects are the result of how external stimuli interact with internal representations in conscious experience. The degree of coherence between the input and the background noise, as well as the shape and resonance of the internal representation, determine input's feeling.
