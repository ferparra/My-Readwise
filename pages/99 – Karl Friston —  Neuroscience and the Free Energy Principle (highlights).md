	- Is There a Drop of Oil?
	  
	  Summary:
	  If something exists, what properties must it display? That's the deflationy part of the freeengine principle. The fr principle does not supply an answer as to why. It is a necessary condition for existence that this must occur. So how would you describe things that configure themselves out of nothing? And so from the point of view of computational chemistry, for example,  themodamic free energy.

	  Speaker 1
	  And why is it not dissolved? I was in maintaining itself. Exactly.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  What actions is it? I mean, it's such a fascinating idea of a drop of oil and I guess it would dissolve in water, it wouldn't dissolve in water.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So what? Precisely. So why not?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So why not? Why not? And how do you mathematically describe it? I mean, it's such a beautiful idea. It's also the idea of like, where does the drop of oil end and where does it begin? Right.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  So I mean, you're asking deep questions deep in a non-millennial sense here. A hierarchical sense. But what you can do is, so this is a deflationary part of it. Can I just qualify myself by saying that normally when I'm asked this question, I answer from the point of view of a psychologist, we talk about predictive processing and predictive coding and the brain as an inference machine. But you have asked me from that perspective, I'm answering from the point of view of a physicist. So the question is not so much why, but if it exists, what properties must it display? So that's the deflationary part of the 300 principle. The 300 principle does not supply an answer as to why. It's saying, if something exists, then it must display these properties. That's the sort of thing that's on offer. And it so happens that these properties, it must display actually intriguing and have this inferential gloss, this sort of self-evidancing gloss that inherits from the fact that the very preservation of the boundary between the oil drop and the not oil drop requires an optimization of a particular function or a functional that defines the presence or the existence of this oil drop, which is why I started with existential imperatives. It is a necessary condition for existence that this must occur because the thing, the boundary basically defines the thing that's existing. So it is that self-assembly aspect. It's that you were hinting at, in biology, sometimes known as autopoiesis in computational chemistry with self-assembly. It's the, what does it look like? Sorry, how would you describe things that configure themselves out of nothing? The way they clearly demarcate themselves from the states or the soup in which they are immersed. So from the point of view of computational chemistry, for example, you would just understand that as a configuration of a macro molecule to minimize its free energy, its thermodynamic free energy. It's exactly the same principle that we've been talking about that thermodynamic free energy is just the negative elbow. It's the same mathematical construct. So the very emergence of existence, of structure, of form that can be distinguished from the environment or the thing that is not the thing necessitates the existence of an objective function. Then it looks as if it is minimizing. It's finding a free energy minima. ([Time 0:50:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/82143a65-6c3e-4fae-857b-20bed96a8f40))
