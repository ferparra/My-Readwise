document_note:: This document explores the importance of mathematics in the context of game development. It explains how certain branches of mathematics, such as trigonometry, linear algebra, discrete math and artificial intelligence, are used in game development, as well as how understanding basic math notation can improve coding projects. Furthermore, it provides resources for further learning on the topic.

	- **Fun fact**: Having complex instructions that are able to perform multiple low-level tasks is the philosophy behind the [CISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer) architecture. Some famous CISC chips are the [Zilog Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80) and the [Intel x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86) family of CPUs. On the other hand, [RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86) chips with a reduced instruction set became very popular. The RISC architecture has a more efficient design, powering many small [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family) devices like mobile phones and tablets.

	- [Floating-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) arithmetic tries to represent real numbers approximately. It uses one bit for the sign, an integer with a fixed precision, scaled by an integer exponent of a fixed base. In a way, we can think of it as the [scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation) we used in school.

	- Game engine programmers are exposed to math topics related to rendering, animation, physics, audio, etc. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv7f2xkyhbejpcj3ykycp86x))
	- [Trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry) studies **trigons** (3-sided polygons), although we tend to simply call them *triangles.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv7f666qakvnw5cw7ja7hrgj))
	- I strongly encourage every game developer to learn how [sine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_and_cosine), [cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_and_cosine), [tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions), and [arctangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions) (inverse of tangent) works. There are other important concepts and functions, but these ones should be priority. To hit the ground running, [this video](https://youtu.be/yAHl_kpqr-k) from Keith Peters is a good intro to trigonometry with programmers in mind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv7f76wqvcnjr6apmbn1gw42))
	- Most programming frameworks and trig functions expect angles to be provided in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian) (not degrees!). You can visit [this short blog post](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-radian-and-vs-degree/) for a quick review of the differences between radians and degrees.

	- Vectors are the fundamental mathematical objects that are used in virtually every game and game engine. They are very popular in physics to representing quantities that encode both magnitude and direction, like velocity, acceleration, friction, and force. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv7f8aawedsg4htfvcnzk3yt))
	- The dot product is sometimes called *scalar product* because its result is always a scalar.
	  
	  The dot product \((\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B})\) has the geometric interpretation as being the length of the **projection** of \(\vec{B}\) onto the unit vector \(\hat{A}\). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv7f8mhm2ntw0n5pbm274axx))
	- The cross product of two vectors \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\) is *another vector* that is **perpendicular** to both vectors \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\).
	  
	  The result of the cross product between two vectors is **another vector**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv7f8t7zrkdka3y85w5rvjrj))
	- We also use linear algebra to perform special transformations like [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix), [scale](https://chortle.ccsu.edu/vectorlessons/vch06/vch06_2.html), and [translation](https://www.ck12.org/book/ck-12-geometry-second-edition/section/12.2/). These transformations are often handled by matrices.
	  
	  To transform (scale, rotate, and translate) our vertices, we can multiply them by a transformation matrix.
	  
	  We can have a matrix encode a rotation by a certain angle, and another matrix encoding a translation by a certain offset value. To change the original vertices of a 3D object, we simply [multiply](https://mathinsight.org/matrix_vector_multiplication) the transformation matrix by each vertex/vector of our mesh. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv7f9193rqbb3s6vnxwkxxsp))
	- Since we spoke about performing rotations using matrices, it's important to also mention that most modern engines use [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) to represent 3D orientation.
	  
	  Quaternions provide a convenient mathematical notation for representing spatial orientations and rotations of elements in 3D space. Specifically, they encode information about an axis-angle rotation about an arbitrary axis. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv7f99phshperqdbyy1km8tx))
	- Calculus is concerned with two basic operations, [differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative) and [integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral), and it is used to determine quantities as rates of change and areas. In fact, calculus is the mathematical backbone for dealing with problems where variables change with time or some other reference variable.

	- Set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets, which are collections of objects, such as {blue, white, red} or the (infinite) set of all prime numbers. Although we can't represent infinity with computers, in theory sets can have an infinite number of elements. In our case, there's always memory size and disk space to set hard boundaries of how many elements our sets can contain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv7fa4z3x9zzkezc86d714jv))
	- Another topic of discrete math that is extremely useful in computer science is [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), which studies graphs and networks. Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics. They are among the most ubiquitous models of both natural and human-made structures. They can model many types of relations and process dynamics in physical, biological and social systems. In computer science, they can represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, flow of computation, etc. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv7fc06axhpdme6mpa0yhvrz))
