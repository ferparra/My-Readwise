	- Part 1 - The Importance of Principles
	  
	  â€¢   Principles connect your values to your actions
	  â€¢   Without principles you'd be forced to react without thinking about your values and what you want
	  â€¢   Holding incompatible principles can lead to conflict between values and actions
	  â€¢   Your personal principles will determine your standards of behavior and how you interact with others
	  â€¢   **Question - What do you value most deeply?**
	    â€¢   **For me, it is love. Somebody who loves regardless of others or their situation** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4rjv7sx4s3a0er344wxmc8))
		- **Note**: "Having principles is important because it helps you figure out how to act in every situation. Without principles, you would have to decide what to do without thinking about what you value. If you have principles that don't match up well with each other, it can cause trouble. Your principles decide how you act and how you treat other people. So, the question is, what do you value most deeply? For me, I value love the most. That means no matter who somebody is or what their situation is, I will always show them love."
	- Limit bets to the limited number of things you are confident in ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4rmbjkptrqdxpsa5n5gvrb))

	- Failure is by and large due to not accepting and successfully dealing with the realities of live. Achieving success is simply a matter of accepting and successfully dealing with all realities ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4rmv2xyj5j6vf1t9fz8d6q))

	- Everyone makes mistakes and has weaknessesand that one of the most important things that differentiates people is their approach to handling them. There is an incredible beauty to mistakes, because embedded in each mistake is a puzzle, and a gem that I could get if I solved it (a principle that could be used in teh future to reduce mistakes). The more you wrestle with these mistakes and learn from them the more you appreciate your successes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4rp393j6wqvea1khnr4q59))

	- â€¢   **Truth - more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality - is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes**
	  â€¢   â€¢   What most people call "good" and "bad" typically reflects their particular group's preferences and are intended to paint a picture of the world the way they'd like it to be rather than the way it really is
	    â€¢   All get rewarded or punished according to whether we operate in harmony or in conflict with nature's laws
	    â€¢   Good - operating consistently with natural laws
	    â€¢   Bad - operating inconsistently with natural laws
	    â€¢   Evolution is the greatest single force in the universe since it fosters better adaptation. Bad things therefore are against improvement and impede evolution
	    â€¢   The desire to evolve, get better, is probably humanity's most pervasive driving force
	    â€¢   It is evolution and not the reward itself (money, houses, etc) that matters to us and those around us
	    â€¢   People who acquire things beyond their usefulness not only will derive little or no marginal gains from these acquisitions, but they also will experience negative consequences, such as gluttony
	    â€¢   Pursuing self-interest in harmony with the laws of the universe and contributing to evolution is universally rewarded, and can be thought of as "good"
	    â€¢   Society rewards those who give it what it wants. These people often do not have the goal of making money but it was simply a result of their actions
	    â€¢   The process of seeking, reaching, obtaining and pursuing new goals is universal and necessary
	    â€¢   Some of the most successful people are typically those who see the changing landscape and identify how to best adapt to it
	    â€¢   All things in nature have innate attributes that are both good and bad with their goodness and badness depending on what they are used for
	    â€¢   Typically, defensive, emotional reactions (ego barriers) stand in the way of progress and this is man's biggest impediment because it impedes people's abilities to address all other problems and is also probably people's greatest source of pain ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4rpz600gyprx7tczwrws4y))
	- â€¢   The quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we make
	  â€¢   1.  In order to evolve one has to push one's limits, which is painful, in order to gain strength. When we encounter pain we are at an important juncture in our decision making process. Those who react well to pain are those who understand what is causing it and how to deal with it so can be disposed of as a barrier. You are lucky to feel the pain if you approach it correctly since you will only find solutions to painful problems by thinking deeply about them
	    2.  Facing harsh realities can be difficult but by not facing them, you won't find ways of properly dealing with them and because these decisions will not be based in reality, they can't anticipate the consequences of their decisions
	    3.  People who worry about looking good typically hide what they don't know and hide their weaknesses, so they never learn how to properly deal with them and these weaknesses remain impediments in the future. Being great is not about having answers in your head, it is about learning how to deal with your impediments so that they aren't impediments in the future. The people who are interested in making the best possible decisions rarely are confident that they have the best possible answers. Incredibly important to be honest with yourself about what you don't know and know who to ask for help. **Question - what are your biggest weaknesses? Think honestly about them because if you can identify them, you are on the first step toward accelerating your movement forward. So, think about them, write them down, and look at them frequently.**
	        1.  too happy / satisfied - not desperate enough to take a big risk
	        2.  not prone to action/deep analysis - often have very many surface thoughts
	        3.  enjoy being a jack of all trades - may impede being truly great at something
	        4.  not as truthful as I could be - often tell white lies so that I can do what I want instead of being outright and honest
	    4.  People who overweigh the first order consequences of their decisions and ignore the effects of second and subsequent order consequences will have on their goals rarely reach their goals. First order consequences are often the temptations that cost us what we really want
	    5.  People who blame bad outcomes on anyone or anything other than themselves are behaving in a way that is at variance with reality and subversive to their progress. Blaming bad outcomes or anything or anyone other than oneself is essentially wishing that reality is different than it is and is subversive because it diverts one's attention away from mustering up the personal strength and other qualities that re required to produce the best possible outcomes. Successful people know that nature is testing them and that it is not sympathetic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4rs8rjrwzn94hacv28c302))

		- **Note**: When we make decisions in life, it affects the quality of our lives. To become better, we have to push ourselves beyond our comfort zone, even if it feels painful. If we understand what is causing the pain and how to deal with it, we can use it to our advantage. It can be hard to face harsh realities and admit our weaknesses, but it is important to be honest with ourselves and think about our biggest weaknesses. We should also be aware of how our decisions can have further consequences. Blaming other people or things for our problems will not help us reach our goals, instead, we need to take responsibility and realize that nature is testing us.
	- Have clear goals
	  
	  â€¢   Perhaps the most difficult step because it forces you to decide what you really want and therefore what you can possibly get out of life
	  â€¢   Pursuing too many goals at the same time often results in achieving few, or none, of them
	  â€¢   Need to prioritize and this requires rejecting MANY good alternatives
	  â€¢   Avoid setting goals based on what you think you can achieve - you can achieve virtually anything even if you don't know how you will do it at that moment
	  â€¢   Be totally flexible (good answers can come from anyone or anywhere) and totally accountable (it's your job to find these good answers no matter where they come from)
	  â€¢   Achieving goals isn't just about moving forward - make the best of your situation knowing that you will be rewarded if you do ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4rw3eztc7yjdwe5f2s3vyx))
		- **Note**: Having clear goals is very important. You need to decide what you really want and what you can get out of life. If you try to do too many things at once, you won't get very far. You have to pick and choose the best goals. Don't pick goals based on what you think you can do. You can do anything, even if you don't know how yet. You can learn how if you stay open to new ideas and work hard to find the best ones. Achieving your goals isn't just about getting to the finish line, you also need to make the most of your situation and you will be rewarded for it.
	- Identify and tolerate the problems that stand in the way of achieving your goals
	  
	  â€¢   Most problems are potential improvements screaming at you. The more painful the problem, the louder it is creaming - must perceive problems and not tolerate them
	  â€¢   Essential to bring problems to the surface which may be painful but most successful people know that they have to do this
	  â€¢   Be very precise in specifying your problem
	  â€¢   Don't confused problems with causes
	  â€¢   Once you identify your problems, you must not tolerate them
	  â€¢   â€¢   People who are strong at this step tend to have strong abilities to perceive and synthesize a clear and accurate picture, as well as demonstrate a fierce intolerance of badness (regardless of severity) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4rxf54d3krp2dkv2x2ytmm))
	- Recognize that people are built very differently ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4sc789rzspwghpgvct3b55))
	- Hire right, because the penalties of hiring wrong are huge ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4scd418scycr8574j0e4rk))

	- Select the appropriate people and tests for assessing each of these qualities and compare the results of those assessments to what you've decided is needed for the job
	  
	  â€¢   Remember that people tend to pick people like themselves, so pick interviewers who can identify what you are looking for
	  â€¢   Understand how to use and interpret personality tests
	  â€¢   Pay attention to people's track records
	  â€¢   Dig deeply to discover why people did what they did - understanding the why helps you understand that person's values
	  â€¢   Recognize that performance in school, while of some value in making assessments doesn't tell you much about whether the person has the values and abilities you are looking for
	  â€¢   Ask for past reviews
	  â€¢   Check references ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4sd0m0zh29gpdw871gdagd))
		- **Tags**: #[[hiring]]
	- Provide constant, clear and honest feedback and encourage discussion of this feedback
	  
	  â€¢   Put your compliments and criticisms into perspective
	  â€¢   Remember that convincing people of their strengths is generally much easier than convincing them of their weaknesses
	  â€¢   Encourage objective reflection - lots and lots of it
	  â€¢   Employee reviews - the goal of a review is to be clear about what the person can and cannot be trusted with and from there "what can I do about it" can be assessed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4se9n6e2hqvq10t67gdcm4))
		- **Tags**: #[[feedback]]
	- Recognize that sometimes it is better to let people make mistakes so that they can learn from them rather than tell them the better decision
	  
	  â€¢   When criticizing, try to make helpful suggestions
	  â€¢   Learn from success as well as from failure - point out people who are performing a job well so there is a role model to replicate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4sg3efhy43kxr3v69st3cx))
	- Recognize the power of knowing how to deal with not knowing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4sjxynp8ra33wxz7j21hcx))
		- **Tags**: #[[self-awareness]]
	- Understand that the ability to deal with not knowing is far more powerful than knowing
	  
	  â€¢   Embrace the power of asking "What don't I know, and what should I do about it?"
	  â€¢   Finding the path to success is at least as dependent on coming up with the right questions as coming up with answers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4skbt408escj5as6gjr751))
		- **Note**: Dealing with unknowing 
		  The power to ask questions
	- Make all decisions logically, as expected value calculations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4sm9vj7qkc3avfx6hd07db))
		- **Tags**: #[[decision making]]
	- Considering both the probabilities and the payoffs of the consequences, make sure that the probability of the unacceptable (the risk of ruin) is nil
	  
	  â€¢   The cost of a bad decision is equal to or greater than the reward of a good decision, so knowing what you don't know is at least as valuable as knowing
	  â€¢   Recognize opportunities where there isn't much to lose and a lot to gain, even if the probability of the gain happening is low
	  â€¢   Understand how valuable it is to raise the probability that your decision will be right by accurately assessing the probability of your being right
	  â€¢   Don't bet too much on anything. Make 15 or more good, uncorrelated bets ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4smne0zsyz4cpnpgse45rq))

	- Remember the 80/20 Rule, and know what the key 20% is ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4smwa2s9ytnv28wzj0v43w))
		- **Tags**: #[[pareto]] #[[prioritization]]
	- Since 80% of the juice can be gotten with the first 20% of the squeezing, there are relatively few (typically less than five) important things to consider in making a decision ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4snhpag1hrt32ekrktbxyx))
		- **Tags**: #[[pareto]]
	- Think about the appropriate time to make a decision in light of the marginal gains made by acquiring additional information versus the marginal costs of postponing the decision ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4sr83ydfb7nskbd0mmxnmk))
		- **Tags**: #[[opportunity cost]]
	- Remember that the best choices are the ones with more pros than cons, not those that don't have any cons. Watch out for people who tend to argue against something because they can find something wrong with it without properly weighing all the pros against the cons ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4snzhe922rs90y9wzx7z7j))
		- **Tags**: #[[decision making]]
	- When you ask someone whether something is true and they tell you that "it's not totally true," it's probably true enough ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4spnmgqr22ayb0k9ym8276))
	- If your best solution isn't good enough, think harder or escalate that you can't produce a solution that is good enough ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4spz82dfp6k6x6pss3h3kv))
		- **Tags**: #[[compromise]]
	- Avoid the temptation to compromise on that which is uncompromisable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs4sq2vyx5wnxknph327hm6r))
