	- okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by the prospect of actually doing a formal review of The Dawn of Everything. Maybe I'm just going to put some thoughts into this twitter thread. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/greatlakesqueer/status/1478109789712433152))

	- So here's the thing. Much of the content and argument here, I don't disagree with. In fact, as I said yesterday, I've been privately arguing similar things in Indigenous contexts for a decade now and I have the blog posts to prove it.

	- To their credit, the authors do say that they are mostly just trying to stitch together what has been known in smaller circles and make it accessible for larger audiences. Which is not a bad goal. But there are some major issues with the way they do it re: Indigenous people. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/greatlakesqueer/status/1478110484750647296))
	- I would say about 2/3 of this book's evidence is drawn from Indigenous American examples. "The Indigenous critique" (their words) is a major part of their argument. Despite this, there are only 8 citations of Indigenous-written sources, only two of whom are living. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/greatlakesqueer/status/1478111003883802625))
	- They do at one point comment in a footnote that Indigenous writers have been saying this stuff for years and haven't been taken seriously. So why not CITE them? Instead, they overwhelmingly cite white anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians on our history. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/greatlakesqueer/status/1478111543963303939))
	- And although they are trying to show that Indigenous people are not all ~simple band societies~ that can be interpreted as humanity's distant ancestors, there are moments where they come very close to doing just that. Colonialism is mentioned occasionally but often ignored. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/greatlakesqueer/status/1478112024899067912))
	- Ultimately, whether one is compelled by the arguments or not, it is undeniable that this book is systematically built on the exploitation of Indigenous history, while at the same time never engaging Indigenous thinkers today. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/greatlakesqueer/status/1478113255147163650))
	- OR for that matter, acknowledging that Indigenous people might read this book. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/greatlakesqueer/status/1478113742726516739))
	- You can tell that they are completely ignoring all contributions of Indigenous thinkers (and Black thinkers, which I'll talk about in a bit) in the present day with how they talk as though nobody else has pointed out the Enlightenment's creation through colonization. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/greatlakesqueer/status/1478114378960490496))
	- This is also symptomatic of the weird absence of Blackness, Africa, and Black thinkers. Africa appears 1) as the early birthplace of humans (the phrase "we are all Africans" appearsðŸ¤®) and 2) as the 'simplest' form of 'egalitarian foragers' like the Nuer people ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/greatlakesqueer/status/1478115030570778630))
	- they have a footnote about wanting to engage African archaeology more fully in later works, but it's a very glaring absence both in terms of the absence of the history and the absence of the abundant Black thinkers who have raised similar critiques. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/greatlakesqueer/status/1478115394779062279))
	- A few final notes: there's some weird stuff about disability in the Ice Age chapter, and the chapter on state formation should have been an entirely separate book. And then there's the gender stuff. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/greatlakesqueer/status/1478115653945118722))
	- I am not sure what they were trying to do with gender. It does appear fairly regularly, but when they try to draw threads together in the conclusion, they come very weirdly close to saying "it's all about patriarchy" (though they pull back before actually saying that) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/greatlakesqueer/status/1478115919423541252))
	- Of course there is no mention of any gender outside of male or female, but I expected that. The conclusion in general is weird and feels a little coy, because they don't quite answer their own questions. They hint, but the hints are sort of jumbled and confusing (for me at least) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/greatlakesqueer/status/1478116282922848262))
	- And....that's all that is coming to mind right now. Again, I didn't actually hate this book. I agree with a lot of it, in a roundabout way. But ultimately I'm disturbed by the way it builds on top of Indigenous history without any engagement with Indigenous thinkers today.
