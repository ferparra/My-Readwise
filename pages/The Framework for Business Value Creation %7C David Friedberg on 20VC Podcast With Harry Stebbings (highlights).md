document_note:: In this episode of the 20VC podcast, David Friedberg, the founder and CEO of The Production Board, discussed how technology businesses are disrupting the traditional business model, his framework for business value creation, how parenting changed his life, and the flaws of the venture model. He believes that businesses should raise as much capital as possible but can't consistently skip the value creation process with just capital. He and his team at TPB approach building new companies by collaborating with scientists, academics, and engineers and funding their projects on a continuous convertible note cycle. Lastly, they do not prioritize liquidity with regards to exits and are more focused on business value creation.
