	- The 5 criteria for freemium by Slack's @far33d: 
	  
	  1.  Do you have low-cost distribution?
	  2. Is there a fast activation path? 
	  3. Does your product have growth loops? 
	  4. Does your user have purchasing power? 
	  5. Is there a clear value metric?

	- 1. Do you have low-cost distribution? 
	  If not, start by building an acquisition engine 
	  
	  An acquisition engine requires a deep understanding of users: content, competition, cross-company virality

	- 2. Is there a fast activation path? 
	  If not, make onboarding a core priority
	  
	  Free users require fast activation or else they'll churn or remain dormant forever 
	  
	  "Free can attract the wrong users, activate the right ones ASAP" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1198383454963945472))
	- 3. Does your product have growth loops? 
	  If not, expand into multi-player features 
	  
	  Build features that enable collaboration, cross-team visibility and unlock value for managers 
	  
	  "Teams are inherently collaborative, but we have to productize it." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1198383455832166402))
	- 4. Does your user have purchasing power? 
	  
	  If yes, remove as much friction as possible
	- 5. Is there a clear value metric? 
	  
	  Determine your first value metric and create a conversion at this moment
	  
	  Value should increase over time, but start you need to start somewhere!
