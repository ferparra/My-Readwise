	- We introduce a system for fine-grained robotic manipulation! ü§ñ
	  
	  What‚Äôs new?
	  * We can control cheap robots to do surprisingly dexterous tasks
	  * New technique that allows robots to learn fine motor skills

	- First, the hardware:
	  We use simple puppeteering. Just copy the joint angles from the leader to the follower robot.
	  
	  No tactile or force feedback.
	  
	  The manufacturer (@trossenrobotics) didn‚Äôt know these tasks were possible. https://t.co/OonfUnLXyc ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chelseabfinn/status/1640399379004784641))
	- Can the robot do all this on its own?
	  
	  We train the robot to predict actions in chunks, rather than one at a time.
	  
	  Recipe: action chunking + transformers + only 50 demonstrations
	  
	  The robot *autonomously* completes fine manipulation skills. ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/x57dGirzl0 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chelseabfinn/status/1640399387993178112))
