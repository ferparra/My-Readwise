document_note:: The P vs NP problem is a core concept in Computational Complexity which deals with the difficulty of certain problems scaling as they get harder. An example of this can be seen when comparing the difficulty of multiplying two 3-digit numbers to multiplying two 6-digit numbers. In the former case, an algorithm can easily solve the problem in a short amount of time, while in the latter case it will take much longer. Problems in the P class are easy to solve and verify, while NP problems are hard to solve yet easy to verify. EXP problems are hard to solve and hard to verify. Finding a solution to an NP problem would have huge implications, from encryption/security to computational biology. Thus, P vs NP is an important question to answer. Artificial Intelligence systems are a way of approximating solutions to these hard to solve problems.

- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Mar 25th, 2023]]
	- **Verifiability**, the act of being able to prove the correctness of an answer, turned out to be just as important as being able to generate the answer itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw9gggbfey4k8kt72qg9ccar))
	- **P** is a class of problems that are **easy to solve** and **easy to verify**. For the sake of simplicity we can define “easiness” as: being solvable in a [reasonable amount of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_(complexity)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw9ggnwtceft6atnbbsa6jae))
	- **NP**, on the other hand, is a class of problems that are **hard to solve** yet **easy to verify**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw9ggvcf3mqc92hjpqgrbjw0))
	- **EXP** is a class of problems that are **hard to solve** and **hard to verify.** A classic example of an EXP problem would be a generic chess game. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw9ggzm5bvdkdprdgcnqb05t))
