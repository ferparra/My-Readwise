	- Think of this list as a toolkit.

	  Let's dive in: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1593405643834138625))
	- 1. Tips
	  
	  Take your idea and make it easier for the reader to implement.
	  
	  Bonus points for focusing on helping them do it: 
	  
	  • Faster
	  • For less money
	  • With less effort
	  • With less headache
	  • With a higher chance of success
	  
	  Impossible to go wrong focusing on these outcomes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1593405646971338752))
	- 2. Stats
	  
	  People love numbers.
	  
	  Sure, 95% of stats are made up (like this one).
	  
	  But, if you can:
	  
	  • Make a point
	  • Find a unique, true stat
	  • Use it to support your point
	  
	  You will gain massive reader trust. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1593405650188795904))
	- 3. Steps
	  
	  The human brain loves a complete picture.
	  
	  • Take a problem you've solved
	  • Reverse engineer the way you solved it
	  • Give it to the reader in a step-by-step checklist
	  
	  Let the reader know that the outcome they're looking for is *literally* a few steps away. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1593405653308960768))
	- 4. Stories
	  
	  Think about the core ideas that guide your life.
	  
	  Chances are, you have a personal story that helps you remember it.
	  
	  Or, the person who taught it to you gave you a story to remember it.
	  
	  Humans have learned in stories for ages—use them to make your point memorable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1593405656492449794))
	- 5. Quotes
	  
	  The truth is, there is very little original thinking.
	  
	  The best thinking has already been done—and the quotes that have survived long enough to become cliché do a better job at supporting a point than you will.
	  
	  Use them to package up & support your ideas. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1593405659550257152))
	- 6. Benefits
	  
	  Many readers don't know what they don't know.
	  
	  So, before you try to get them to learn, tell them about the things that will happen *once* they learn.
	  
	  Because the truth is, no one wants to "learn"—they want to change.
	  
	  Be in the outcome game, not the education game. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1593405662477819910))
	- 7. Lessons
	  
	  Here's a proven hack to level up quickly:
	  
	  • Try something
	  • Distill what you learned
	  • Share it with the people behind you
	  
	  This will help you:
	  
	  • Crystallize the lessons (so you learn faster)
	  
	  • Benefit the people behind you (so they learn as well)
	  
	  Win-win. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1593405665359298564))
	- 8. Reasons
	  
	  This one is simple.
	  
	  • Make a claim you believe in
	  • Give the core reasons that you believe in it
	  
	  Why do you do things a certain way?
	  
	  Why does it work (or why doesn't it?)
	  
	  Why should they believe (or why shouldn't they?)
	  
	  Think deeply, then support your thinking. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1593405668353925120))
	- 9. Mistakes
	  
	  There is only 1 shortcut in life:
	  
	  Avoiding mistakes the people ahead of you made.
	  
	  So do your part.
	  
	  • Look at your accomplishments
	  • Share the mistakes you made achieving it
	  
	  Then, give them a roadmap to avoid it.
	  
	  Accelerate human progress! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1593405671369842689))
	- 10. Examples
	  
	  This is the easiest one.
	  
	  • Make a point
	  • Say, for example
	  • Give an example to drive it home
	  
	  For example, I just did it with this tweet. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1593405674435715072))
	- 11. Questions
	  
	  You might not have all the answers—and that's okay.
	  
	  Identify the open areas you're still thinking about (and see if the reader has any insights on it).
	  
	  This takes the pressure of having to be an "expert" while also engaging the audience.
	  
	  Another win-win. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1593405677426413568))
	- 12. Resources
	  
	  Some readers want a full deep-dive—so give it to them.
	  
	  • Books
	  • Ted talks
	  • Podcasts
	  • Blog posts
	  • YouTube videos
	  • Twitter accounts
	  
	  Sift through. the resources that helped you learn—then send the reader in the right direction. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1593405680400027648))
	- 13. Frameworks
	  
	  Last but not least, package up everything above.
	  
	  Lay it all out and give the reader something tangible to walk away.
	  
	  Then, tell them to go immediately apply it.
	  
	  Just like this thread. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1593405683545903115))
