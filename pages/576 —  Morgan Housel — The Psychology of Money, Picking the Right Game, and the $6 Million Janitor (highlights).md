	- The Size of the Fund
	  
	  Summary:
	  At the size that it is, that it's just, its not an out perform any more. That's true with a lot of things, right? I want to say it somehow associated with collaborate fund actually, but i don't know where it began. And think you see that actually in a lot of fields. There's a thing in evolutionary byology called cope's rule. It basely says that organisms get bigger overtime.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  And the stock since then has not done very well. And i think that's almost inevitable, at the size that it is, that it's just, its not an out perform any more. That's true with a lot of things, right? I cant remember where i first heard this expression. I want to say it somehow associated with collaborate fund actually, but i don't know where it began. Which is the size os the strategy. In other words, if you're a fund of funds and you're picking fund managers, part of the calculus is going to be perhaps finding a sweet spot where somebody is not in acet accumulation mode just to earn their management fee. They're not going to be able to buy that amazing 50 million dollar mansion in miami on the management fees just yet, right? So they're still out there to beat the world. So the size of the fund, or the size of the company, or the size of the fill in the blank kind of becomes one of the main parimeters for picking. And think you see that actually in a lot of fields. There's a thing in evolutionary byology called cope's rule. It's not a law, cause it's not very universal. But cope's rule basely says that organisms get bigger overtime. So, you know, if you at the evolution of humans, we used to be half of our height that we were as we evolved over the ears, you get bigger. And you went from like little worms that turned into boa constrictors, like most species, get bigger overtime. So then the question is, why aren't all species just enormous?

	- What Does an Investing Company Need For Long Term Success?
	  
	  Summary:
	  i joined the board room just about six weeks ago. a very diverse board, diverse in terms of gender, race and also just background. One thing that'ss interesting, i do thinkth there is some misconception about what a board member does. A board member's job is not to micro manage the company or it's not even to set, like, the grand strategy for the company. It's really to be an overseer of the company and to kind of be the boss of the executive team.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  It's a very diverse board, diverse in terms of gender, race and also just background. So iti gets a really diverse set of views, an set of opinions within the board room. And then i joined the board room just about six weeks ago. Oh, it's very new, fairly new at this ye. So i have to imagine that there are thousands of people who would claim to have similar macro views or world views to people who are on the board of marquel. None the less, they are not getting the invitation to join the board.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  So how did they explain what they hope you to contribute?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  One thing that'ss interesting, i do thinkth there is some misconception about what a board member does. And the important thing is explaining what a board member does not do, which has run the company. And a board member's job is not to micro manage the company, or it's not even to set, like, the grand strategy for the company. It's really to be an overseer of the company and to kind of be the boss of the executive team, to hire the ceo, fire the ceo and pay the ceo. That's the biggest job of the board. Those are huge responsibilities. There're huge responsibilities. There's a great quote from a guy named lawrence cunningham, who says that being on the board of a large company is corporate america's highest honor and heaviest burden it's easier to focus on the first part and ignore the latter part.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  But yes, it's right, those are huge burdens.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  But i think, and again, i'm speaking with six weeks of experience here. ([Time 0:52:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/63633715-a1df-4f7c-97ed-0fe4430a3dbc))
	- Buffet's Family Life Has Been a Disaster
	  
	  Summary:
	  " buffet has not lived a perfect life by any means. And in a lot of instances, his family life has been a disaster," he says. "That's good to hear that like, everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time in the morning"
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  And he, too is just one of the nicest, kindest, funniest people wh i've met. And most of the time when he and i talk, it's nothing to do about investing. We just talk about life and our kids and our our spouses and what not. So i think most of the people whom i really admire as stors, it's more that i admire just how they've lived their lives and their general life philosophies, and their investing philosophy stems from that thit's true for buffet as well. Actually, there's an interesting thing about buffet, which is that it was so easy to admire him, and still is. But when the book the snowball came out, which is a biography written about buffet by an author named ala schroder, and it came out, i want to say, two thousand nine, something like that, really makes clear the case that buffet has not lived a perfect life by any means. And in a lot of instances, his family life has been a disaster. I think that's the right word to use. It's kind of kind of rude to say that, but i think it's really true.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  In some ways.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  That's good to hear that that like, everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time in the morning. Everyone is human. Everyone deals with the ups and the downs of living a life, and that he's a human. And also that a lot of the reason his family life was troubled at timesus because he has had a singular devotion in life, which was picking the best stocks. And everything else came second to that. Everything from his family on down, came second to that. ([Time 1:07:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3281a699-7aa2-42fa-8e57-e2a95e67de15))
	- Warren Buffet, What Did he Do?
	  
	  Summary:
	  Warren Buffet sold his entire portfolio of airline stocks at a huge loss. He would not have behaved the same way if he had to do it all over again. Warren: It's much easier said than done, even for him.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  He would not have behaved the same way. And it wouldn't have been arrived at purely through logic. The guy is just built differently. Well, here's, here's one counter to that. You're generally right, but here's the counter to this. February of 20 20 rolls around. There's a new virus that's going to rile the world economy. What did buffet do? Do you know the answer to that? What he did? You tell me, you're going to have better read on this. He dumped his entire portfolio of airline stocks at a huge loss. That's what he did.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  And he her as crazy about this two weeks before that, maybe it was a week before it, it was a very short periodof time before he went on samby c when it was starting to look like maybe the market was getting toppy.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  And someone asks him, like, warren, what would you do if the market starts falling? And he says, he laughs, and he says, i i'll tell you what i'm not going to do. I'm not going to sell. Two weeks later, he sold all his airline stocks when when this virus hit. Now you can say that that was actually not a mistake, even though the majority of them have regained almost all of their value. You can say that was not a mistake, because the possibility of a complete catastrophic wipe out, particularly in air lines with cobets, was thers.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  You could say like that was actually the right thing to do.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  But even buffet, in this situation, when the world's starting falling apart, he panicked and he did not buy anything of significant value with big numbers s during that huge market decline, even for him. I'm saying, it's much easier said than done. I had my own story about this in the early days of coved morgan. Could ask you to book mark that, don't lose your place. But i want to interject with the question. ([Time 1:13:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/20cbdece-a431-4403-b44c-1e6e35c5a88a))
	- Is Your View of Success Tough?
	  
	  Summary:
	  It's true for a lot of people, that if they make a hundred inest ments, you're going to make the huge majority of your money on probably five of them. Even among the top names, the best investors, overtime, the majority of the picks that they make do not do very well. I think it just kind of changes how people view success tough. Otherthing you could say is, that's just how capitalism works. And that's true for buffet.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  The otherthing you could say is, that's just how capitalism works.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  And that's true for buffet. It's true for a lot of people, that if they make a hundred inest ments, you're going to make the huge majority of your money on probably five of them. That's true for anyone tit's even true if you're investing in an index fund, that within the index, most of the games are going to come from five % of the companies that you invest in. That's always the case. I think it just kind of changes how people view success tough. Like if your view of success is that every stock that warm buffet or shamoth or jim nos o, all these, like these big name investors, and every time they make an investment, then it's clear that that company's going to be a winner. And that's just not how this success plays out at all. Even among the top names, the best investors, overtime, the majority of the picks that they make do not do very well.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  And the reason that they're so successful is because one or two or maybe five investments they've made are ultra home runs.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  People associate that with venture capital. That's how an n v c. But it's actually true in all stages of investing. The staff that i'll share with you here is that if you look at the russell three thousand index, which is an index of large public stocks in the united states, overtime, from i think, 19 80 to 20 ten, forty % of the stocks in this large cap, like maman pop ([Time 1:20:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/83fc6856-ac3b-4c5e-a283-32dfa90a048c))
	- Is There a Golden Willie Wanka Ticket?
	  
	  Summary:
	  There are certain principles, perhaps that's the best word i can come up with right now, that you could pull from a disney or one of these other examples. I belive it was team out of m i t that developed a system for counting cards in blackjack. And one of the underlying principal slash rules was having sufficient bank roll to continue playing through a string of improbable bad luck. But just putting that aside, you also see the same thing in, say, a book like bringing down the house by a ben metric or metrich.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Because if youwere betting on or hoping to emulate someone who found a golden willie wanka ticket, i don't know how to form a strategy around that, but i would imagine there are certain base principles you can take away if you're looking at whether it's venture, very successfulventure capitalists who have been successful for a long period of time, right? Because you can get really lucky and hit the midas list and look like a genius for a short period of time, but people who just for decades been successful. And there is a selection bias, because the best tend to then see better and better deals first. But just putting that aside, you also see the same thing in, say, a book like bringing down the house by a ben metric or metrich. I apologize, ben, i've forgotten how to say your last name, which was later made into 21 about this. I belive it was team out of m i t that developed a system for counting cards in blackjack. And one of the underlying principal slash rules was having sufficient bank roll to continue playing through a string of improbable bad luck, right? So in terms of bet sizing, there are certain principles, perhaps that's the best word i can come up with right now, that you could pull from a disney or one of these other examples, that could be translated to some type of investment approach that people could begin to wrap their heads around. Anyway, i'm just thinking out loud as we, as we go through this. Now, i always think like when you have these idols in any field, doesn't have to be in investing, you just want to ask, what can you emulate?

	- The Great Depression
	  
	  Summary:
	  Heres is not nessarily a biography, but it's a diary. A lawyer named benjamin roth who, in the 19 thirties, kept a very detailed diary during the great depression. Every single morning, he woke up and e wrote a thousand words in what was going on in the economy. And i think it was unintentionally the best economic book ever written.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  Im gangto ask you some journalism and book questions. Biographies you have recommended most to other people, or given the most to other people, or just recommended or gifted, doesn't have no care, recommended the most.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Well, heres is not nessarily a biography, but it's a diary.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  There is a lawyer named benjamin roth who, in the 19 thirties, kept a very detailed diary during the great depressionand every day, it was just his personal diary, but he just wrote about what was going on in his town. He's from youngstown, ohio. And he just wrote about, like, what his neighbors were going through, how many businesses were going bankrupt, what that did to people's personalities. And his son published it in 20 ten. It's called a great depression, the diary. And i think it was unintentionally the best economic book ever written. For sure. It explains what went on during the great depression in a way that no one else has, because there's no hindsight s in it. Every other book on the depression is hindsight by us. We know how the story ends, and that colors our view of what happened. But benjamin roth was writing in real time. Every single morning, he woke up and e wrote a thousand words in what was going on in the economy and it's so fascinating to read.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  And one of the things that sticks out to me, that's so interesting, is that the half the book, if you change the date from 19 32 to two thousand eight, it fits right in the psychology of what happened back then, of how or thinking have people thought about risk, what they thought about government policy, completely repeated itself in two thousand eight.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  And benjamin roth actually talks about in 19 32, he was like, oh, what's going on to day was exactly what happened in 18 78. It's like all these things repeat themselves so commonly and so frequently. ([Time 1:48:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9fc69036-166c-4651-a7a4-0f6ea48681db))
	- How to Avoid Panic in Moments of Panic
	  
	  Summary:
	  The 19 fifties and the 19 nineties were great economically, but there was a lot to be worried about. If you are only planning for risks that you can think about then ten times out of tenYou're gong to miss the biggest risk that actually hits you. So how do you protect yourself from that? How do you actually become byan hold? I think there's one thing to do here. The takeaway is: Don't ever give up on your dreams.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  So two parts of this. One is that even if you look at the periods that, in hindsight, we think were the greatest that existed, which for most americans is the 19 fifties and the 19 nineties, that's what we remember, is like the golden age of prosperity and happiness and peace. Even if you look at those periods, like in the 19 fifties, kids were doing clar bomb drills under their desks, and there was a lot of pessimism and negativety. Even if we know in hindsight it was great at the time, by and large, they did not know that maybe it was like it was good economically, but there was a lot to be worried about in the 19 fifties. Same in the 19 nineties, which we to day is like all the booming 19 nineties, the bull market. But even like people forget, in 19 94, there was a big, like, interest rate calamity, where a bunch of bond fell like interest rates rows n stock market crashed. And then in 19 98, a big hedge fund went out of business and almost took the whole global economy down with it. Like, there was a lot to worry about during these periods. So how do you protect yourself from that? How do you actually become byan hold? I think there's one thing to do here. There's a friend of mine named karl richards who's a financial adviser. And he is a quote where he says, risk is what is left over when you think you've thought of everything. That's the definition of risk, is, whenever we're done plan and forecasting, everything that's left over that we haven't thought about. That's what risk actually is. And the takeaway from that, the actual practical takeaway, is that if you are only planning for risks that you can think about and you can invision and you can imagine, then ten times out of ten, you're gong to miss the biggest risk that actually hits you.

	- Is There a Difference Between a Fee and a Fine?
	  
	  Summary:
	  A fee is just a price of admission that you pay to get something better. On the other side, like you go to disny land, you pay the fee, and then you get to enjoy the theam markets. I you didn't do anything wrong. Its just, that's the fee. If you can situate your life to where you view a lot of the volatility in investing as a fee instead of a fine, then it just becomes but more palatable. And when the market falls 30%. You're like, ok, i understand this is the fee that i have to be willing to pay in order to do well over a long perid of time. Most people don
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  So that would be one way, theoretically, again, maybe easier on paper than it is in practice, to handle some of the damage control. Could you speak to other ways that people can cio, philosophically, psychologically, prepare themselves for a long hall that is going to be very bumpy? And one of the discussions in the book was, and i'm goigto get the wording off here, but related to accepting the prices you will have to pay up front with a commitment to such a strategy, and the fees that are involved a could you speak to that? And the way that i phrased in the book was understating the differene between a fee and a fine, which seems like they're really similar. But there's a very important difference, which a fine means you did something wrong. Like, shame on you. Here's your speeding ticket. Don't do it ever again. You're in trouble. And a fee is just a price of admission that you pay to get something better. On the other side, like you go to disny land, you pay the fee, and then you get to enjoy the theam markets. I you didn't do anything wrong. Its just, that's the fee. If you can situate your life to where you view a lot of the ups and downs, not all of it, but a lot of the volatility in investing, a lot of the volatility in your career as a fee instead of a fine, then it just becomes but more palatable. And when the market falls 30 %, it's not that you enjoy it, you don't think it's fun, but you're like, ok, i understand this is the fee that i have to be willing to pay in order to do well over a long perid of time.

He's in his early thirties, and he's one of the smartest, most insightful and good writers that come across in years. I'm good friends with him now, and i tell him the story that the first time that i read his blog, maybe ten years ago, i read one paragraph, and after one paragraph, i stopped and i was like, this guy's got it. That's all he needed to read to be like, this guy is smart and he can write, and he'll get it. I was so clear early on. He's one of em. Josh brown, whom i mentioned earlier, who as a c o of rittleswelth management, he's, he's well known and he's on t v all the time. He is one person that i think is as funny as he is smart. And to put those two together in one package is really rare. And that humor is important for understanding the context of these it's so much of it is just like he understands the human side of investing better than almost any one. I mentioned derrick thompson earlier, of the atlantic. He's one of the smartest humans that i know. And he's also maybe like 32 years old, something like that. He's definitely on that list. I think jason swag, whom we mentioned earlier, is probably the grea financial journalist of modern times. I don't think that's an exaggeration.

	- The Optimum Amount of Bolshet in Life
	  
	  Summary:
	  "There's actually an optimal amount of boshet to deal with in life," the author says. "If your tolerance for bolshet is zero, you're not going to make it at all in life." The article was inspired by a flight attendant who lost his mind on a two-hour delay.
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  They just couldn't deal with it. And that that was kind of why they ended up in the mental institution. He said, all these people were the smartest, most creative people w hed ever met, but they couldn't put up, they had no tolerance for the bolshet of the real world. And that, to me, just like brought up this idea that there's actually an optimal amount of boshet to deal with in life. There there's an op if your tolerance for bolshet is zero, you're not going to make it at all in life. Yet, the lesson i took from that was, maybe i should live in a mental institution, at least i can tell you. But that's thousa tha. So thosand i listened to that, and it was like a see, these people could not function in the real world because they had no tolerance for bulshet. The second step from that is there is an optimal amount of bolshe to put up with in life. And that was where this article, the optimal amount of hassel, came from. And i was on a flight many years ago, and there was this guy in pin striped suits who let everyone know that he was a c of some company, and the flight was like two hours delayed, and he completely lost his mind. He was dropping f bombs to the gate agents and just like completely making an ass of himself because the flight was delayed. And i remember thinking, like, how could you make it this far in life and have no tolerance for petty annoyance adelayed flight? And i just think there's a big skill in life in terms just being able to deal with some level of bulshet. And a lot of people don't have that. There's another great quote that i love from f d r, who, of course, was paralyzed and in a wheel chair. ([Time 2:27:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5212eae4-47b6-4fa2-8c5c-99d4b82c08fb))
