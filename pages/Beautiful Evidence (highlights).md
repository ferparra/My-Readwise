document_note:: Beautiful Evidence is a book about how to create and interpret effective evidence presentations, with an emphasis on integrating words, images, graphs, and other visual and textual elements. It provides tools for assessing the credibility of evidence presentations, with the goal of assisting both the producer and consumer in understanding causality, making multivariate comparisons, and examining relevant evidence. The book also promotes the idea of analytical thinking as a metaphor for evidence presentations, and details the six principles of evidence display that should be followed.

	- The principles of analytical thinking (and thus analytical design) are universal - like mathematics, the laws of Nature, the deep structure of language - and are not tied to any language, culture, style, century, gender, or technology of information display.

	- Charles Joseph Minard's data-map showing Napoleon's invasion and retreat of Russia may be one of the best designed diagrams of all-time
	  
	  1.  Principle 1: Comparisons - show comparisons, contrasts, differences
	  2.  Principle 2: Causality, mechanisms, structure, explanation - show causality, mechanism, explanation, systemic structure
	  3.  Principle 3: Multivariate Analysis - show multivariate data; show more than 1 or 2 variables
	  4.  Principle 4: Integration of Evidence - completely integrate words, numbers, diagrams
	  5.  Principle 5: Documentation - thoroughly describe the evidence. Provide a detailed title, indicate the authors and sponsors, document the data sources, show complete measurement scales, point out relevant issues.
	  6.  Principle 6: Content counts most of all - analytical representations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq741ntzz5h49hxrm4fbp0n))
	- A clear sign of cherry-picking is that a report appears too good to be true, provoking consumers of the report to mutter, "It's more complicated than that." Avoid overreaching, slippery language, stupendous conclusions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq74b49tdsgtn0exmyfxvfm))
		- **Note**: A clear sign that someone might be cheating is when a report looks too perfect and it makes people say, "This isn't really true." To be honest, you should not make big statements that might not be true.
