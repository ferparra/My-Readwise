	- .@SnowflakeDB & @databricks confs show we’ve crossed the chasm on a completely new data stack. The real news is in the fine print. 🧵/1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CackF/status/1545086399841325057))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Admittedly, my initial 🥛 half-full reaction: data infra hasn’t changed since @Cloudera Hadoop World 2012. But the mind is a beautiful thing to change. Here’s why mine did. /2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CackF/status/1545086401858789376))
	- The technology innovation by @databricks, @SnowflakeDB & every company present has tipped existing equations re: complexity, time required, and cost in their favor 💪. /3 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CackF/status/1545086403419074560))
	- Observation #1: Centralized data. @databricks and @SnowflakeDB are playing the greatest hits from centralized behemoths like Oracle and SQL Server but perform in a way only possible with the ☁️ /4 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CackF/status/1545086404891271168))
	- .@databricks and @SnowflakeDB will continue eating the other’s lunch – DB w/ SQL/catalog mgmt; SNOW w/ #ML. But the market will expand faster than they can take one another’s share. /5 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CackF/status/1545086406598332417))
	- Observation #2: Closing the loop. Static dashboards were never the point, but serving thousands or millions of concurrent end users is a different, harder problem than serving tens or hundreds of internal users. /6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CackF/status/1545086408074731520))
	- With distributed OLAP, streaming, and rETL, companies can now feed data and analytics into or back into  “data apps,” e.g., @DoorDash showing you live simultaneous menu item views. /7 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CackF/status/1545086409781833728))
	- 👆This emphasis on data apps is positive and moves teams closer to making the right, targeted decision vs. building infrastructure alone. /8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CackF/status/1545086411216326656))
	- Observation #3: OLAP and OLTP. (It used to be “or.”) Once anathema, transactional data can now be stored alongside analytical data in a single place, operating as two but presenting as one. Maybe ETL/ELT retains just the T and we adopt Store/Transform/Query ‘STQ’ instead? 🤔 /9 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CackF/status/1545086412541743109))
	- Observation #4: We now have critical mass behind a representative stack (e.g., @databricks, @SnowflakeDB, dbt). Standardization streamlines development for every company *around the stack. There is a splintering of the layers but standardization around the pillars 🏛️. /10 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CackF/status/1545086413992955904))
	- IVP portfolio example: @montecarlodata, now live with support end-to-end for DB, dbt, and SNOW, and picking up steam 🚆. /11 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CackF/status/1545086415469285381))
	- No wonder expo booths were packed! Final thought: With a splintering of the layers, @SnowflakeDB & @databricks don’t aspire to build everything, nor can they. If we have standardized around them, opportunity abounds in the 99%. /END ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CackF/status/1545086416912146432))
