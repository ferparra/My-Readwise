	- New paper in Science today on playing the classic negotiation game "Diplomacy" at a human level, by connecting language models with strategic reasoning! Our agent engages in intense and lengthy dialogues to persuade other players to follow its plans. This was really hard! 1/5

	- In Diplomacy, 7 players hold private conversations and then make simultaneous moves. The dialogue is used to establish trust and coordinate actions with other players. Here, our agent (green) de-escalates with another player by reassuring them it will not attack them. 2/5

	- We automatically labelled training set messages with predicted moves, and use these as control tokens for the LM. During games, the LM is controlled by actions from a planning system. It tries to be helpful - here it (in blue) suggests mutually beneficial moves a human missed 3/5

	- Each game, it sends and receives hundreds of messages, which must be precisely grounded in the game state, dialogue history, and its plans. We developed methods for filtering erroneous messages, letting the agent to pass for human in 40 games. Guess which player is AI here... 4/5

	- In anonymous blitz Diplomacy games against humans, our agent finished in the top 10%, doubling the average human score. This project was a big collaboration between experts in NLP, game theory and Diplomacy (too many to tag!). Paper here: https://t.co/dwrr3AAJx8 5/5
