	- With the launch of the new #ChatGPT API, I wanted to experiment with language-to-actions, and made a toy app where you use language to build a 3D city! ðŸŒ†
	  
	  This demo is fairly simple but you can imagine eventually just speaking to PowerPoint to auto-build your slides. [1/4] https://t.co/roAlPzaJLy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thejessezhang/status/1631324478314778624))

	- This was made with @threejs and based on the wonderful Github City project by honzaap, which I ported over to React.

	- (2) You have a preset library of functions and the model chooses one or several (or even writes a short script combining them) based on their descriptions.
	  
	  I'll put the demo up on https://t.co/8ihbUBW451 for people to play around with once I clean up the code.

	- As you can tell, even in the demo, the results aren't perfect and the queries are quite slow/unoptimized. I also only made it so that the city is editable.
	  
	  Anyways, this was fun to build and I think it's an exciting use case that many apps will eventually adopt! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
