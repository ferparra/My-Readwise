	- With @LaminiAI:
	  ✅Your LLM outperforms general-purpose models on your specific use case
	  ✅You own the model, weights and all, not us
	  ✅Your data can build you an AI moat
	  ✅Any developer can do it today in just a few lines of code
	  ✅Commercial-use-friendly with a CC-BY license

	- Inspired by pain from tech leaders:
	  💬 “Our team of 10 machine learning engineers hit the OpenAI fine-tuning API, but our model got worse—help!”
	  💬 “I don’t know how to make the best use of my data — I’ve exhausted all the prompt magic we can summon from tutorials online.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realSharonZhou/status/1651989514733383681))
	- Team++: Excited to be growing our team with people who are passionate about making it possible to build LLMs 10x faster and making them widely accessible to empower new, extraordinary use cases. If that’s you, please send your resume and a note ➡️ careers@lamini.ai🤝Diversity👇 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realSharonZhou/status/1651989516339798017))
	- …matters to us! We have more women & minorities than not at @LaminiAI, incl technical and PhD roles. If you're curious, let's get coffee: https://t.co/1gDUjpDFii It’s OK if you don’t feel qualified. Same for me in my life. It’d be an honor to work with you, now or in the future.

	- @divideconcept @LaminiAI @OpenAI @EleutheraI @cerebras @databricks @huggingface @Meta We do have GPT-4 available for auto-prompting though, so you can still use that! :) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realSharonZhou/status/1652055257973952514))
