	- The sad reality:
	  
	  Better models don't help with your job, yet many people don't spend time improving their toolset.
	  
	  For 8+ years, I've been working in Computer Vision, and dealing with images is one of the most painful things I have to do.
	  
	  This tool will 2x your workflow: https://t.co/1lWNIcJon3 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1644309077198245889))

	- Kangas is an open-source tool.
	  
	  You can pip-install it and display your data in a notebook with a couple of lines.
	  
	  Out of the box, it supports image classification, object detection, and segmentation data.
	  
	  GitHub Repository: https://t.co/PpnKVpWdJY

	- Kangas is perfect for debugging the results of your model.
	  
	  You can group, sort, and filter data using Pythonic syntax. Kangas converts these commands to raw SQL.
	  
	  I haven't seen any other open-source project that helps with this! https://t.co/joblkUE9H3 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1644309102787698688))
	- Other things to mention:
	  
	  • Customizable interface
	  • Support many different annotation methods
	  • Integrates with @huggingface and @Cometml
	  
	  You can run Kangas from a notebook, or as a standalone application.
	  
	  (The latter is helpful if you are working with a large dataset.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1644309106063446017))
