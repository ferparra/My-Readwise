- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 25th, 2022]]
	- Within nearly every cell is a **genome**. A genome is the complete inherited instruction set for producing, operating and maintaining a living cell or organism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjp1k9eycnte2m7vcz5sjx5m))
	- molecular products genes encode for are called **proteins** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjp1kzvfncbsayy0vj9aq4nb))
	- Cells are constantly reading and interpreting genes stored within the DNA in order to assemble various proteins. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjp1mcqxzefbkppccm409y52))
	- Each cell type in the body produces a complex ecosystem of proteins that keep the cell alive and executing its specific function. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjp1mms2vps0ff218kw5fpkp))
	- the genome stored within the DNA is the master recipe book containing more than 20,000 different cake recipes (genes) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjp1nxqafzgef4k3z49zz317))
	- Conceptually, you can think of DNA laid end-to-end as a ~3 billion character long string consisting only of 'A's, 'C's, 'T's and 'G's. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjp1pj33xv5rk8zbh6twvsht))
	- DNA is comprised of two complementary sequences known as **strands**. Each base is actually a member of a **base pairs**, whereby nucleotides complement each other uniquely—'A's pair only with 'T's, and 'G's only with 'C's.

	- DNA is broken up into a number of large sequences called **chromosomes** that are tucked into the nucleus. Chromosomes typically come in pairs (one from your father and one from your mother) and are wrapped around proteins called **histones** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjq31d02drxhr8gps3dsg0m0))
	- 22 pairs of **autosomes** (chromosomes shared by both sexes) and a pair of sex chromosomes (XX for females or XY for males ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjq31tgp4sf6dx85m7jrx425))

	- **Cells** are the smallest unit of life and are the building blocks of organisms, from a single-celled bacteria to the [trillions of cells that make up the human body](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002533). Cells are complicated organized structures that take a variety of forms, forming tissues and organs and completing the body's functions.
