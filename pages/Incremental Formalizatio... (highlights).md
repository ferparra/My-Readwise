	- Incremental Formalization Everywhere
	  
	  That's what @tana_inc is really good at.
	  
	  Example from today: I'm working on some things that involve copywriting.
	  
	  I have a framework that I usually follow for this (to collect customer pain points etc.), but first time using it with Tana. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1579524135771725825))

	- Now if I was using Notion, I'd have to do a lot of up-front thinking about the kind of customer pain point database I'd want to create
	  
	  Of if I was using ~Roam-like tools, I'd have to stick with mainly free-form tags with some sort of query, but not structured data
	  
	  Not in Tana: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1579524138422525952))
	- Copy in the first quote from an audience member, slap on a tag "Audience Quote".
	  Copy in more quotes.
	  
	  Hm...I think I need some sort of sentiment summary for each quote.
	  
	  Make a field for it. Fill it out.
	  
	  And so on, and so on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1579524141052354566))
	- After half an hour I didn't just have loads of quotes ‚Äì but I had incrementally built up a really nice flow of semi-structured to structured data that I'll be able to easily reference in the future.
	  
	  Show it as a table, filter it...aah, it makes me happy üòÅ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1579524143606685705))
