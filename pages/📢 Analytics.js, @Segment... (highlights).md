	- üì¢ Analytics.js, @Segment's javascript library is getting an upgrade! Today, we're announcing Analytics.js 2.0 ‚Äî the analytics library designed for site performance, extensibility, privacy controls, and more!! üßµüëá ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/webaficionado/status/1397232868074590217))

	- 1/ 8 years ago we launched Analytics.js to help developers integrate analytics into any web application with one simple API. It was met with a great response on Hacker News and led to the birth of Segment.

	- 2/ Fast forward to today, over 20,000+ companies use a.js across 100,000 websites to collect over 1 trillion events every month. What started off as an open-source project, over the years became the underpinning of modern customer data infrastructure.

	- 3/ During these years, the browser landscape has evolved so much, rewarding websites that load super fast and respect their users‚Äô privacy. We built Analytics.js 2.0 to take advantage of modern web standards and give developers full control over their analytics instrumentation.

	- 4/ The first big benefit of Analytics.js 2.0 is that it‚Äôs significantly faster & lighter-weight, ~70%* smaller than Analytics.js. It takes advantage of things like contingent loading and call buffering to ensure your page loads are blazing fast üöÄ https://t.co/cnusc3mNVV ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/webaficionado/status/1397233604279812107))
	- 5/ In a performance study we ran with a leading B2C marketplace, their website experienced a reduction in Total Blocking Time (TBT) by 66% and reduced page load time by 500ms!‚ö°Ô∏èü§Ø ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/webaficionado/status/1397233770395283459))
	- 6/ The second benefit being, Analytics.js 2.0 introduces a new Event Timeline concept that provides a more extensible architecture. Developers will be able to write client-side plugins that execute at different points in the timeline ü™Ñ

	- 7/ A few examples of these client-side plugins: checking consent preferences before collecting an event, enriching events with additional customer info or context in-flight with middlewares, greater visibility into event delivery metrics after an event is sent, and more! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/webaficionado/status/1397234268846399501))
	- 8/ This new architecture will enable customers to move more of their analytics workloads to the cloud. For example, an analytics tool that requires measuring sessions client-side can collect sessions on the client, while continuing to receive events in cloud mode.
