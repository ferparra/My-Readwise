	- Almost all startups fail.
	  
	  Having backed 3,500 of them, Y Combinator knows why.
	  
	  Here's where founders make the biggest mistakes:
	  
	  (avoid them at all costs) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheLanceSun/status/1571113615801077762))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- — Solving a problem they don’t care about
	  
	  Many startups fail because they simply lose motivation to keep pushing.
	  
	  They pick a problem they thought people might want, or could grow quickly, or sound cool. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheLanceSun/status/1571113618749673476))
	- I learned this the hard way with multiple businesses I started.
	  
	  Some I thought I liked because I daydreamed about how much $ they could make.
	  
	  Those were the ones that failed.
	  
	  When those big obstacles inevitably appeared, I didn't care enough to push through and stick with it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheLanceSun/status/1571113621668921345))
	- — Helping users/customers they don’t care about
	  
	  Twitch had this problem. They didn't love the users who used the platform as it grew.
	  
	  What saved them was refocusing around gaming, something one of the cofounders loved.
	  
	  (I made this mistake too.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheLanceSun/status/1571113624420380673))
	- — Choosing cofounders they don’t know well
	  
	  Startups are so hard that it’s really helpful to have a preexisting relationship.
	  
	  When you have history, it really helps for getting through the hard times together.
	  
	  (I can confirm this. Knowing my cofounder meant trust was baked in.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheLanceSun/status/1571113627268304897))
	- — Not having transparent conversations with their cofounders
	  
	  Typical topics that create drama:
	- These are often hard convos to have in general.
	  
	  Letting them fester into resentment in a high pressure situation makes them even harder.
	  
	  The sooner you have them, the better. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheLanceSun/status/1571113632838328320))
	- — Not launching
	  
	  Many people associate launching with a big splash and being in the press.
	  
	  They’re afraid because they don’t feel ready.
	  
	  But think about when Instagram, Snapchat, or Uber launched.
	  
	  You won’t remember it, and your users won’t either.
	  
	  Launch as soon as possible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheLanceSun/status/1571113635627552771))
	- Until you can get your product in front of customers, you can’t validate whether it solves their problem.
	  
	  It’s better to build a crappier product sooner, and get it out there.
	  
	  For most consumer/B2B markets, it’s often possible to launch a simple product in <1 month. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheLanceSun/status/1571113638559350785))
	- — Not tracking data
	  
	  What gets measured gets improved.
	  
	  Not having data to guide your decisions is flying blind.
	  
	  I think this happens more because of ego than ignorance.
	  
	  It's easy to not want data mucking up your brilliant vision. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheLanceSun/status/1571113641201766402))
	- — Having no idea where their first users will come from
	  
	  This means you chose a problem where you don’t know anyone who has the problem (not even yourself).
	  
	  That makes it impossible to truly understand the problem.
	  
	  If you do it right, your first users come from people you know. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheLanceSun/status/1571113644032954370))
	- — Poor prioritization
	  
	  Many people prioritize sizzle over steak:
	  
	  Press, hiring, conferences, etc.
	  
	  Your priority should always be:
	  
	  1. Building the product
	  2. Getting it to users
	  3. Getting feedback to improve ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheLanceSun/status/1571113646725693441))
	- In short, avoid these founder mistakes:
	  
	  — Not caring about the problem
	  — Not caring about the customers
	  — Choosing cofounders you don’t know
	  — Not being transparent with cofounders
	  — Not launching
	  — Not tracking data
	  — Not knowing any target customers
	  — Prioritizing the sizzle ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheLanceSun/status/1571113649443602432))
	- Care deeply, work transparently with those you trust, and focus on the customer.
	  
	  There's no substitute.
