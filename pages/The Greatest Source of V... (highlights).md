- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- the greatest source of value & wealth creation in the 22nd century could be driven by terrestrial nucleosynthesis... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382218307575809))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- demonstration plasma fusion systems are coming online over the next few years. early design tests of these projects are showing remarkable progress.

	- full-scale systems (coming online next 1-3 decades) will use hydrogen (sourced from pure water) which will be energized into a dense plasma, where the hydrogen nuclei smash into one another, fusing into helium and release more energy than was used to generate the plasma. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382221000269824))
	- the implications of these systems are extraordinary. summarily, we are going to realize truly abundant practically free energy with zero environmental/natural resource consequences. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382222254370817))
	- to generate all the power used on Earth today using plasma fusion systems would use up just ~8,000 gallons of water (a 10x10x10foot cube) per year! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382223491735557))
	- getting to this eve of free energy has required 1000s of breakthroughs (& failures & iterations) in materials science, electronics, computing, etc. much is still ahead but this reality is becoming less theoretical by the year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382224804577280))
	- obvious applications of abundant free energy include terraforming earth (desalination of ocean water, cultivating deserts, + driving biodiversity), decarbonizing the atmosphere, powering all of our machines, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382226058674176))
	- as the 21st century progresses, plasma fusion could be the technology savior of our species and our planet, but it could also be the enabler of previously unconsidered opportunities. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382227300159488))
	- we tend to think about new technologies linearly.. their obvious application solving a problem directly in front of us. but more often than not, the value realized from new tech is its utilization across novel applications. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382228571058178))
	- as we move past the 21st century and plasma fusion, like all technologies, becomes faster, cheaper, smaller, better, its application set will expand beyond its original obvious purpose. to what? well, remember, plasma fusion is fundamentally the system of stars... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382229846106113))
	- in stars, over time, as protons and neutrons and bigger nuclei collide with each other under extreme energy and pressure, bigger and bigger nuclei are formed - all heavier elements (heavier than hydrogen) are formed this way. carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, lithium, nedoymium etc ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382231058210816))
	- produced from the dense energy inside stars that exploded billions of years before the formation of Earth (and were part of our planet's formation), we've always assumed heavier elements here on Earth were fixed natural resources - we can't just make more ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382232266166272))
	- "rare earth elements" (used in batteries & electronics) are very hard to find/mine; phosphorus (a fertilizer critical to growing all our crops on Earth) will be fully mined out of Earth's crust in ~100 years. etc
	  however, in a post-plasma fusion world, things could be different.. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382233444839424))
	- plasma fusion systems should eventually get denser, hotter, more energetic, yielding an ability to not just generate electricity, but to drive collisions of small particles into bigger and bigger nuclei... we could eventually "synthesize" heavy elements here on Earth! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382234656993285))
	- rare would become abundant. this notion of "terrestrial nucleosynthesis" hasn't been discussed much in the context of plasma fusion systems but to me represents one of the greatest next-gen unlocks after abundant free energy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382236225593345))
	- entire industries in the 22nd century could be built around terrestrial nucleosynthesis. prices would be driven down on anything "rare" today, and operators of these next-gen commodity-producing systems could sit at the helm of new economies. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382237437751298))
	- what would our species pursue with abundant cheap heavy elements? that's not clear today, but new technologies would generally be more accessible/feasible; interstellar travel would certainly be easier (atoms on a star ship could be recycled/converted). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/friedberg/status/1492382239895687168))
	- for these reasons, and others (driven by various other science/eng advances), i am optimistic about mankind's ability to survive and thrive through the end of this century and well into the next, at which point, it appears far more than we can imagine today may become possible..
