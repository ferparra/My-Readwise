	- TS-Pattern is over 3K ⭐️ on GitHub now! This is nuts 🤯
	  
	  I started TS-Pattern as an experiment to see how far the type system of #TypeScript could go.
	  
	  Here are 4 of my favorites features I've built into TS-Pattern! 🧵👇

	- First, keep in mind that Pattern Matching is usually a language feature.
	  
	  Trying to make a library as good as native support is challenging! A key aspect of this is type inference.
	  
	  The features I'll talk about have little to no runtime. It's only types! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GabrielVergnaud/status/1564226217427013632))
	- Feature nº1: Type narrowing 🔎
	  
	  TS-Pattern infers a precise type for your input based on the pattern you provide: https://t.co/SSyE46hU0J ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GabrielVergnaud/status/1564226247386865664))
	- Feature nº2: Exhaustiveness checking ✅
	  
	  If your list of patterns doesn’t cover all edge cases of your input data-structure, TS-Pattern is able to tell you what cases are missing to make your branching exhaustive: https://t.co/MbMlGMuHEj ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GabrielVergnaud/status/1564229228882759680))
	- Feature nº3: Select ✂️
	  
	  The `https://t.co/hm76hfPJAh` pattern let you extract a part of your input and TS-Pattern will inject it in your handler with the right type! https://t.co/0OrXNkmxmT ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GabrielVergnaud/status/1564229366287982594))
	- Feature nº4: Matching on unknown inputs 🤔
	  
	  TS-Pattern can help you validate the shape of unknown inputs. You can infer a type from a pattern and use isMatching to narrow your input down in an `if` statement: https://t.co/IG1Noscjyg ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GabrielVergnaud/status/1564229481413414915))
