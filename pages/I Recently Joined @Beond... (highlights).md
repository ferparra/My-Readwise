	- 2/11 Be diligent about your personal goals. Define what is your vision, set up specific and measurable goals, acknowledge your obstacles and think about what you're going to deprioritize. Share with others and find accountability partners. They'll help you get there! #goals ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RafaelDaraya/status/1448732566106918915))
	- 3/11 To create deeper connections, the best approach is to be vulnerable, listen and always try to give more than you take. It's not always possible, but connect with someone thinking about how you can help them and not how you can get something from them. #networking ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RafaelDaraya/status/1448732567507722247))
	- 4/11 Using @RoamResearch improved my note-taking skills and helped me better organized my thoughts and learnings. This + a smart and diligent use of my calendar has boosted my #Productivity ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RafaelDaraya/status/1448732569000894471))
	- 5/11 To tackle a problem, always follow a structured approach. Identify the type of problem (Obvious, Complicated, Complex o Chaotic) and act accordingly. For complicated problems, framing, breaking it down and testing hypothesis to find solutions usually works. #problemsolving ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RafaelDaraya/status/1448732570624090115))
	- 6/11 A clear framework can help you set a strong product strategy. For me, at the moment, is following these basic steps:
	  1. Define a north star
	  2. Define your product principles
	  3. Articulate your strategy
	  4. Plan the execution ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RafaelDaraya/status/1448732571882467333))
	- 7/11 It's important to map and be thoughtful about your product quality metrics. They can conflict with business goals such as growth, so keeping this on top of mind will help you deliver a better product #productquality ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RafaelDaraya/status/1448732573182607361))
	- 8/11 Try to use outcome-based roadmaps to communicate business impact, avoiding timelines and Gantt charts. Easier said than done depending on the stakeholders, but it can give the team freedom to define the best approach to achieve goals instead of focus on specific features ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RafaelDaraya/status/1448732574868721665))
	- 9/11 Process is about improving the chances of a good outcome. It's about raising the floor so that you raise the lowest point. Itâ€™s not about being strict and establishing a ceiling. Design it like a product: focus on the problems you're trying to solve #process ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RafaelDaraya/status/1448732576122867713))
	- 10/11 This is a shoutout to @shreyas: You can use, but don't limit yourself with labels (like "data product PM", "financial services PM", etc.). Focus on developing your product sense. It has basically 3 components: 
	  1. Cognitive empathy 
	  2. Domain knowledge
	  3. Creativity ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RafaelDaraya/status/1448732577335058440))
