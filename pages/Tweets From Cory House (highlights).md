	- How to attract and retain great developers:
	  
	  Pay well
	  Use modern tech
	  Offer flexible hours
	  Provide fast laptops
	  Support remote work
	  Treat people with respect
	  Solve meaningful problems
	  
	  You don't need ping pong, game consoles, or beer taps. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1387025347691130881))
	- Just learned about devcontainers.
	  
	  Declare a Docker image that contains your dev environment. 
	  
	  Benefits:
	  ✅ No need to manually install dependencies
	  ✅ Assures everyone has the same dev environment
	  ✅ Include @code extensions
	  ✅ Automatically runs commands when started ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1483086303348637701))
	- This diagram showcases what makes @remix_run special: 
	  
	  Dataflows include the server. 
	  
	  Loaders pass data to the component. Then, Actions pass data back to the server. 
	  
	  This is unique and powerful. 
	  
	  The result? Less code.

	- Impression: React is getting more complex.
	  
	  Reality: The new React docs contain more nuance. They reflect important lessons from years of use. They encourage combining React with powerful patterns, libraries, and frameworks. 
	  
	  I admire all @dan_abramov hard work on the new docs! https://t.co/eEAWqCZ2HI ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1532849344935866370))
