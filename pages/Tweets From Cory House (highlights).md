	- How to attract and retain great developers:
	  
	  Pay well
	  Use modern tech
	  Offer flexible hours
	  Provide fast laptops
	  Support remote work
	  Treat people with respect
	  Solve meaningful problems
	  
	  You don't need ping pong, game consoles, or beer taps. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1387025347691130881))
	- Just learned about devcontainers.
	  
	  Declare a Docker image that contains your dev environment. 
	  
	  Benefits:
	  âœ… No need to manually install dependencies
	  âœ… Assures everyone has the same dev environment
	  âœ… Include @code extensions
	  âœ… Automatically runs commands when started ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1483086303348637701))
	- This diagram showcases what makes @remix_run special: 
	  
	  Dataflows include the server. 
	  
	  Loaders pass data to the component. Then, Actions pass data back to the server. 
	  
	  This is unique and powerful. 
	  
	  The result? Less code.

	- Impression: React is getting more complex.
	  
	  Reality: The new React docs contain more nuance. They reflect important lessons from years of use. They encourage combining React with powerful patterns, libraries, and frameworks. 
	  
	  I admire all @dan_abramov hard work on the new docs! https://t.co/eEAWqCZ2HI ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1532849344935866370))

	- React in 2014: 
	  âœ…Make SPAs. 
	  âœ…Use create-react-app.
	  
	  React in 2022: 
	  âœ…Make SPAs, native mobile, static, MPAs, and hybrid apps. 
	  âœ…Use Vite, Next, Remix, Astro, etc. 
	  âœ…HTTP via react-query, swr, Apollo, etc. 
	  âœ…Routes via React Router, Remix, Next, Tanstack Router, etc... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1586704800988684288))

	- @edorsey I use @ApiMocking for both local dev and for tests on CI. This way UI tests are fast and predictable. And my mocks arenâ€™t tied to Playwright or Cypress, so I can use them in Storybook, Jest, local dev, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1597966392741236738))

	- Avoid Sprints.
	  
	  Sprints create an arbitrary deadline every x days. This creates estimation overhead, and fosters short-term thinking. ðŸ‘Ž
	  
	  Instead: 
	  1. Break work down into small tickets.
	  2. Estimate future flow by tracking the number tickets completed per week.
	  
	  Simple. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1634175905793732609))

	- Problem: Feature flags are handy, but itâ€™s easy to forget to remove them later. This leads to needless overhead, complexity, and risk.
	  
	  Solution: Write an automated test that fails if the flag still exists after a given date. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1639975667713409030))

	- Over-engineering: 
	  Premature use of microservices/microfrontends
	  Ignoring the rule of least power
	  Premature optimization
	  Excessive abstraction
	  Speculative features
	  100% test coverage
	  Needless flexibility
	  Build from scratch
	  Ignoring YAGNI
	  Gold plating ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1607412976876666880))

	- Why Iâ€™m so excited about Reactâ€™s server components:
	  
	  I can do full stack development with just React. 
	  
	  I donâ€™t need to build REST/GraphQL APIs anymore. I can query the DB from my React server components via SQL. ðŸ”¥
	  
	  An entire layer of code just disappears!
	  
	  Bye bye APIs! ðŸ‘‹ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1650654484865994753))
