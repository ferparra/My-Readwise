	- The RBA Review has just dropped and I give it 5 stars! Thread! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ZacGross/status/1648839310144307200))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- It’s a lengthy document, clocking in at almost 300 pages, but the main thrust is exactly right. 
	  
	  The RBA should have a group of experts setting monetary policy
	  Financial Stability should not be a objective of monetary policy
	  The RBA should be more transparent about its reasoning ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ZacGross/status/1648839623060389889))
	- My optimism about how much reform we would eventually get out of this process waxed and waned over the past couple of years, but this report coupled with the opposition’s solid backing, is about as good a result as I think we ever could have expected.

	- Though for those who were disappointed, one of the recommendations is to have Reviews on a regular basis so we will get to do it all again soon enough! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ZacGross/status/1648839724004691969))
	- One aspect I was (pleasantly) surprised by was the detailed section on implementation. They envisage a legislative process that culminates in a mid 2024 switch to the new set up. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ZacGross/status/1648839962719305728))
	- This increases my expectations that Lowe will be reappointed at least until July next year to help with the transition. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ZacGross/status/1648840007862583297))
	- The Review also digs into the reasoning behind the fateful undershooting of 2016-19 - gratuitous self plug for Gross and Leigh (2022) as core reading on this topic. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ZacGross/status/1648840085046198272))
	- The conclude that “it is unclear from the minutes how much weight the Board placed on these arguments in practice” - which coming from the formal Review into the RBA (which also had access to the board papers) seems like a pretty damning comment.

	- Sidenote before I go back to reading the tome, By a complete coincidence I am giving a seminar on “Optimal Monetary Policy in Australia” at the RBA tomorrow!
	  
	  Seeing an research seminar and news cycle coincide is like witnessing a lunar eclipse - just don’t look at it directly! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ZacGross/status/1648840403377078273))
	- .@ALeighMP once asked the RBA if the Board agreed with every RBA recommendation (ie were a rubber stamp) or whether the amateurs ever overrode the staff (not great either tbh!).
	  
	  Seems like for 2016-19 at least the (policy) call was coming from inside the building…

	- Again during the pandemic the Board was present with only one item on the menu.

	- An ongoing theme is that the amateur board were thought to need strong guidance, so discussion of alternatives the executive didn’t prefer weren’t put the to Board, and in turn they didn’t ask for any!
	  
	  Seems like the process was structurally broken. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ZacGross/status/1648844590433325061))
	- Man if tweet out every example of the Board being deliberately kept in the dark I will never get to Chapter 2!

	- This paragraph describes a public focus group, but IMO this misunderstanding is wide spread even among economists. The RBA is not an inflation nutter, nor even an inflation target.
	  
	  It has long had full employment mandate and used it to guide policy (if at times imperfectly).

	- The RBA puts a lot of effort into snappy infographics, but at the end of the day most news is still transmitted via journalists.
	  
	  The practice of off the record briefings isn’t great from a transparency POV, but it’s important that the RBA continue to engage with journalists.
