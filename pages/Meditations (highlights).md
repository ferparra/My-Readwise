	- "The only thing that isn't worthless: to live this life out truthfully and rightly. And be patient with those who don't." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs65hwcrevn44vc564hcwygd))
	- "External things are not the problem. It's your assessment of them. Which you can erase right now." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs65j6dqwjnr4bk16646v43j))
	- "It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs65jckkjeyt9acdwmqex1s4))
	- The questions *Meditations* tries to answer are primarily metaphysical and ethical ones: Why are we here? How should we live our lives? How can we ensure that we do what is right? How can we protect ourselves against the stresses and pressures of daily life? How should we deal with misfortune? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs65k00v1zd7z1yw3mrh0y7t))
	- Instead, as if you were dying right now, despise your flesh. A mess of blood, pieces of bone,a woven tangle of nerves, veins, arteries. Consider what the spirit is: air, and never the same air, but vomited out and gulped in again every instant. Finally, the intelligence. Think of it his way: You are an old man. stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish impulses, to kick against fate and the present, and to mistrust the future ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs65m68qpe3b9ke6q1yyr72d))
		- **Note**: Instead of caring only about your physical body, think about what makes up the spirit. It is made up of air, which is always moving and changing. Imagine you are an old man and don't let your mind be controlled by selfish desires. Don't worry about what has happened in the past or worry about the future.
	- Then what can guide us? Only philosophy. Which means making sure that the power within stays safe and free from assault, superior to pleasure and pain, doing nothing randomly or dishonestly and with imposture, not dependent on anyone else's doing something or not doing it. And making sure that it accepts what happens and what it is dealt as coming from the same place it came from. And above all, that it accepts death in a cheerful spirit, as nothing but the dissolution of the elements from each living thing is composed. If it doesn't hurt the individual elements to change continually into one another, why are people afraid of all of them changing and separating? It's a natural thing. And nothing natural is evil. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs65nngke17jjzc6xhk5k62n))
		- **Note**: We should look to philosophy to help guide us. That means making sure that the power we have inside us stays safe and free from harm, better than anything that could cause us pleasure or pain. We should not do anything dishonestly or randomly, and we should not depend on anyone else to do something for us. We should accept whatever happens to us and accept death as part of life. This is nothing to be scared of because it's natural for the individual parts of us to change and separate. Nothing natural is bad.
	- What's there to complain about? People's misbehavior? But take into consideration: that rational beings exist for one another; that doing what's right sometimes requires patience; that no one does the wrong thing deliberately ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs65wwdeq0f4cxb84yq18jt9))
		- **Note**: Think about why people do bad things. We all exist to help each other, so sometimes it's hard to wait for people to do the right thing. Nobody chooses to do something wrong on purpose.
	- What is "eternal" fame? Emptiness. Then what should we work for? Only for this: proper understanding, unselfish action, truthful speech. A resolve to accept whatever happens as necessary and familiar, flowing like water from the same source and spring ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs65xpk2x71yk03kt0dw9hvc))
		- **Note**: We often want to be famous forever, but that fame is not real. So, what should we work for instead? We should work for understanding, helping others, and being honest. We should also be prepared to accept whatever happens as it is part of life, coming from the same place like water coming from a spring.
	- So there are two reasons to embrace what happens. One is that it's happening to *you.* It was prescribed for you, and it pertains to you. The thread was spun long ago, by the oldest cause of all [Nature]. The other reasons is that what happens to an individual is a cause of well-being in what directs the world - of its well-being, its fulfillment, of its very existence even ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs6600d9yxbjmd6wr8ngqay1))
		- **Note**: There are two reasons why you should accept what happens in life. The first reason is that it was meant for you. Nature made sure that it would happen to you. The second reason is that what happens to a person can help make the world a better place. It can help make the world more successful, more complete and even more alive.
	- Remember: Matter. How tiny your share of it. Time. How brief and fleeting your allotment of it. Fate. How small a role you play in it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs6618j3p8mbfn8bgpdx7f79))

	- Alexander the Great and his mule driver both died and the same thing happened to both. They were absorbed alike into the life force of the world, or dissolved alike into atoms ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs662zqjy47d4zbvc5ay80z8))

	- Nothing has meaning to my mind except its own actions. Which are within its own control. And it's only the immediate ones that matter. Its past and future actions too are meaningless ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs663ch6ezh86e151knarkh4))
	- It's quite possible to be a good man without anyone realizing it. Remember that. And this too: you don't need much to live happily. And just because you've abandoned your hopes of becoming a great thinker or scientist, don't give up on attaining freedom, achieving humility, serving others, obeying God. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs664pnvpy0ywv3cscken5as))

		  Serve God, be free, be humble üôè
	- Give yourself a gift: the present moment ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs6669mpm4mttjaq24dxaanw))
	- To do harm is to do yourself harm. To do an injustice is to do yourself an injustice - it degrades you ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs666qfzrk0c9v5ajvf39wm9))

	- Today I escaped from anxiety. Or no, I discarded it because it was within me, in my own perceptions - not outside ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs6676mkz3vnwxgew5c9pz4v))

	- Your three components: body, breath, mind. Two are yours in trust; to the third alone do you have clear title. If you can cut yourself - your mind - free of what other people do and say, of what you've said or done, of the things that you're afraid will happen, the impositions of the body that contains you and the breath within, and what the whirling chaos sweeps in from outside, so that the mind is freed from fate, brought to clarity, and lives life on its own recognizance - doing what's right, accepting what happens, and speaking the truth... ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs667va8h2ntqadvs3f8szzv))
		- **Note**: Your body, your breath, and your mind are three parts of you. You don't really own the first two, but you do have full control over your mind. If you can separate yourself from what other people think, what you have said or done, and all the things that you fear will happen, then you can make your mind clear and do what is right, accept what happens, and tell the truth.
	- Salvation: to see each thing for what it is - its nature and its purpose ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs6698nghxr9f5xv2adzx991))
