	- @samehueasyou if you think a token will go up in price then should weight your range towards higher prices, as otherwise stop earning fees once moves outside your range. 
	  
	  imagine token A = $10 
	  
	  range might be $9â€”$20 rather than $5-$15 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teo_leibowitz/status/1390785988184641538))
	- @iamDCinvestor set a wide range! 
	  
	  e.g ETH/USDC. hard to imagine it going below 100 any time soon. hard to imagine it going above 1m. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/teo_leibowitz/status/1390803740094078982))
