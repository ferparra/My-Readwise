	- Discovered an interesting data finding on pricing strategy I've coined "The Amex Effect". 
	  
	  It answers where you should price for maximum conversion for consumer and bottoms up B2B. 
	  
	  Also explains why your credit card bill is higher than you thought.
	  
	  Here's the data/findingsðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Patticus/status/1357359700866707459))

	- Just for context, this is from my weekly newsletter. It's like substack, but free and vintage.

	  Ok, let's learn now. 2/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Patticus/status/1357359702401835013))
	- The AMEX effect is the point at which your customer is more than willing to swipe their credit card without much thought or decision-making effort. 
	  
	  Put more simplyâ€”it's the price point at which your target customer won't scrutinize the purchase.
	  
	  Why does it exist? 3/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Patticus/status/1357359704222167044))
	- Us humans are terrible at understanding individual price points, because we think about value as a spectrum. 
	  
	  We know something is worth more or less based on: 
	  
	  1. Anchoring from purchasing previously
	  
	  2. Stack ranking in our heads based on utility. 
	  
	  I know... 4/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Patticus/status/1357359706151469058))
	- A water bottle is worth less than a camera, but if you're in the desert for 3 days without water, that value shifts. 
	  
	  It's also why on the hit gameshow "The Price is Right" the contestants who play games where they have to guess an item is more or less than another win more. 5/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Patticus/status/1357359708286377985))
	- We can measure this in multiple ways, but we want to know in aggregate what's this typically look like and what's it correlate to? 
	  
	  Well, in consumer it seems to be income and in B2B it seems to be seniority. 
	  
	  So what's the AMEX effect for your buyer? 6/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Patticus/status/1357359710006087685))
	- Let's look at consumers first. The below answers: 
	  
	  "At which price would you start to think more about the purchase?" or "For a target customer, at which price will they think the least?"
	  
	  If your customer makes more than $75k, $100 is the answer (or more as income goes up). 7/

	- Something cool: Notice how below $75k there's a hard ceiling at $20 or $50 for a purchase. 
	  
	  This is why made for TV products price at or below these thresholds. . 
	  
	  For affluent folks, the ceilings are loose - you can experiment going higher. 
	  
	  What if you're selling in B2B? 8/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Patticus/status/1357359719019642882))
	- Here's where seniority matters most and the stage of the company (@hiten we chatted about this :)). 
	  
	  This answers - "at what price do they not have to ask someone to approve a purchase? 
	  
	  Manager? $250 or below. 
	  
	  Regular employee? $50 or below. 
	  
	  How do you use this? Well... 9/

	- For bottoms up approach in B2B, I want to go after scaling or established companies at a price at these thresholds or below for my *initial* purchase. 
	  
	  Once you're in, expanding is easy peasy. 
	  
	  If I go over these amounts, I'm going to have friction. 
	  
	  It gets cooler...10/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Patticus/status/1357359725344612352))
	- We took the study further and looked at those who'd used a freemium version of the product and those who didn't. 
	  
	  Those who used free: AMEX effect went up 15-100%. 
	  
	  There's a reason @searchbrat, @markitecht took HubSpot free.  If I love/trust a the product, I'll pay more. 11/

	- We also looked at consumer context - what's the difference in AMEX effect for before filling out a cart and then right before purchase: 
	  
	  People are willing to pay 20% or more.
	  
	  There's a reason starbucks doesn't show pricing in their app until you're ready to purchase. 12/

	- Ok so main takeaways:
	- ...add add-ons without showing the price. This'll be tricky and you'll need to experiment with experience.
	- Anyways, hope this is useful. Lot of work went into this, so if you learned something, please retweet the thread. 
	  
	  Want to spread the knowledge far and wide.
