	  And i'm looking at the way back machine, classic, classic websit is awesome. Caue, you can just go back in time, see any web sigt and what't lookd like at some point in the past. So i got o you know, way back machine, design joy dot co is your web sight. And i can see snap shots from two douseand 19, snapped shots from march two thousand and 20, right? And you are charging, you know, i think this is probably a big part of your success ou ware charging like 400 dollars a month, 495 dollars a month, literally ten times less than youre charg to day. Yo have ten times your customers, right? And make the same amount to day as you're making that. And you have more customers now than you did then. So it's like this kind of explosion. And like the popularity of your web site combined with the fact that you're charging weigh more for what you do, the price increases.

	  Every time i've increased my prices, it hasn't been, i mean, sure, it's to make more money, but the the reaction has always been to stifle growth. As an ontepotunr iont i've never intended to grow tesignjoy d known. I've never had a formal, traditional markting strategy. Never spent an ad on or a dollar on paid ads, anything like that. I've been content with where i'm at, no matter where i'm at. So, yes, every every time that i've increased my prices, i've thought that it'll stifle growth. I've thought that i'll price myself out of a market. And it's a funny thing, because i've been told, especially on indihackers right, lik, i'll propose a problem n ever be like raisor prices, like that's just the common answer, right? Ouow, if youre, if you're overwhelmed and the demand is higher than the supply. So and i always thought this kind of insecurity, part of me didn't want to price myself out and want to make myself too expensive, i thought i'd lose people.
