document_note:: This document discusses the concept of "nudging" people in a positive direction through choice architecture and design in order to improve decisions regarding wealth, health, and happiness. It also mentions how small changes in context can lead to big changes in behavior, while acknowledging the power of default options, heuristics and cognitive biases, and the importance of providing feedback and structure for complex choices. Furthermore, it highlights the role of incentives, group norms, subtle cues, and mnemonics in influencing behavior.
