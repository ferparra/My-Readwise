document_note:: Brian Arthur's precise and fully-modeled papers on increasing returns have caused us to clearly understand the implications of different models and the obstacles to an increasing returns economics. These papers explore the common properties of increasing returns, such as the selection problem, and develop probabilistic methods to solve the problem. The field of economics is resistant to different ideas and approaches, but Arthur's aim was to show that transformation, change, and messiness are natural in the economy. Increasing returns, which are often found in knowledge-based industries, can cause inefficient outcomes and lock-in, but also create opportunities for strategic pricing and learning.

	- Great discoveries tend to come from outside the field ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmkv0v6k0d1zg7ex2k184fd))

	- Diminishing returns, what conventional economic theory is built around, imply a single economic equilibrium point for the economy, but positive feedback - increasing returns - makes for many possible equilibrium points. There is no guarantee that the particular economic outcome selected from among the many alternatives will be the "best" one. Furthermore, once random economic events select a particular path, the choice may become locked-in regardless of the advantages of the alternatives ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmkdp69a4tcnfnhkf9vryda))
		- **Note**: Diminishing returns means that the same amount of effort will always give you the same result. Conventional economic theory is based on this idea, which means that there is usually only one result that a particular activity or situation can lead to. But when there is a positive feedback, meaning that the more effort you put into something the more you get out of it, then there are many possible outcomes. There is no way to be sure which one will be the best one, and once something has been chosen the choice may stay the same even if there are better alternatives.
	- Increasing returns do not apply across the board - agriculture and mining (resource-based portions) - are subject to diminishing returns caused by limited amounts of fertile land or high quality deposits. However, areas of the economy which are knowledge-based are largely subject to increasing returns. Even the production of aircraft is subject to increasing returns - it takes a large initial investment but each plane after that is only a fraction of the initial cost. In addition, producing more units means gaining more experience in the manufacturing process and achieving greater understanding of how to produce additional units even more cheaply. Moreover, experience gained with one product or technology can make it easier to produce new products incorporating similar or related technologies. Not only do the costs of producing high-technology products fall as a company makes more of them, but the benefits of using them increase. Many items such as computers or telecommunications equipment work in networks that require compatibility; when one brand gains a significant market share, people have a strong incentive to buy more of the same product so as to be able to exchange information with those using it already. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmkfpz523t8a56e3fj46xfr))
		- **Note**: Increasing returns are not the same in every area of the economy; in some areas, like farming and mining, the benefits you get back lessen each time you do something. But in areas that rely on knowledge, like making planes and technological products, the more you make the cheaper it gets. This is because you gain experience making the same product over and over and you get better at it. You can also use the same knowledge to make other related products. And when people have the same product, like computers or phones, it's easier for them to talk to each other. So, when one brand of product is popular, people want to buy it so they can connect with each other.
	- Competing technologies, increasing returns, and lock-in by historical events
	  
	  1.  There is an indeterminacy of outcome, nonergodicity (path dependence where small events cumulate to cause the systems to gravitate towards that outcome rather than others). There may be potential inefficiency and nonpredictability. Although individual choices are rational, there is no guarantee that the side selected is, from any long term viewpoint, the better of the two. The dynamics thus take on an evolutionary flavor with a “founder effect” mechanism akin to that in genetics ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmkgnzy52655b61zs942x54))
		- **Note**: When different technologies compete with each other, the one that is chosen may not always be the best. This is because small events (like chance) can add up and make one technology more popular than the other. This process is like a competition, but also like evolution because it is unpredictable and can lead to an outcome that is not the best choice. It’s like the “founder effect” in genetics, where a particular gene is passed down to future generations without changing much.
	- Path dependent processes and the emergence of macrostructure
	  
	  1.  Many situations dominated by increasing returns are most usefully modeled as dynamic processes with random events and natural positive feedbacks or nonlinearities. We call these nonlinear Polya processes and show that they can model a wide variety of increasing returns and positive feedback problems. In the presence of increasing returns or self reinforcement, a nonlinear Polya process typically displays a multiplicity if possible asymptotic outcomes. Early random fluctuations cumulate and are magnified or attenuated by the inherent nonlinearities of the process. By studying how these build up as the dynamics of the process unfold over time, we can observe how an asymptotic outcomes becomes “selected” over time
	  2.  Very often individual technologies show increasing returns to adoption - the more they are adopted the more is learned about them; in then the more they are improved, and the more attractive they become. Very often, too, there are several technologies that compete for shares of a “market” of potential adopters ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmkhrnhsm7mfgzje0mb7jjm))
		- **Note**: Many situations that involve increasing returns can be best understood as processes that involve random events and natural things that make them stronger. These are called nonlinear Polya processes and they can be used to explain different increasing returns and positive feedback problems. When there is an increasing return, this process usually has more than one possible outcome. Small, random things can build up over time and be made bigger by the process itself. When this happens, we can see which outcome becomes the most popular. 
		  
		  Often, when people use a certain technology, the more people who use it, the more people learn about it and it gets better, making it more attractive. Usually, there are several different technologies that people can choose from.
	- Information Contagion
	  
	  1.  When a prospective buyer is making purchasing decisions among several available technically-based products, choosing among different computer workstations, say, they often augment whatever publicly available information they can find by asking previous purchasers about their experiences - which product they chose, and how it is working for them. This is a natural and reasonable procedure; it adds information that is hard to come by otherwise. But it also introduces an "information feedback" into the process whereby products compete for market share. The products new purchasers learn about depend on which products the previous purchasers "polled" or sampled and decided to buy. They are therefore likely to learn more about a commonly purchased product than one with few previous users. Hence, where buyers are risk-averse and tend to favor products they know more about, products that by chance win market share early on gain an information-feedback advantage. Under certain circumstances a product may come to dominate by this advantage alone. This is the information contagion phenomenon ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmkk02x0ha818vc7wqv2xwc))
		- **Note**: When people are trying to decide which product to buy, like computer workstations, they usually ask people who already bought it what their experience was like. This helps them get more information. But it also means that the products that people learn about depend on what products other people bought. So people are more likely to learn about a product that a lot of people have bought than a product that not many people have bought. If people are scared of taking risks, they will prefer products that they know more about. This means that products which have a lot of people buying them early on will have an advantage and could end up being the most popular product.
	- Dynamical systems of the self-reinforcing or autocatalytic type - systems with local positive feedbacks - in physics, chemical kinetics, and theoretical biology tend to possess a multiplicity of asymptotic states or possible "emergent structures". The initial starting state combined with early random events or fluctuations acts to push the dynamics into the domain of one of these asymptotic states and thus to "select" the structure that the system eventually "locks into". ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmkqcdkyz9e89nfmhz8h4c8))
		- **Note**: Dynamical systems are like machines that have different parts. These parts have the ability to create positive feedbacks. This means that the parts interact with each other and help each other to grow. In physics, chemistry, and biology, these systems have many different "end" points, called "emergent structures". When these systems start, the initial conditions and random events can push the system into one of these "end" points. This makes the system "lock" into that one structure.
	- Self-reinforcing mechanisms are variants of or derive from four generic sources:
	  
	  1.  Large set up or fixed costs (which give the advantage of falling unit costs to increased output)
	  2.  Learning effects (which act to improve products or lower their cost as their prevalence increases)
	  3.  Coordination effects (which confer advantages to "going along" with other economic agents taking similar action)
	  4.  Self-reinforcing expectations (where increased prevalence on the market enhances beliefs of further prevalence) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmkpynccqnfc9xtwrj10wpp))
		- **Note**: Self-reinforcing mechanisms come from four different sources. First, there are large set up or fixed costs, which make the cost of producing something go lower when more of it is made. Second, there are learning effects, which means that as products are used more, they get better or cheaper. Third, there are coordination effects, which give people an advantage when they do the same thing as other people. Fourth, when something is more popular on the market, people start to expect it to be even more popular.
	- Besides these 4 properties, we might note other analogies with physical and biological systems. The market starts out even symmetric, yet it ends up asymmetric: there is "symmetry breaking." An "order" or pattern in market shares "emerges" through initial market "fluctuations." The two technologies compete to occupy one "niche" and the one that gets ahead exercises "competitive exclusion" on its rival. And if one technology is inherently superior and appeals to a larger proportion of purchasers, it is more likely to persist: it possesses "selectional advantage." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmkr3tvms78wvtc6xk0ea71))
		- **Note**: The market is like a game with two players. At the start, both players have the same chances of winning. But as the game goes on, one player may get ahead and have an advantage over the other. This is called "symmetry breaking." The players are competing for the same goal and the one that gets ahead can stop the other from winning. If one player is better than the other, it will be more likely to keep winning. This is called "selectional advantage."
	- We can say that the particular equilibrium is locked in to a degree measurable by the minimum cost to effect changeover to an alternative equilibrium. In many economic systems, lock-in happens dynamically, as sequential decisions "groove" out an advantage that the system finds it hard to escape from. Exiting lock-in is difficult and depends on the degree to which the advantages accrued by the inferior "equilibrium" are reversible or transferable to an alternative one. It is difficult when learning effects and specialized fixed costs are the source of reinforcement. Where coordination effects are the source of lock-in, often advantages *are* transferable. As long as each user has certainty that the others also prefer the alternative, each will decide independently to "switch". Inertia must be overcome though because few individuals dare change in case others do not follow ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmks9c7y6f9pt3bfc1ep177))
		- **Note**: In economics, an equilibrium is when everyone is happy with the situation. But sometimes, people get stuck in an equilibrium that isn't the best for everyone. This happens when people keep making the same decisions over and over, which can give someone an advantage that is hard to escape from. It is difficult to change the equilibrium if people have to learn something new or spend a lot of money to switch. However, if people are all coordinated, it can be easier to switch to a better equilibrium. Even so, it can be hard to change the equilibrium because people are scared that others won't switch too.
	- Path Dependence, Self-Reinforcement, and Human Learning
	  
	  1.  There is a strong connection between increasing returns mechanisms and learning problems. Learning can be viewed as competition among beliefs or actions, with some reinforced and others weakened as fresh evidence and data are obtained. But as such, the learning process may then lock-in to actions that are not necessarily optimal nor predictable, by the influence of small events
	  2.  What makes this iterated-choice problem interesting is the tension between exploitation of knowledge gained and exploration of poorly understood actions. At the beginning many actions will be explored or tried out in an attempt to gain information on their consequences. But in the desire to gain payoff, the agent will begin to emphasize or exploit the "better" ones as they come to the fore. This reinforcement of "good" actions is both natural and economically realistic in this iterated-choice context; and any reasonable algorithm will be forced to take account of it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmkm255gtc5m9wwq75qzfz0))
		- **Note**: This passage is talking about how people learn. Learning is like a competition between different ideas or things we do. Some ideas or things will become stronger when we get new information, and others will become weaker. This means that sometimes we lock onto ideas or ways of doing things that might not be the best, just because we keep doing them. 
		  
		  When we are trying to learn something new, we will try out different ideas or things to do. We will start to focus on the ones that are working better for us, because we want to make progress. This makes sense, and it is how real life works. Any learning algorithm that is smart must take this into account.
	- Strategic Pricing in Markets and Increasing Returns
	  
	  1.  Overall, we find that producers' discount rates are crucial in determining whether the market structure is stable or unstable. High discount rates damp the effect of self-reinforcement and lead to a balanced market, while low discount rates enhance it and destabilize the market. Under high discount rates, firms that achieve a large market share quickly lose it again by pricing high to exploit their position for near-term profit. And so, in this case the market stabilizes. Under low discount rates, firms price aggressively as they struggle to lock in a future dominant position; and when the market is close to balanced shares, each drops its price heavily in the hope of reaping future monopoly rents. The result is a strong effort by each firm to "tilt" the market in its favor, and to hold it in an asymmetric position if successful. And so, in this case strategic pricing destabilizes the market
	  2.  The simple dynamics and stochastic model of market competition analyzed in this paper reveals striking properties. First, positive feedback or self-reinforcement to market share may result in bistable stationary distributions with higher probabilities assigned to asymmetric market shares. The stronger the positive feedback, the lower the probability of passing from the region of relative prevalence of one product to that of the other. Second, when producers can influence purchase probabilities by prices, in the presence of positive feedback, optimal pricing is highly state-dependent. The producers struggle for market shares by lowering prices, especially near pivot states with balanced shares. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsmkn96jeaa19ekjttm642ta))
		- **Note**: The market is either stable or unstable and it depends on the producers' discount rates. If the discount rates are high, then the market will be balanced. This means that firms that make a lot of money quickly, will also lose it quickly. But if the discount rates are low, then the firms will price aggressively, trying to get more of the market and make more money. This can make the market unstable. The model of market competition we studied shows that if firms can change their prices, then it can cause the market to be unbalanced. The firms try to get more of the market by lowering prices, especially when the market is equally split between them.
