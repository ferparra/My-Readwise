	- Humans deviate from risk like it’ll will kill them, when in reality, the more common “killer” is staying still.
	- The professional tackles the project that will make him stretch. - Steven Pressfield, The War of Art
	- “Some departments at NASA, for instance, were overhauling themselves by deliberately instituting organizational routines that encouraged engineers to take more risks.

	- effective leadership comes in many forms and often not from those flaunting the title
	- “It’s no longer about finding a career for the rest of your life, but what could you do for the next few years—and what would you learn.”  - Arianne Cohen

	- I encourage others to do this through side hustles or projects that allow them to learn, while also working towards some passion of theirs
	- Anything from developing software to giving gardening advice to running your own nonprofit, such extracurricular activities will help strengthen other muscles—and could make you more desirable to other employers.” - Arianne Cohen
