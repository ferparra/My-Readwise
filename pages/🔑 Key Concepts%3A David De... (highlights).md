	- 1/
	  EXPLANATION
	  The heart of @DavidDeutschOxf's philosophy.
	  
	  Traditional science emphasises predictability: it's about finding testable predictions.
	  
	  Not so, says Deutsch: science is about *understanding* the world, not predicting it.

	  HARD-TO-VARY
	  An explanation is bad (easy to vary) if you can change bits of it and it doesn't make a difference.
	  
	  And it's good (hard to vary) if it's hard to change without messing it up.
	  
	  Every piece matters. It's hard to avoid contradicting our other ideas about reality! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/reasonisfun/status/1434092243598680065))
	- 3/
	  UNIVERSALITY
	  OF IDEAS
	  
	  A universal idea is one that applies to all situations under its scope. It's an idea with reach.
	  
	  A universal language can express *anything*, not just a limited set of ideas.
	  
	  For example, hieroglyphs weren't a universal writing system, but Demotic was. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/reasonisfun/status/1434092245473505284))
	- 4/
	  UNIVERSALITY
	  OF PEOPLE
	  
	  "People are universal explainers" ‚âà people are Turing-complete
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ We can have any thought it's possible to have
	  ‚Ä¢ Nothing fundamental stops us from understanding any aspect of the world‚Äîwe can learn anything
	  ‚Ä¢ We differ in *knowledge*, not intellect ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/reasonisfun/status/1434092247784509440))
	- 5/
	  CREATIVITY
	  Ability to create new knowledge.
	  
	  People are unique in their ability to understand what they're doing and create explanations.
	  
	  Evolution is also 'creative', but it's non-explanatory and limited by dumb trial-and-error given an environment.
	  
	  Nothing else is. (Yet.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/reasonisfun/status/1434092249747492866))
	- 6/
	  OPTIMISM 
	  ‚ùå Things will work out.
	  ‚úÖ All that's needed to make things work out is the right knowledge.
	  
	  The Principle of Optimism: all evils are caused by lack of knowledge.
	  
	  All problems are soluble.
	  Everything is possible, so long as it doesn't violate the laws of physics. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/reasonisfun/status/1434092251794268162))
	- 7/
	  PROPHECY
	  You can't predict knowledge growth: if you could, you'd know it now.
	  
	  Prediction is only possible when creativity won't effect the outcome. Which you can't predict. But you can have an explanation why it won't (eg planets' movements).
	  
	  Many 'predictions' are prophecy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/reasonisfun/status/1434092253564260355))
	- 8/
	  TRUTH
	  All our ideas are false.
	  
	  To be L-true, something must perfectly specify everything relevant, which leads to an infinite regress.
	  Yet we can get closer to the truth by solving problems (correcting errors).
	  
	  The aim is to better understand reality.

	- 9/
	  KNOWLEDGE
	  Imperfect guesses at truth.
	  
	  Candidate definitions:
	  ‚Ä¢ Information with causal power.
	  ‚Ä¢ Information that, once physically instantiated, tends to remain so.
	  ‚Ä¢ Information that is the same across a swathe the multiverse.
	  ‚Ä¢ Useful information. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/reasonisfun/status/1434092257934708740))
	- 10/
	  MEMES 
	  Anti-rational (aka static) memes are entrenched by causing their holders to be unable to criticise them.
	  Typically via coercion, sometimes via the logic of the idea itself + situation.
	  
	  Rational (aka dynamic) memes are spread by being useful and surviving criticism. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/reasonisfun/status/1434092259796992004))
	- 11/
	  HANGUPS
	  A hang-up is a set of ideas that protects itself from criticism.
	  
	  It‚Äôs often a meme, but doesn‚Äôt have to be. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/reasonisfun/status/1434092261789274115))
	- 12/
	  INEXPLICIT IDEAS
	  Explicit ideas are ideas stated in words; inexplicit ideas are everything else.
	  
	  Includes: theories, models, intuitions, skills, feelings, emotions, felt senses, desires, expectations, etc.
	  
	  Inexplicit ideas can always be made explicit, but may be difficult. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/reasonisfun/status/1434092263634833411))
	- 13/
	  INSTITUTIONS
	  Institutions are practices, processes, principles, criteria, or traditions through which you interact with groups, individuals, or yourself.
	  
	  Institutions contain knowledge and are essential for making progress. They are ‚Äòhow to solve this kind of problem‚Äô. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/reasonisfun/status/1434092265648046080))
	- (cont.)
	  
	  There may be cultural relationship institutions, like buying flowers, or specific relationship institutions between two people, like making each other tea.
	  
	  They form context, and sometimes they entirely determine whether an action is right or not. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/reasonisfun/status/1434092267598499840))
	- 14/
	  MORALITY
	  Moral theories are attempted universal principles (for a given a context) to help answer the question of ‚Äúwhat to do next‚Äù.
	  
	  Morality isn‚Äôt:
	- 15/
	  COMMON PREFERENCES
	  A common preference is a solution to a conflict that everyone prefers to their initial preference.
	  
	  Things that can happen:

	  FUN
	  When your explicit and inexplicit ideas agree on what to do.
	  
	  Fun is not:
