		- **Note**: Thread
	- “It's always dangerous for anybody to listen to me because I can be in love with something on Friday and then on Wednesday I'm actually short. And they say, well, Druck said this or that.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1573685874755239940))
	- “Look, I feel the emotion. Don't think I'm dispassionate. I feel the emotion. But I've learned through experience [to] just move on. I would say in action I'm extremely cold blooded, for an investor. But trust me, I'm feeling inside." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1573685876546322433))
	- “I'll never forget my first interview. The guy asked me where I wanted to be in 10 years. And I said intellectually stimulated. I didn't get the job. He thought I was an idiot." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1573685878328811520))
	- "If you love what you do, your work ethic is going to be fantastic. I'm very competitive. Every time you buy, there's a seller on the other side. So you better have done your homework. A lot of this is work ethic but I also think you're going to be better if you enjoy it.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1573685880161722368))
	- Managing analysts.
	  “If you have a great performer, get out of the way. If they're having a difficult time, don't scream at them. 
	  Investing is an emotional business. The last thing you want to do is berate somebody who just emotionally choked. That's when they need support."

	- Working for Soros.
	  "He wasn't that hard to get a job with, but he was hard to keep a job with. And if you didn't perform, he didn't think twice about firing you."

	- "Every big economic problem I've seen is preceded by an asset bubble. ‘29, ‘89 in Japan, ‘07. These guys created the biggest asset bubble I've ever studied. Crypto meme stocks, equities, credit, bonds. This isn't necessarily going to happen, but that's why I'm scared.”

	- “We've never seen the gap we have now between monetary policy and inflation. A lot of my gig is to go back and find historical analogues and see how they worked out and learn from them. This is the most unprecedented cocktail I've ever been served up."

	- "So I have more humility than I've ever had, in terms of a forecast. In fact, my positions reflect that. They're very light. Not because I'm scared, just because I can't see a fat pitch, I can't figure it out." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1573685899514232835))
	- "We've borrowed so much from our future. With corporate profits at an all time high and interest rates presenting a challenging situation, it's just hard for me to envision that we might not be ending the secular bull market." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1573685901393383424))
	- “I'm constantly fighting my bearishness about the world. ... I know that if you have a bearish bias, you have to be very aware of it. You have to work around it. And I always have.”
