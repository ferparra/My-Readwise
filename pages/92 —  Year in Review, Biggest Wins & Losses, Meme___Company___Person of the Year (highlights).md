	  When you use the internet for your work and for like pleasure, personal, you know, it's like a medium for both for so many people now that when I began the journey, they were much more second. They were much more like compartmentalized. And over time, like, they kind of grow together. And there's there's pros to that. And there's also a bunch of downsides to that where am I on my phone? Because I'm working. Am I reading this thing? Because I'm working? Or am I just like being like, I'm just wasting time. Yeah. Yeah. And, and you know, honestly, for me, like, I can always reset it if I just take one day off. So you take one day off. And then the next day you go on it and you're like, your brain actually has time to look at it and process it and say, like, why am I reading this? Like, this is mental that I'm like, looking at this instead of the stuff that is around me. And then like, re like recalibrating to I'm on the phone because I'm operating the business or I'm creating stuff for like, that's going to be relevant for x number of months, years, whatever, like, working on the business as an asset versus like, tricking myself into thinking. And I think everybody probably has some of this. Like, you can convince yourself that even reading this stuff is like work. And in some cases, when you do a podcast about your interests, right?
	  
	  Speaker 4
	  Is like, like, 10 bucks.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I'm going to get writing. I'm going to get to writing once I read these 10 bucks, right? Or I'm going to do the thing after read these 10 bucks. But what is it? It's called exploration versus exploitation. Like, those are the two things when you're exploring your readings. Eventually you have to exploit whatever you're exploring.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  Yeah, man. And, and the, you know, shout out Mooncat 9726, whoever we've been quoting on here, like, a lot of people putting out amazing stuff and entertaining stuff. But I definitely set my scope too wide for a little while. And it just takes a good amount of time to like, pull it back in. And I think that's the same as, you know, the consumption, the level of disparity in consumption, I think, at a certain stage is useful or interesting or in a certain mood is interesting. But then it obviously, if what you do for a living is like, make very specific stuff, the more, not necessarily the more variety, but the more like the further it strays from the things that are fueling your thing, the more it starts to dilute your ability to create great stuff. So be like really hawkish on the information diet is, I mean, so important, so important.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Love that. 100% mate. Yeah, I think the one thing you said there about convincing yourself is easy to convince yourself. Oh, this is part of my job. And honestly, like Twitter. I'm gonna talk about it on the pod. Yeah, yeah.
	  
	  Speaker 3
	  I'm gonna talk about on the pod. So literally could be anything. Yeah, which is a meme hunt in.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Exactly. Now, and that's the thing. In a way, it kind of is, right? Like, because part of like what makes this easy for us to do every week is because it's stuff we would be reading and talking about anyway. And therefore, like literally, my brother-in-law was asking me like, how many hours you work a week on certain things? And I was trying to answer. And I was like, I was like, it's hard to say because do you count the time I was spending 10 hours reading stuff that I would probably read anyway, or the 10 hours a week of random stupid stuff? I've watched and listened to. So it's a really tough one. And I think the way you've described it there is like you need to hone in your focus a little bit more. And then trying what you said about like the writing thing specifically for you because that's your deliverable, right? Like your measuring yourself work-wise on your output as a writer. It just has this. You just have to stop, right? You just have to stop the one point reading. It's unlimited nuggets.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  It's unlimited things. You get shoehorn in there. But yeah. ([Time 0:17:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/68e44c2a-feef-48fd-8d45-dd4d8496a79c))
