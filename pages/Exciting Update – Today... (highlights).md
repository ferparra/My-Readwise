	- Every meeting Iâ€™m in ends with a summary and clear next steps, but I no longer have to write them. Coda AI does the work now.
	  
	  Iâ€™m using this in customer calls, team meetings, and even with Zoom transcripts.

	- I encouraged the team to share where weâ€™re headed early and start opening up the alpha process so makers can start building.
	  
	  Weâ€™re just at the beginning of AI in productivity, and weâ€™d love your feedback along the way as we iterate.
