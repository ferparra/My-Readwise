- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[May 15th, 2023]]
	- Rather than struggle to discover a purpose or vocation, we become people who can recognize and exploit opportunities to create meaning as they arise – resourceful and audacious people who live adventurous lives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0bzv07z6ages2kbqj0gvy94))
	- This means not waiting to find your story arc, but rather recognizing that there are stories that pop up which you can opt into if you recognize them and have the right skills and virtues.  It is about being prepared for the call to adventure, and cultivating the ability to recognize it, rather than believing we can direct our lives from the perspective of some knowable, ultimate mission.

	- “Your class, your caste, your country, sect, your name or your tribe, there's people always dying trying to keep them alive.” – Bright Eyes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0bzvw9vetvt5ctxf030gwfm))
	- Some sources of meaning seem to be:
	  
	  •   participation in something larger that will survive ourselves – a nation, a family, a faith
	    
	  •   creativity and flow states – bringing something genuinely novel into the world.  When all our talents, including our deeply held and latent ones are used, this is more meaningful than when we are schlepping along
	    
	  •   love – when our sense of wellbeing has loci outside of ourselves – friends, family, and lovers
	    
	  •   pro-social utility, or good works – creating a surplus of security and resources that others can use to survive and pursue their own sense of meaning
	    
	  •   an internal sense of coherence, wholeness and dignity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0bzwc56m4w8xjgayntvdt6j))
	- rather than trying to discover a particular arc path and follow it to its conclusion, it recognizes that there will be many different moments and opportunities to create meaning that arise in our life ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0bzwvy8wgrxev56ad8te88e))
	- rather than trying to discern a mission, it is better to become a certain kind of person – a person who is capable of acting on and recognizing opportunities to make meaning when they are seen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0bzxp2d34cnfbw60e2w048m))
	- Trying to treat all of our time as equally meaningful and fungible because it can be devoted to The Cause leads to absurdities ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0bzyh7jk6mwty0c62amd4gk))
	- Time is not fungible – a given moment of opportunity, or a chance to respond appropriately to a crisis, might not occur again.  Our creative powers do not flow smoothly and evenly like water from the tap to the drain, but chaotically like a babbling brook going from the mountains to the ocean – with different shoals, rapids, pools and speeds along the way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0bzz23vsqexzsg9w0nn9xbx))
	- Deontology represents the ethics of duty: the floor beneath which we must not sink, if we are to co-operate with others to pursue the goods of survival and flourishing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0c02ragwkshzy8e0fwamh7y))
	- Consequentialism is the ethics of power and emergency, when there are clearly defined stakes which must be traded off against one another. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0c035457qn2a9ntsz8p4565))
