	- On the existential view, to understand what a human being is it is not
	  enough to know all the truths that natural science—including the
	  science of psychology—could tell us. The dualist who holds that
	  human beings are composed of independent
	  substances—“mind” and “body”—is no
	  better off in this regard than is the physicalist who holds that
	  human existence can be adequately explained in terms of the
	  fundamental physical constituents of the universe.
