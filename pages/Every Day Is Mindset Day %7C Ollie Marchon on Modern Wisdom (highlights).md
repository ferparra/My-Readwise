document_note:: This document provides advice on how to become a top performer in life. It suggests finding one's talent and passion and then doubling down on it with hard work to get a seat at the table. It also stresses the importance of networking and communication with those at the table. Additionally, it encourages a narrow and deep approach to business, rather than a wide and shallow one, and emphasizes the importance of listening to constructive criticism while ignoring criticism from trolls or those with bad intentions. Finally, it suggests having a shark mindset and keeping what is working while dropping what is not.
