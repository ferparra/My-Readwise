	- The five phases of Blitzscaling: Family, tribe,
	      village, city, nation
	- blitzscaling is by climbing
	      learning curves faster than others
	- Business model growth factorsMarket size – paying customers, great distribution,
	       fixed and expanding marginsDistribution – leveraging existing networks, viralityHigh gross margins – more revenues lead to more cash
	       on hand which can be put to use, more attractive to investorsNetwork effects – direct, indirect, two sided, local,
	       compatibility and standards
	- No company should have more than 3 to 5 metrics as more tends
	       to lead to confusion.
	- A good way to gauge risk is by thinking through the knowns
	     and the unknowns and systemic risk and non-systemic risk. Therefore, you
	     must act immediately if there’s some big systemic risk, do something short
	     term to solve your problem, note the problem now so that you can solve it
	     later and let it burn (if unknown and non-systemic)
	- Instability and change are the new norm and the only
	     way to thrive is to know that you have to adapt faster than the change
	     around you.
	- It’s important to differentiate between first mover
	      advantage and first scaler advantage. First movers often die but
	      successful first scalers tend to achieve a very powerful position
	- Tolerate bad management. At the beginning it is more
	      important to move quickly than to have perfect organization and processes
	      in place
	- Launch a product that embarrasses you. You don’t want
	      to wait so long until it’s perfect want to get out and see what the
	      market thinks of it
	- You have to listen to your customers. Not only what
	      they say, but you also have to know when to ignore them – must learn to
	      blend data/intuition
