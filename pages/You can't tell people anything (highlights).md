document_note:: The main lesson learned from this document is that people often don't understand a new idea, plan, or technique until they experience it. Even when people are provided with explanations, pictures, and stories, they may not be able to fully grasp the concept without having experienced it. When attempting to teach something new, it is important to find a way to give people a direct experience to help them understand.

The things you say often don’t stick, and the few things that do stick are often distorted. Also, most people aren’t very good at visualizing hypotheticals, at imagining what something they haven’t experienced might be like, or even what something they *have* experienced might be like if it were somewhat different. One of the things I really miss from my days at Lucasfilm is having artists on staff, being able to run down the hall and say, “hey Gary, draw me this picture.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw99vad7g704atrp8gm9hn4t))
