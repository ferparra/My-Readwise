	- Of California's 30,398,249 motor vehicles, just 1.9% (563,070) are electric.
	  
	  Using the state's own estimates, California will need 17 GW of additional electricity to power all those electric cars
	  
	  Diablo Canyon nuclear plant, which the state has tried to shut down, is 2.3 GW

	- The California Energy Commission calculates that the state will require 4.6 GW (min.) of electricity to fuel 7.5M EVs. Hence, to power 29M more EVs it would require a minimum of ~17 GW additional power and likely much more

	- If we need 5.5 GW per 7.5M EVs, then we would need 21 GW of new electricity to power 29M more EVs. And that assumes no increase in population, and no increase in electricity use, including for cooking and heating, even though the state is trying to encourage the latter.

	- So in order for California to have sufficient electricity to power 30M EVs, it will need to build 20 new, full size nuclear plants the size of the nuclear plants the state has been shutting down, or their equivalent. Tough to do with solar since people want to re-charge at night. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ShellenbergerMD/status/1565092456806240256))
	- To produce the same amount of electricity from solar and wind as from nuclear would require 379x and 421x more land, respectively. 
	  
	  That's simply not going to happen because the projects would kill so many threatened birds and desert tortoises that they'd risk extinction.

	- What about importing wind energy from other states?
	  
	  Same problem: "USGS scientists concluded that if anticipated growth in wind energy by 2040 occurs, increased turbine-caused deaths could cut golden eagle populations by almost half over 10 years"
