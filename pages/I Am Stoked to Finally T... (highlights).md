	- I am stoked to finally talk about DAI Wormhole.  ðŸª±ðŸ•³ will allow users to teleport DAI between L2s while being fast, cheap, and secure at the same time
	  
	  Our mission is to make DAI first, truly cross-chain stablecoin.

	- 2/ Okay, so how does it work? First, a user burns DAI on domain A. Then by providing an oracle attestation of the burn, they can mint fresh DAI on domain B. And... that's it!

	- 3/ Under the hood, MakerDAO keepers will ensure that DAI will be really moved between domains and that debt will be settled. The twist is that a single L1 settlement can finalize hundreds of wormholes between L2s in constant time. That's how we get scalability.

	- 4/ To mint new DAI users will use a special vault collateralized by the promise of future DAI delivered via L1. This is secure b/c it relies on Maker Oracles and maximum exposure is managed by the governance voted parameters like the debt ceiling.

	- 5/DAI minting requires MCD moved to a particular L2. We are not there yet but the wormhole mechanism can be used for teleportation between L2s and L1 (aka fast withdrawals). This is exactly what we are going to deliver in the upcoming weeks for our @optimism and @arbitrum bridges
