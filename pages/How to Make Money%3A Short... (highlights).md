	- How to make money: short elitist ridicule.
	  
	  Last decade, you had to short traditional media and adopt social media earlier than others.
	  
	  This decade, you just have to short Wall St & adopt crypto before others.
	  
	  Populism suffuses everything. Adapt or die. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/akshaybd/status/1397512724007899139))

	- Crypto will create a sky hook for India's youth *at scale*.
	  
	  Anyone with a laptop + internet connection can participate in the crypto economy. The success of @0xPolygon, @epnsproject & @robogajesh will unleash a new gen of founders who attract global capital permissionlessly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/akshaybd/status/1397514657867255811))
	- Decade of the plebs! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/akshaybd/status/1397526214252720136))
	- BTW this is what elitist ridicule sounds like.

	- You will see the same with crypto.
	  
	  Literally everyone actually using/developing on it will see its value instantly. Puzzlingly, the commentariat will continue to diss it with FUD from 2014.
	  
	  Our best bet is to think for ourselves. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/akshaybd/status/1397563363618553862))
