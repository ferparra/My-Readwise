	- Male aging timeline:
	  
	  13-17 mentally impaired and danger to self and society. 
	  
	  18-25 know everything and no one can correct you 
	  
	  26 sanity comes in
	  
	  30 physically still feels like 20’s. You’re stronger actually
	  
	  38 or so is when stuff changes
	  
	  40’s are nice if you planned well ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/1593751657078476800))

	- People who say stuff like “I feel better at 50 than 30,” never really hit it hard in 20’s and 30’s. Objectively you’re losing type II fibers and VO2 max and fluid intelligence / IQ points.
	  
	  In that regard “ignorance is bliss.” 😹
	  
	  50 today isn’t what it once was tho, that’s true. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/1593752602382327809))
	- If you look at “happiness research,” for men the 50’s are danger zone. It’s least happy decade. 
	  
	  Often due to life events like divorce, the ordinary tragedies of living also begin to pile up. Friends die or commit suicide. Physical decline hits big as well. 
	  
	  Gotta be ready. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/1593756396423561217))
