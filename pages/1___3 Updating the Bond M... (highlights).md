	- 2/3
	  
	  The total return of the Bloomberg US Aggregate Index, $25T in assets and >12.5k bonds, has lost 9.49% YTD.
	  
	  This is now worse than 1980 (monthly calculation), the year that "scarred" bond investors for a generation.

	- 3/3
	  
	  2021 was worst year ever (red) for the 2yr. This year is far worse.
	  
	  Who buys a 2-year note? Someone with a lot of leverage (carry trade) like a hedge fund or bank.
	  
	  For all three charts, the system is not designed for these kinds of losses. How much more can it take?

	- Ask a bond mgr back to Jan 2021 when inflation was 1.4% what would happen is the Aggregate Index lost 10% in 4 1/2 months.  
	  
	  Answer, “it does not do this.” And they had 45 years of data to back it up this answer.
	  
	  Now it is.
	  
	  Hence, “the system is not designed for this.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1518253246053339137))
	- Adding to my comment above about the system not being designed for this kind of bond market losses …
	  
	  Sure it could have been designed for these kind of losses, but that means accepting leverage, and less profits/year-end bonuses.
	  
	  The pressure to “push it” over rides caution. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1518260211718529024))
