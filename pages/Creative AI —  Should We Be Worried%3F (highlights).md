	  Summary:
	  I think the hardest aspect of this is is You've mentioned We were talking about this a little bit before the show and you mentioned how like In in humanity We take inspiration from people. Yeah, and there's no fine line of like what is pure copying and what is inspiration and I think it's very hard to To compare that to a machine and AI learning and like I don't know where that line is at all. It's fuzzy because basically you could argue that AI if we're trying to make it as close to a human experience as possible Is literally doing it humans do - taking inspiration from things and then making its own thing.

	  Well, if you make the conscious decision to Try to make your own version of that thing. You're gonna find yourself copying parts of that thing But if you sort of subconsciously might not remember where you remember it from but you kind of have this idea of what you want Something to look like and then you create it you were inspired by all of your previous life experiences everything In your life up to that point has led you to what you are painting How do you give credit to all those parts of your life and maybe some pieces of art?
