document_note:: GPT-3 is an AI-powered tool that can provide the same benefits of traditional journaling, such as creating a written record, never getting tired of listening and being available any time of day. It can also provide additional support beyond traditional journaling, such as summarizing thoughts in new language to help reframe situations, and even guiding conversations toward topics like values. Experiments with GPT-3 have yielded positive results, with people rating it as more helpful than human-generated responses in providing peer-to-peer support. For those who have long journaled, or those who haven't, GPT-3 is an effective tool to try out.
