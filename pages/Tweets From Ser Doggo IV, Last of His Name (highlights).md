	- @aalexis1234 @adamscochran I would say Balancer v2 and Uniswap v3 are really different designs with different needs.
	  
	  Balancer's needs are they want to earn extra yield on the "unused portion" of their pools.
	  
	  Uniswap's design is to eliminate the "unused portion" by allowing people to allocate differently. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fubuloubu/status/1389275725954441223))
	- @aalexis1234 @adamscochran For Balancer, there would be a need for an aggregator like us.
	  
	  For Uniswap v3, the needs are very different. If a lot of liquidity ports over from v2 (and not to alternatives like SushiSwap as v2 deprecates), then custom "narrow band" strategies would be the way to go. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fubuloubu/status/1389276408350920704))
