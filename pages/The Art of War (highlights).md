document_note:: Sun Tzu's Art of War is a timeless classic and its principles are relevant in any field. The commander's role is to find security by understanding their own strength and the enemy's position, and by making preparations against others. The main principles include deception, disguise and diversion, making the enemy prepare against you, and being aware of the terrain, climate, and other factors. Victory can be anticipated, but not forced, and intelligence is key in understanding the enemy and concealing one's own intentions. The goal is to disarm the enemy without ever joining them on the battlefield and to attack strategies, alliances, and soldiers rather than walled cities. Finally, one must remain flexible and anticipate the patterned flow of circumstance to achieve harmony and success.
