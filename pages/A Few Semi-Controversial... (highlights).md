	- Hard work is massively overrated. 
	  
	  *WHAT* you work on is far more important than *HOW HARD* you work. 
	  
	  I'm pretty lazy. But I'm happy and successful.

	- "Most people" do what "Most people" do. 
	  
	  This is a huge mistake.  In the US: 
	  * 50% of marriages end in divorce or separation
	  * 60%+ of the pop. is obese or overweight
	  * 70% of people have less than $1k in savings

	- Creative ppl should NOT work Monday-Friday 9-to-5 (yet 99% do this) 
	  
	  @naval has a great framework. Work like a LION.
	- OK I'll stop there. I'll save the  fully-controversial beliefs for the private newsletter ( https://t.co/hyXkTjtm0Q ) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ShaanVP/status/1364621990385090561))

	- The advice to "be yourself" sounds easy, but is actually the hardest thing you can do in life. 
	  
	  Most people don't like themselves. They don't think they are enough.
