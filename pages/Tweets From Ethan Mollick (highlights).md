	- One of my favorite scientific figures is this one of the entropy levels of 100 world cities by the orientation of streets. The cities with most ordered streets: Chicago, Miami, & Minneapolis. Most disordered: Charlotte, Sao Paulo, Rome & Singapore. Paper: https://t.co/DTd5JiahmF

	- People think startups are a young person's game, but two big papers show this is wrong:
	  1) In the US, the median age for launching a 1-in-1000 fastest growing company is 45 & the average age of founders is 42
	  2) Worldwide, this paper shows older founders outperform younger ones

	- A fact innovation researchers have known for 63 years, but few people seem to actually do: 
	  üö´Don't start brainstorming sessions as a group!
	  ‚úÖStart by writing down ideas on your own. It prevents anchoring & social pressures from ruining divergent thinking. Then go to the group!

	- A former CEO of Hewitt-Packard said, ‚ÄúIf HP knew what HP knows, we'd be three times more productive.‚Äù It turns out that this is a universal issue. There is almost as much difference in management approach across plants within the same firm as across firms! https://t.co/gsploj7nhI

	- A downside of remote work is that we can't casually learn from each other they way we could in an office. The effects of such interactions are huge: Lunch meetings between two salespeople where they discussed sales approaches boosted revenues for both by 24% for months after!

	- A giant study at Microsoft adds to the growing picture of the sudden shift to remote work: the problem is not with existing work & teams; it is the future of organizations. People stop creating new bonds & become more siloed. Bad for innovation & careers. https://t.co/pfHzqYo9Ub

	- Why are the extremely poor so poor?
	  
	  A huge 11 year study in Bangladesh finds: because they don‚Äôt have enough money. It is a much more profound finding than it sounds, because it shows that poverty traps, rather than ability or effort, keep people poor. Giving üí∞ has big returns!

	- The bane of Twitter debates: The Illusion of Explanatory Depth.
	  
	  "People feel they understand complex phenomena with far greater precision, coherence & depth than they really do; they are subject to an illusion." Everyone should read this section of the paper on why it happens...

	- Pseudo-profound bullshit pays off: ‚ÄúMaximizing one‚Äôs skills & competence in a domain is a long & arduous process. However, being able to produce satisfying bullshit that can impress others‚Ä¶ may allow an individual to obtain success in a way that requires much less time & effort‚Äù 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FJp_gAWXMAQX2Mo.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1484639219544899586))
	- Shockingly, mindfulness apps really work. This randomized controlled trial on the Headspace app finds it reduces anxiety and depression by a huge .44 standard deviations after 4 weeks - in the same range as drug treatment & cognitive behavioral therapy. https://t.co/6OVb1hij4L

	- The Overton Window is real. Private beliefs don‚Äôt change fast, but social norms can erode very quickly. When the political environment changes & people perceived an idea that they think is morally bad is actually widespread, they begin to object to it less https://t.co/wjmwgbvyRo 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWnJ5oEWYAAO8kf.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1542986343063633922))
	- An issue with the concept of product-market fit is it conflates many kinds of ‚Äúfits‚Äù that startups need before they can scale, some of which involve factors beyond just sales. For example, the fit between product strategy & business model, or organizational structure & strategy.

	- Love is hard to predict.
	  
	  Using machine learning & tons of psychological variables, this study was unable to predict which relationships will improve (or fall apart) over time. The only factor that mattered was how satisfied the couple is right now, and even that was marginal. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXA4I-cX0AIhfd-.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1544796403469373443))
	- There is a big research stream on the "attention-based view of the firm," showing that the attention of key decision-makers within companies decides what strategic priorities get advanced & what problems get solved. Scattered attention from a CEO or founder can be a real problem.

	- Learning from failure is tricky: This paper studying surgeons shows we learn when others fail, but not when we fail. 
	  
	  We think our failure is just bad luck, but are also in danger of attributing our good luck to skill. A history of wins makes you able learn from your mistakes. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXMNH1JXkAAE5J2.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1545593530533437440))
	- Magic words sometimes work!
	  
	  If you ask for "advice" rather than "feedback," when trying to improve, everything is different. People are bad at evaluating others, but much better at giving advice, so you will get much more actionable & useful information. https://t.co/g0yvSY7IDL 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXMgHhlWIAIJ75A.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1545614652301778950))
	- Doctors, like most of us, could benefit from learning more statistical reasoning.
	  
	  They vastly overestimate the odds of disease before testing, and continue to do so after both positive & negative test results! It held for all diseases, from cancer to UTIs https://t.co/m2WPvbR17h

	- We don‚Äôt recognize how powerful habits are in our lives because we subconsciously justify our habits as rational decisions we choose to make. For example, folks will say they drink ‚òïÔ∏è for other reasons (they are tired), when habit is a better explanation. https://t.co/ku7BhjFIAI

	- Teams need to focus on learning, not just doing. 
	  
	  When teams focus only on getting a job done, they perform worse than teams that also spend time learning from each other. Groups should be encouraged to think about learning for the future, not just on what they are doing now. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FcJhhQ6WQAAHn4f.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1567923007586181122))
	- The whole sad story of audience capture in a paper. Someone who unexpectedly has a post go viral:
	  1. Starts to post more
	  2. Makes their future posts more like the post that went viral, in an attempt to recapture the glory
	  3. Attention usually fades rapidly https://t.co/CIZXVWgsEo

	- They find two great transitions in art styles: From more traditional work (orderly paintings made from the 9th to 19th centuries) to Modern Art (disordered paintings from the 19th and 20th centuries) to Postmodern Art (a return to order after 1950). 2/2 https://t.co/TpZaXcb5ez

	- This is literally true. 
	  
	  This paper shows VC investors who find a surprise unicorn early in their career almost never find another hidden gem‚Ä¶ but the early win gives them a reputation as an insightful investor & thus they get better deal flow forever: https://t.co/dMmmiH8qFF https://t.co/nomI61Q31H 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FdJjltCX0AEL3hV.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1572428722720092160))
	- The secrets of good habits as shown in a study of hand-washing in hospitals:
	  ‚è≥Habits are built over time. See 1st graph!
	  üß†Habits are linked to unconscious cues, like the room we work in
	  ü¶†Habits stay strong until those cues are disrupted, then they break https://t.co/qzjhNwSEp2

	- A reason why old firms are inflexible: When companies have a negative shock (product failure, drop in revenues, etc) one of the ways they get back on track is by implementing standard procedures to solve the problem. But adopting standards lowers future adaptability forevermore.

	- You are going to like this (since I addressed this Tweet to you)!
	  
	  Ideas addressed to "you" are far more resonant across multiple studies. Plus: 
	  üìï26% of the most highlighted Kindle passages are addressed to "you"
	  üé∏Songs addressed to "you" chart more often and are liked better

	- Forget 10x engineers, go for 10x teams. 
	  
	  This paper analyzes 200k teams ranging from sports to politics, and finds that performance follows a power law 70% of the time. So there are a lot of star teams & those teams perform much better than average ones. https://t.co/xdqi9sXzmf

	- The power of metaphor: Thinking of an achieved goal as ‚Äúcompleting a journey‚Äù makes you reflect on how you grew, thus maintaining good habits, compared to seeing it as ‚Äúarriving at a destination.‚Äù Worked for fitness, academics, dieting in both US & Africa. https://t.co/cArnwvAZsX

	- The paper ends with advice: "Abandon the urge to simplify everything, to look for formulas and easy answers, and to begin to think multi-dimensionally, to glory in the mystery and paradoxes of [wicked problems]."

	- Want to boost academic achievement by an amount equivalent to increasing teacher quality by a full standard deviation?
	  
	  Let adolescents sleep in a bit! A randomized study at the Airforce Academy found starting class 50 minutes later had big impacts all day.https://t.co/7cusMhrzUS

	- People dabbling in a new field are overconfident about their expertise: confidence increases faster than knowledge.
	  
	  We start to generate our own theories from the small sample of our experience, but those theories are too simple. As we learn more our confidence actually drops!

	- Power corrupts, but so does powerlessness.
	  
	  Lower power people in organizations are actually more likely to engage in unethical self-promotional lying, mostly because of a need to boost their self-esteem (higher power people tend to lie in order to gain something). 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FfElQFVXoAEDyZ2.jpg)

	- Seven experiments show a secret to meaningful connections: stop assuming the folks you are talking to don‚Äôt want deep conversations.
	  
	  People overestimate how awkward deep conversations will be & avoid them. When they realize others like real talk, they create better relationships

	- If you are out of ideas, go for a walk.
	  
	  This paper found walking (whether outdoors or a treadmill) increased key types of creative thinking for over 80% of undergraduates. The reasons are not fully clear, but there seem to be direct effects on the brain. https://t.co/0EDfpzyf8j

	- The McNamara Fallacy (as coined by Yankelovich):
	  Step 1: Measure what can be easily measured
	  Step 2: Disregard that which cannot be measured easily
	  Step 3: Presume that which cannot be measured easily isn‚Äôt important
	  Step 4: Say that which can‚Äôt be easily measured doesn‚Äôt exist

	- You need an organizational anti-identity. 
	  
	  Leaders know they need to define their organization‚Äôs identity; but it might be even better to define what you are not. Anti-identities are better for pivoting than identities, since they allow more flexibility. https://t.co/pXxFiN4YYP

	- Other games work as effective tests of fluid intelligence: 
	  ‚å®Ô∏èPerformance in MOBAs like League of Legends and Dota correlates with intelligence
	  üéÆPerformance in FPSs like Battlefield 3, Destiny, and (likely) Fortnite don't show the same pattern https://t.co/9DRPoocxr0

	- Cool study of AlphaZero, the chess playing AI, shows that, despite learning ‚ôüÔ∏èwith no human help, its understanding evolved in a "human" way, discovering basic concepts as people do.
	  
	  In fact, a chess grandmaster was able to interpret its learning progress https://t.co/GXQrhs2UKY

	- Founders know that they need to run experiments, but they often don‚Äôt realize that entrepreneurial experiments should be focused on helping you to chose between alternatives.

	- I wrote about four easy things that you can do to make people around you happy. 
	  
	  All of them are backed by research. And all of them seem like small things, but they aren‚Äôt. Which is why the same research shows that we don‚Äôt do them as much as we should. https://t.co/bYbBXNxk3d ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1594832326667927553))
