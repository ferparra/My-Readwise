	- We're bringing the power of the grammar of graphics to Python!
	  
	  And we're doing it in a way that will allow practitioners to plot larger-than-memory datasets on their laptops easily with @DuckDB!

	- @duckdb Why the grammar of graphics? Well, it's simple. The grammar of graphics is the best approach to data visualization APIs. It provides a flexible and intuitive way to build and customize charts, allowing you to create what you need rather than being limited to pre-determined charts ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/edublancas/status/1636374271219089419))
	- @duckdb Now, you may wonder how we can handle larger-than-memory datasets in Python. We're doing this by powering our implementation with DuckDB, a lightweight and efficient database that can handle datasets larger than what can fit into memory.

	- @duckdb Yafim, a member of our engineering team, already submitted a Pull Request, so stay tuned because we're just getting started! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/edublancas/status/1636374273991507974))
