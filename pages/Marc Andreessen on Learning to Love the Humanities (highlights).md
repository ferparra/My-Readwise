	- Hybred Meetings Are the Wrong Idea
	  
	  Summary:
	  There are going to be technological approaches vercial reality, augmented reality, in the future that give you basically the recreation of a physical meeting environment. I mean, these things already exist. Our friend abology is teaching courses right now. An v are in a vertal classroom. Solike these technologies do already exist. That will happen. You know, i think that will be a big deal.

	  What's the main problem that needs to be solved by tech for hybrid meetings or hybrid work places to really succeed over the longer run?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  I'lpick sine section. So that moudbe the kingsman is kind of a funny spine would be spoot. But in the conference room, scenes in there, and all the british agents are meeting around the conference table. And it turns out they're all virtual. The're all wearing their augmented reality glasses, so they're al kind of seeing legrams of each other. You know, there are going to be technological approaches vercial reality, augmented reality, in the future that give you basically the recreation of a physical meeting environment, e only they ardy exist. I mean, these things already exist. Our friend abology is teaching courses right now. An v are in a vertal classroom. Solike these technologies do already exist. That will happen. You know, i think that will be a big deal. Having said that, idon't think that's necessarily the goal or that i don't think that a hybrid meeting is necessarily an equilibrium, or at least a primary equilibrium. I'm not sure if it's something we need to centre in on. And the reason i say that is because when it's a sort of reductive or a ten of looking backwards, which is is to say, we used to have inperson meetings, and now we have some people remote, so now we ned hybrid meetings, you know, is kind of work came backwards from that. There's another way to think about that, which is, well, actually, maybe we shouldn't try to have hybred meetings. Maybe, in fact, hybred meetings are the exact wrong idea. And maybe they're the wrong idea cause maybe, instead of combining the best elements of being local and being remote, maybe they combine the worst elements of being local and being remote. And maybe instead, what we want to do is shift more to the edges, and we want to have of number one, we want to have communication systems and management systems that are really built for remote work, first and primarily.
