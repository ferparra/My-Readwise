	  But having a lot of different so-called species of these micro bacteria is known to be advantageous for immune system function, hormone function. It supports the so-called gut brain axis that's important for a number of things, including mood and motivation. It actually supports the production of neurotransmitters in the brain and body that can help keep you motivated, elevated mood, support the general function of neurons. Well, not surprisingly, there are ways to support the gut microbiome, and there are ways to harm the gut microbiome. I'll refer to the podcast episode we did with Justin Sonnenberg. You can find that at HubermanLab.com if you want to learn all the different ways that you can support your gut microbiome. But for sake of today's discussion, I want to emphasize that some of those methods of supporting the gut microbiome are through the direct consumption of particular foods. And there are two categories of foods that if you're getting enough of them, it's likely that your gut microbiome is diverse and is going to support all those important functions I just listed off and other functions as well. The two sources of gut microbiota supporting foods are low sugar fermented foods. So these would be things like sauerkraut, kimchi, Greek yogurt, again, low sugar, Greek yogurt. Kombucha in particular as a drink, things like kefir, there are a bunch of other varieties of fermented foods, different cultures have different fermented foods, so that Japanese natto is another source of ferment that is very good for the gut microbiome. And work from Justin Sonnenberg's lab and close by labs at Stanford School of Medicine have shown that if people ingest for servings a day of these low sugar fermented foods, it greatly improves the function of the gut microbiome.
