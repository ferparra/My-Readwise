document_note:: In this text, Jonathan Bi and Jim O'Shaughnessy discuss the theories of philosopher Rene Girard, who believes that understanding the mimetic mechanism and scapegoating can help prevent global violence. They also discuss the importance of introspection and meditation to understand the importance of metaphysical desire as the core psychological motor of humanity. Lastly, they note that Girard's theories are only one part of the human psyche, but are still explanatory in many domains.

- The author refers to the historical contingency that we were brought up in and the effect of technology in the last 62 years in order to emphasize the idea that technology can be used for both human flourishing and inflicting human suffering. The author suggests that this is largely due to the fact that the world has been relatively congenial in the past 62 years and technology has been used for positive outcomes, but that this could change in the future and technology could become a tool of mass destruction.
- Will Storr's hypothesis was that when a nation or person is humiliated, it can lead to dangerous consequences, as evidenced by the example of Germany after World War I. After being humiliated by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, a door was opened for the madman Hitler and the consequences that followed.
- The author argues that all of the economic theories they have been taught were fallacious because they do not take into account the role of human emotion in economic exchanges. The author believes that decisions are made emotionally and then rationalized after the fact, which goes against the assumption of Ceteris Paribus that is at the core of many economic theories. Additionally, the author believes that the underlying theory of economic exchanges should be an understanding of human emotions and desires, rather than relying on the "price to magic ratio" that is based on magical thinking.
- The author suggests that modernity has systematically removed spirit from the equation and replaced it with a focus on rational utility maximizing behavior. The author also argues that people are not necessarily just rational utility maximizing creatures, but also spirited creatures concerned with their own social standing and what possessions say about them.
- Girard is considered the rescuer of spirit because he is able to explain the logic behind how people can be irrational, even when they are treated as rational utility maximizing creatures. He is able to show how metaphysical desire, which is a desire for greatness, is a legitimate striving and how people are fundamentally spirited and social creatures, rather than just rational utility maximizing creatures.

	- Let's take a platonic idea of the soul, right? That there is an appetitive part and the appetitivepart of the soul. And if you don't like the word soul, you can just say part of the humannature. Jim O'Shaughnessy:Sure. Jonathan Bi:It goes after sex, it goes after food, animal natures. And then there's the rational partof the soul. And the rational part of the soul is not just about optimizing for sexand food, but it has its own good. And that is truth, reason, right? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gryxapksxw418782j5v2tp2m))

		- **Note**: Let's think about a Platonic idea of a person. There's a part of us that likes to have fun and wants things like food and sex. This part is part of our human nature. But we also have another part that is about finding out what is true and making good decisions. This part is not just about wanting food and sex, but it also has its own important goals.
	- And there's a third part of the soul that
	  
	  is spirit. And this is what the Greeks thought were after Cleos, right? Honor, glory, right?This is what the Iliad and the Odyssey, or at least the Iliad is fundamentally about,whether Achilles, right? Remember because Achilles mom is a goddess. He gives him theprophecy. Either you stay here and you fight on the wall of the Trojans and your physicalbody, appetite, your animal body will perish, but your spirit, your honor, will live forever,
	  
	  or go back home and be a farmer and have your spirit and honor perish, but have your repetitivebody live on for at least a very long time. And what I think, and this is exactly whyI think, what I would agree with you, is that modernity has systematically removed spiritfrom the equation, but also overlooked the end of reason, which is truth. Now everyonejust treats us as rational utility maximizing creatures, right? That is the fundamental
	  
	  assumption. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gryxdyexb2v9r84fp6gzkyqf))
		- **Note**: This passage is talking about the Greek idea of the soul. They believed the soul had three parts: physical body, appetite, and spirit. The Iliad and the Odyssey, two famous Greek stories, are about honor and glory - things that come from the spirit part of the soul. The stories tell the story of Achilles, a hero whose mother is a goddess. He was given a prophecy that said if he stays and fights in the Trojan War, his physical body will die but his spirit and honor will live forever. But if he goes home, his spirit and honor will die but his physical body will live for a long time. Modernity, however, has taken spirit out of the equation and only looks at people as rational creatures who are only trying to maximize their utility.
	- I would recommend you, my professor'swork. I think it's called Struggle for Recognition by Axel Honneth. And you can see this trendalready moving in Machiavelli and Haus, where we gradually lose sight of the spirited partof the soul. But I think, and this is why, in my manuscript, I called Girard a rescuer
	  
	  of spirit to put in other words that I think are quite provocative and interesting, Girardrationalizes, our irrationalities, he's able to describe the logic behind how people areillogical, right? So another way to put this is: if you were to model man as rational utilitymaximizing creature, what you need to do is to overlay Girard on top of it, because he'sinterested in understanding all the ways that people aren't rational, utility maximizing
	  
	  creatures. Okay. So that's a little prolegomena to whatGirard fundamentally sees people as, but what is that logic? Right? That's the next question,what is that logic? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gryxqy6jg65rn41b67rnrps6))

	- n investing,or when you're trying to make a deal, it's not often not really the terms that matter,right? Or the price. I have a friend, he runs a PE shop, and most of the time, and similar
	  
	  with my friend who does M and A consulting, it's not how much money it can give me, butit's, what does this deal say about me compared to that guy over there, or my friend who justsold this company, right? A lot of that is that type of stuff. And Girardactually has a very interesting sort of lens to view capitalism as well. He says, "Don'tbe fooled by capitalistic actors who say that they want to save the world." They're noteven motivated by their own material greed, they're motivated by glory, right? The money
	  
	  doesn't really matter to these people. It's about what that money says about you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz44ntqry6gxsn4pg2fhqkv))

		- **Note**: When people are trying to make a deal, it's not always about the money. My friend who runs a PE shop and my friend who does M and A consulting are not always thinking about how much money they can get, but instead they are thinking about how this deal will make them look compared to other people or their friends who have made similar deals. Some people involved in capitalism say they are trying to save the world, but really they are motivated by glory, not money. It's not about how much money they get, but what the money says about them.
	- Buckminster Fuller, the creator of the geodesic dome, his observation, and I love the waythat he put this. He's like, "I don't think it's that we're discovering or not discovering.I think what it is, is that we humans are either tuned in or not tuned in, or tuned
	  
	  out." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz4nebqg7ab68sdg5rvdapb))
	- Before we invented microscopes,we were tuned out because we had to be. We didn't know it was there. It wasn't that wewere pounding the table and saying, "This is all..." Well, a lot of people were, butwhen we invented that microscope, we got tuned in, right? And in much the same way that whenyou see a new scientific theory, a new literary style, James Joyce comes to mind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz4rdsg6gck2ac6m7jfjhmf))

	- human beings are fundamentally, confabulating unreliable narrators who basically alwayshave themselves starring as the hero in their particular story they're telling themselves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz4wew00r56b1dezxvsppzj))
	- in science, even in what we think
	  
	  to be the most rational sort of domain possible, so much of it is social reasons that thingsget passed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz50chnekr13ck9gkj27kpp))
	- And the example that he likes to give is thediscovery of the first half human, half ape skull in Gibraltar. I think this first skullwas discovered 1848. And so the origin of species came out about 12 years later. And
	  
	  the skull basically just sat there and no one realized any... No one touched it, noone thought anything, no one thought like, "Holy shit, this is a half human half apeskull." Just sat there. And once Darwin's sort of man to ape sortof arc became narratively popular and prestigious, these skulls started popping up everywhere.
	  
	  And what Girard wants this example to show is that we think that science proceeds bygetting new evidence, holy shit, we have a new evidence. We need to reexplain our theoriesto adapt it. And we only accept theories that are sort of validated by evidence, but thatis wrong on both fronts in this example. First, the discovery of that skull didn't do anything.Right? Jim O'Shaughnessy:Right. Jonathan Bi:What did change people was a change in narrative, that Darwin had this interesting narrative
	  
	  that he got from the beaks of birds, but then there was also no evidence for this humanevolution. Right? There was no evidence from sort of apes evolution to man, before thetheory got popular. And once it got popular, people started seeingevidence everywhere. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz52ncsvp3tfet52r0nv3mr))
		- **Tags**: #[[cultural evolution]] #[[science]]
		- **Note**: Girard wanted to show us that science doesn't always work the way we think. He used an example of a skull that was found in Gibraltar that was half human and half ape. Even though it was found in 1848, no one paid attention to it until 12 years later when the origin of species was written. After that, people started to see evidence of human evolution everywhere, even though there was no evidence of it before the theory became popular.
	- we all have blinders on based on what sort of the mimetic narratives that we have. Andthe much more troubling version of this has to be the story with eugenics in the 20thcentury. Right now we consider eugenics to be a pseudoscience or even worse not a scienceat all. But in the early 20th century, it was one of the most prestigious sciences therewas. There was a chair of eugenics in UCL and certain normal laureates, like Herman
	  
	  Mueller and Theodore Roosevelt's political leaders were very supportive of eugenics.Eugenics was at the time grounded upon the latest biology of the day, Darwin.And it actually gave birth to modern statistics. The correlation coefficient was created tomeasure demographic correlations of different human features. And so Girard is just puttingthis out by saying, "Look, don't put too much faith in science. It doesn't even have the
	  
	  power to stop something like eugenics." But perhaps what is worse than the fact that sciencedidn't do anything to stop it, was that the reason we stopped eugenics had also very littleto do with science. It was because it became associated with the Nazis. The Nazis becamethis core evil, and then so everything around it became highly suspicious, right? That'swhy the Italian futurists are also suspicious in contemporary society. And so that this
	  
	  is all to say that even the domain of science, where we think reasons should hold the realm,that's not, at the very least, that's not the entirety of the story. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz5a09pkhpm0t80pefydjce))

		- **Note**: People often have ideas that may not be true but everyone believes them. In the 20th century, one of these ideas was eugenics. Now, we know that eugenics is not a real science or even a good idea. But back then, it was seen as a good science and was supported by important people like Herman Mueller and Theodore Roosevelt. It was based on Charles Darwin's biology and was used to create modern statistics. Science wasn't able to stop eugenics, but something else did. People stopped believing in eugenics once it became associated with the Nazis, who were seen as a very bad group. This shows that even science can be wrong and that sometimes it takes more than just science to make things right.
	- science can also fundamentally distort what evidence we think of as legitimate.In the same way that the Catholic church could say only these canonical books are the word
	  
	  of God. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz5nka8znmxb669fpe4273z))

	- I thinkthat when the humans who have these gods that we create, yes, when we sanctify something,be it science or be it the sky God, that creates the conditions with which you let doctrine
	  
	  enter. And then doctrine becomes untestable, unquestionable. And then to go against doctrineyou have to be a heretic or an apostate, for which most of human history the punishmentwas death. Jonathan Bi:That's totally right. And I think, if I may be heretical now and hopefully I won't die.I think the way that science has exercised its influence and completely ignored a whole
	  
	  series of valid, I wouldn't say evidence, but valid phenomenon, put it in the most broadsense, is that it has mistaken its epistemic limitation for an ontological theory. Andwhat I mean by that, and I'll do a very quick overview here, you can listen to lecture sixwhen it comes out, is that in the beginning, science was contented with investigating the
	  
	  material world, the natural world. And that's what its devices and what its procedures werewell suited for. But then I think science as it became more prestigious got a bit tooarrogant. And then it started mistaking the limitations of its tools, which is usefulto studying external phenomena, material phenomena, and then started saying anything that is notthis is completely invalid. And I think probably the best example hereis the behavioralist in the 20th century. B. F. Skinner, all those folks, which even
	  
	  in the most charitable interpretation thinks that all meaningful things about humans canbe understood by external observable phenomena, as well as how they interact with the externalenvironment. So what is occluded there? I think what was occluded there is introspection,right? Introspection, meditation perhaps, and this is going to draw us even further
	  
	  down, but I think we're lost at this point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz5se4jp29nxm54s6wm8a4h))

		- **Note**: People often create their own gods and when they do, it is like they are saying that thing is special and can't be questioned. In the past, if you tried to go against this kind of thing, you would be punished - even with death. Science has done something similar. It has decided that only certain things are true and all other things are not valid, even if they are real. This means that science has mistaken what it can study and understand for what is actually true in the world. For example, some people think that you can only learn about people by looking at what they do and how they interact with their environment. This ignores how people feel and think about things, which is an important part of understanding people.
	- I've heard about Buddhism and why their cosmology may have stronger epistemic grounds than perhapsChristianity or other religions is that just like we have telescopes, they have a finallytuned to instrument to understand the human soul. And that's through meditation. I'm moreopen to the idea that if you meditate hard enough, and I'm not agreeing with this idea,
	  
	  but I think there's probably something to it, that you can through that introspectionunderstand the truths that you can't otherwise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz5yenp0qct754rw88jzk0w))

	- an overview of Girard psychology. And he basically believesthat there's two strands, two types of desire. One is physical desire and one is metaphysicaldesire. Physical desire aims at the utility of things.Metaphysical desire aims at identity. I can be after, for example, something like sex
	  
	  out of physical desire and that would be the pleasure or the intimacy, experiences in themoment, what the activity and the objects can offer me. Or I can be after it becauseof what having sex with a specific person says about me, right? And this a real psychology,or this is a psychology of the Don Juan or the [inaudible], right? They feel that sortof power. And this extends to numerous domains. And I'll give you another one that ties innicely with the assets. Most of my friends who started off in investment banking now,so maybe 20 years ago, 10 years ago it was different, but who started investment banking
	  
	  now, they're almost solely motivated by metaphysical desire. That is to say they're solely motivatedby what the job says about them. Whereas on the other hand, almost all of my friends inphilosophy are motivated by physical desire, a sort of interest of truth. And the reasonthere is because there is no metaphysical desire for philosophy. It's such a lowly sortof activity these days, you're not going to get that much social validation. And the oppositeis true for investment banking, right? The actual experience of being an investment bankerand being an analyst, I haven't experienced it, but so I hear is not that enjoyable.
	  
	  And so the idea goes something like this, these two strands of metaphysical desire,the desire for being, and this is the one that is much more influenced by the opinionsof others because we want to be seen as existing in great measure in the eyes of others, youcan loosely interpret it like that. And physical desire, these are almost competing for realestate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz669w61enysnsv99dtt1sv))
		- **Tags**: #[[desire]] #[[mimetic theory]]
		- **Note**: People have two types of desire: physical and metaphysical. Physical desire is when we want something because of what it can do for us, like having sex because it gives us pleasure or intimacy. Metaphysical desire is when we want something because of what it says about us, like having sex with a certain person because it makes us feel powerful. Most of Johnathan's friends in investment banking are motivated by metaphysical desire, which is about what people think about them, while his friends in philosophy are motivated by physical desire, which is about truth. People are influenced by the opinions of others when it comes to metaphysical desire because they want to be seen as important. Physical and metaphysical desires compete with each other for our attention.
	- an asset that has a seriesof cash flows attached to it is a very different beast than one that is relying on the, asanother friend of mine calls it, the price to magic ratio.Jonathan Bi: Can you elaborate that a bit? Can you elaboratethat a bit, price to magic? Jim O'Shaughnessy:
	  
	  Yeah, price to magic is essentially where everyone ascribes value to the asset, if andonly if magical things actually occur and magical thinking actually works. Newton, yourexample of his was great because it really underlined the emotional nature of markets.What Newton said was, "I can measure the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of
	  
	  men." Jonathan Bi:Right. Jim O'Shaughnessy:And the other thing that is really interesting that illustrates this idea about what actuallydrives prices for good or for bad was that at the time of the South Sea Trading bubblepeople actually wrote poems about the stock. One of them went, "Fill the South Sea gobletbowl; the gods shall of our stock take care; Europa pleased accepts the Bull, and Jove
	  
	  with joy puts off the Bear." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz6mfewvyr27dksnqfvedss))
		- **Note**: "An asset is something you own, like a house or a car. An asset that has a lot of money that can be made from it is very different than an asset that relies on people believing something magical will happen. People wrote poems to show how excited they were about the South Sea Trading Bubble, which was another asset. The poem said that if you put money into the South Sea Trading Bubble, the gods will take care of it and you will make a lot of money."
	- brings into this idea that human beings are, in my view,wonderful creatures because of their ability to create these myths and legends. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz6sdqtaxy42waecnakp47s))
	- We opened up with Dante so I think it's fitting because you mentionedEuropa, and it's very similar. He's I think going into the metaphysical realm. I think
	  
	  it's the end of the paradise. The third of the comedia. And he's looking back and he'sseeing Odysseus' journeying. And of course in his telling, Odysseus leaves home afterhe goes back to Penelope and he dies, right, his form of transgression, and it's beautifullines of poetry. And it goes, " So that, beyond Cadiz, I saw Ulysses' mad course and, to theeast, could almost see that shoreline where Europa was sweet burden."
	  
	  And what this is supposed to represent is Dante, or one reading of this rather, won'tbe too arrogant here. One reading of this is to see Dante as thinking, using Odysseusas a model because the sin of the Odysseys is transgression, right? He should have leftCirce, but he shouldn't have left Penelope. He should have stayed there. His problem istransgression, wanting to go too far. But of course, that's exactly where Dante is and
	  
	  that's where exactly where he's been for the entire comedia. That he as a living personhas gone through hell and purgatory, and now he's venturing into heaven. And the reasonI brought that up, not only because it connects through Europa of your poem, but I think itis the fundamental question that we're trying to ask now which is, is this mimetic yearning,is that transgression illegitimate, or is that a legitimate striving?And this I think is the fundamental part where I probably disagree with Girard or at leastam not, I think, old enough and don't have enough lived experiences to really go one
	  
	  way or the next. Ask me again in 20 years. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz6yjpqv7v0tk665agwxbes))
		- **Tags**: #[[transgression]]
		- **Note**: Dante wrote about Odysseus, a character from Greek mythology who left home and went on an adventure. Odysseus' sin was that he wanted to go too far. Dante wrote beautiful poetry about Odysseus' journey, and in it he talks about seeing the shoreline where Europa was. This is supposed to show that Dante was thinking about how Odysseus' transgression was wrong, but also that this kind of yearning is a legitimate striving.
	- Girard thinks that metaphysical desire, which elaborate a bit more, is a desire for greatness,to exist in great measure. We want to be eternal, right? [inaudible] denial of death. We wantto be recognized. We want to have glory. We want to be real, a social reality, right?If it doesn't happen on Instagram is it really real? That's the type of reality that we want,
	  
	  a social reality. And we want to be powerful in our relationships. And so it's no surprisethat when Girard uses as patients, if you will, for his psycho analysis, he choosesthe Clausewitz, the Napoleons, the [inaudible] of the world, right, people who want to conquerthe world through word or through sword. One objection here, which is like, is thatreally the psychology of everyone? But the real objection I have or question I have is
	  
	  this drive really bad, right? Because what else does this drive sound like? It soundslike Nietzsche's will to power, right? In fact, an argument one in one of my manuscripts,that it's very, very close to Nietzsche's will of power. And this is where Girard andthe Buddhists agree, right, this fundamental ontological yearning. That's a bad thing.We need to renounce that. But to the best of my knowledge, Nietzsche is the only otherperson who has caught onto this, but has disagreed with that. That this will to power, this endless
	  
	  unsatisfiable, unsatiable drive should be affirmed and should be embodied. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz73ca1zt6734qnw5y1xk90))
		- **Tags**: #[[@nietzsche]]
		- **Note**: Girard believed that people wanted to be great and have a lot of power. We want to be famous and have people recognize us. We want to be real and powerful in our relationships. So Girard studied famous people like Clausewitz and Napoleon who wanted to conquer the world with their power. But some people, like Nietzsche, thought that this drive to be powerful was a good thing, and should be embraced.
	- all the great world historical activity in theworld needs to be motivated from a place of untruth, of delusion. And this is why oneof my favorite essays is Nietzsche's, he wrote a series of essays called The Untimely Meditations.And one of them was called The Uses and Abuses of History For Life. Where he said, "If you're
	  
	  a great man, then only think of history as a series of progeny," almost, "by great men.If you want to be a critical person," or a progressive in these days, "then think ofhistory as a series of injustices. And if you want to be an antiquarian," someone whoprotects history, then emphasize that dimension of the greatness of history.And the idea here is one that concerns with historiography, that history should not bedone objectively, but we should distort truth for our own ends and action. But I think there's
	  
	  an easy equivalent to the sphere of action, right? Almost all the really successful entrepreneurs,almost, that I know are diluted, is too strong and negative a word but I'll use it for theaterif not anything else, that they believe that achieving it will grant them more happinessthan it actually would. It's a false promise. And they also think the thing they're buildingis more important than it probably is. That's one line of thinking is that only by motivatedby this type of delusional self-aggrandizing prideful desire can you really do not good
	  
	  things, not great things, but world historical activity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz7a7m8kam2j5epax2rg40a))
		- **Note**: Nietzsche wrote a series of essays called The Untimely Meditations, and one was called The Uses and Abuses of History For Life. In this essay, Nietzsche said that if you want to do something big and important in the world, you have to be motivated by a false belief or a "delusional self-aggrandizing prideful desire." He also said that successful entrepreneurs think that achieving their goals will make them happier than it actually will, and that the things they are building are more important than they actually are. He believed that only by being motivated by this type of false belief can people do great things in the world.

	- like you're mentioning [[Nietzsche]], I think his idea of [[amor fati]], love your fate,
	  
	  is actually quite actionable and quite a good way to look at life. Because he's not sayinglove your fate, only if it's good, right, he's saying, love your fate, amor fati, whichit brings you back to the Greek spirit and all of that. And that was all part of hisbig Ubermensch thing, right, that kind of striving, right, he viewed as a very, very
	  
	  good thing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz7m564j7ghechvybe983vd))

		- **Note**: Nietzsche had an idea called 'amor fati', which means 'love your fate'. This is a good way to look at life because it means to accept whatever comes your way, good or bad. It also connects us with the ideas of the ancient Greeks, which Nietzsche thought was a very positive thing. He believed that striving for something was a good thing.
	- the idea of introspection, I think very deeply about the importance of
	  
	  that. And it seems to be such a moving target for we humans, because if we're just lookingat empirical results, we tend to be pretty good at judging the deficiencies or assetsof other people. And we tend to really suck at judging our own abilities or assets anddeficiencies, so much so that Tony de Mello, the priest who became enlightened and was
	  
	  tossed out of the Catholic church, they took him back later. But so much so that he goes,"If you want to know your own deficiencies, just look at what bothers you in other people."Because what you're going to do is be very good at that, which led to a theory of tryingto be able to stand outside of yourself as applied to economic theory and art.

		- **Note**: The idea of introspection means thinking deeply about yourself and understanding why you feel certain ways. People are usually very good at understanding the strengths and weaknesses of other people, but they often struggle to understand their own strengths and weaknesses. Tony de Mello, a priest who became enlightened, said that if you want to understand your own weaknesses, look at what bothers you in other people. This can help you understand why you feel certain ways and can also be applied to economic theory and art.
	- one of the purest good examples of memetic theory in action,because as you note, most art has no practical value, i.e. we can't eat it, we can't... It'sa very small fire indeed of the Mona Lisa, and yet it's worth hundreds of millions ofdollars or euros. And that is because of the collective judgment of human desire and what
	  
	  it judges to find value in. That's what I find fascinating, because you can create afortune out of your mind. People can do it in tech companies, they can do it in financecompanies, they can do it in art. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz801segaz12yrz47ksfygx))

		- **Note**: Memetic theory is an idea that people can create a lot of value from their ideas. Most art doesn't have any practical value like food or shelter, but people still find it valuable and it can be worth a lot of money. For example, the Mona Lisa painting is worth hundreds of millions of dollars even though it can't be used to do anything. People can use this idea in tech companies, finance companies, and in art to create value.
	- what's really interesting about Girard's philosophy of history, especiallycoming from a German background, vis a vis Kant and Hegel, is that Girard largely agreesdescriptively with how history has changed, but his normative conclusions of that have
	  
	  completely flipped. So Gellien would say something like truth, reason, equality, have expandedto a time where we're now approaching, or already at, at his time already, the end ofhistory. Where institutions can still be approved,but the fundamental logic of those institutions were set there. There's no more normativerevolutions there. So it's a very peaceful thing. Drug would say, yes, truth, reason,equality have all progressed. But as a result, our world is both the best for the very similar
	  
	  reasons that Hegel thinks it is. But also the worst that it's ever been. Maybe not theworst is the wrong phrase. It's the potential for violence has never been greater. And thisties back into Girard's psychology, which again is going to be very alien to peoplein modernity. But I think one that you'll appreciate where for him, metaphysical desire,this more memetic component of desire is much more easily trafficked between people who
	  
	  think of themselves as equals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz86cv55hnq940nk5ha02yn))
		- **Note**: Girard's philosophy of history is very interesting, especially when you compare it to the ideas of German thinkers Kant and Hegel. Girard agrees with how history has changed, but he has completely different opinions about how it should be. Philosophers like Gellien believe that truth, reason, and equality have grown and improved over time, and we are close to the end of history. This means that although we can still change institutions, the basic ideas behind them will stay the same. Girard also thinks that truth, reason, and equality have all grown, but he also believes that this has made the world both better and worse - it has never been more dangerous. Girard's ideas about metaphysical desire (the way people want things) are strange to people in modern times, but he believes that when people think of themselves as equals, it is easier for them to share their desires with each other.
	- As a sophomore, if a juniorgets a prestigious internship, I reason to myself, this guy's got a year ahead of me.And you see this in entrepreneurs as well. A 22 year old with a 10 million dollar company,and a 24 year old with a 200 million dollar company. The 22 year old thinks, give me sometime. The difference acts as a protective barrier to the identity. Whereas if you have
	  
	  a sophomore and you see this other sophomore get this prestigious internship, there's otherthings you can think, and this is the psychology of coping. You can think, well, he came froma richer family or this or that, or this or that, but desire is much more easily traffickedamongst equals. And that's why Girard thinks all forms of separation, which are ultimatelyevil, based on ultimate lies, are in the worldly sense, practically, if not good, then helpful.
	  
	  Caste systems, gender roles, professions and guild lineages, because these prevent peoplefrom competing with each other. The problem with what you described aboutthe internet giving access to all, Girard would say, is that now we're inviting everyoneto compete with everyone else. And my dad actually gave a really interesting observation.He's like, what could the Chinese farmer compare himself to in the forties? Or maybe not the
	  
	  forties, there was civil war going on, in the fifties, or especially in the Xing Dynasty.Not that much, right? He can't really see almost anyone else.But now, what is it, half of people have smartphones and a quarter of us have internet. Everyoneis comparing themselves to the most outrageous forms of display of luxury and wealth. Andso Girard thinks that fundamentally this equality has the potential for radical love because
	  
	  now we're fundamentally equals. And now we can truly affirm and love each other and renounceviolence. But it's also a place with a radical potential of violence, because we now so morereadily enter into competition with others. Before, half of us were sophomores, half werefreshmen. Now everyone's a sophomore. And we all think that we're equally deservingof these things. Access for all is the phrase that we all want to say. And this is why he'san apocalyptic thinker. History can go one of two ways. And in the end he eventually
	  
	  thinks it's going to go the negative way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz8enrd80ssqk5s0fb44gme))
		- **Note**: When a student in their second year of school sees another student in their third year get a special job, they might feel jealous. They might think that the other student is one year ahead of them. This happens with entrepreneurs too. For example, one 22 year old may have a business that makes 10 million dollars while another 24 year old may have a business that makes 200 million dollars. The 22 year old might think they need more time to reach the same level. This is a way of protecting themselves from feeling bad (a coping mechanism)
		  
		  But when two people in the same year of school get a special job, it can be harder to cope. The person who didn't get the job might think the other person has more money or better resources, but it's easier to think that when they are in the same situation. This is why philosopher Girard thinks that separating people into different categories (like social classes, gender roles, and professions) can be helpful. It can stop people from competing with each other too much. 
		  
		  However, the internet has changed things. Now everyone can easily compare themselves to others, and see luxury and wealth that they don't have. This can make people feel like they are competing for the same things, even though everyone is equal. Girard thinks that this could lead to either love or violence, and he believes that it will end badly.
	- he Buddhist solution where one recognizes that one's self is impermanentand transitory, but interdependent. Now I'm sure that I'm butchering this. I'd like tohear the fuller voice of this from you. Jonathan Bi:
	  
	  Yeah. Okay. I'll try to give this the speed run here if that's even possible. For Girard,the core psychological motor of humanity is metaphysical desire. And as we discussed already,metaphysical desire, what it really wants, is for the self to be a certain type of self.A self that's all-lasting, all-powerful, and the most real for social reality. And this
	  
	  is precisely the type of self that the Buddhist conception of emptiness is supposed to alleviateus from. The Buddhist, at least according to certain schools of thought, think thatwe mistakenly think a great deal of phenomenon are not impermanent, they're not constructed,and they're not dependent on certain causes to exist and go out of existence.For example, this earplug. I know that there are atoms flying in and out of it. But the
	  
	  human conceptual model treats this as one lasting entity, the earplug that moves throughspace and time. But the labeling of these series of atoms as the earplug is due to meand not due to some sort of objective arrangement in the world. Why choose these set of atomsand not the earplug and the wallet as a joint group. And the problem is when we apply that
	  
	  type of thinking to the self, the Buddhists think that we do exactly what Girard thinkswe do. We end up chasing models who appear to have a great deal of reality, trying tobe impermanent, trying to be the most real and trying to be all powerful.So it's the metaphysical, ontological confusion about phenomenon projected on the self thatis the root of our problems. And so the idea goes something like, there is actually a way
	  
	  that individuals can alleviate themselves from this memetic frenzy and contagion. Andthat's through the practices that make emptiness second nature to you. So mostly thinking intellectualstudy and then meditation, specifically the vipassanƒÅ. That's supposed to hammer, ifyou will, emptiness into you. I'm not very convinced by this argument. If I may, I wrote
	  
	  this manuscript when I was 20. So I think they're no more than the musings of a child,but the fundamental problem that I run into, even if everyone could practice this, is thatI think so much of the good parts of human civilization is predicated on this sort ofmetaphysical delusion, if in fact it is a delusion.And this goes back to everything that we talked about today, that the unrealistic and delusional
	  
	  yearning of going to the moon. And so I just think that once we get out of this, we'renot going to be vegetables per se. There's other motivating forces like compassion, butI think human civilization, will at the very least be unrecognizable or very hard to recognize.So long story short, I think even if an individual can fully liberate themselves from this faculty,I don't think a whole civilization, and certainly not the entire world can engage in this sort
	  
	  of practice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz8rbjq0rwgf3rh3pjfy9xz))

		- **Note**: Girard believes that people want to be special and powerful, but according to Buddhists, this is a mistake. This confusion about what is real and what is not is the root of our problems. Buddhists believe that practices like studying and meditating can help people understand that they are not really special or powerful, but this might not work for everyone or the entire world.
