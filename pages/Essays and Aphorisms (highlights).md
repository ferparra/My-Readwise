	- "Life is a difficult question; I have decided to spend my life in thinking about it." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq631rtsjma23h94e7sq48c))
	- ON NOISE.
	  
	  1.  a big diamond is cut up into pieces, it immediately loses its value as a whole; or if an army is scattered or divided into small bodies, it loses all its power; and in the same way a great intellect has no more power than an ordinary one as soon as it is interrupted, disturbed, distracted, or diverted; for its superiority entails that it concentrates all its strength on one point and object, just as a concave mirror concentrates all the rays of light thrown upon it. Noisy interruption prevents this concentration.
	  2.  This is the result of [Greek: hysteron proteron] (putting the cart before the horse), since we are directly opposing the natural development of our mind by obtaining ideas first and observations last; for teachers, instead of developing in a boy his faculties of discernment and judgment, and of thinking for himself, merely strive to stuff his head full of other people's thoughts. Subsequently, all the opinions that have sprung from misapplied ideas have to be rectified by a lengthy experience; and it is seldom that they are completely rectified. This is why so few men of learning have such sound common sense as is quite common among the illiterate.
	  3.  And, in general, children should not get to know life, in any aspect whatever, from the copy before they have learnt it from the original. Instead, therefore, of hastening to place mere books in their hands, one should make them gradually acquainted with things and the circumstances of human life, and above everything one should take care to guide them to a clear grasp of reality, and to teach them to obtain their ideas directly from the real world, and to form them in keeping with it--but not to get them from elsewhere, as from books, fables, or what others have said--and then later to make use of such ready-made ideas in real life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq63sdczrqqzhh8z9a2a2em))
		- **Note**: This passage is about noise and how it can interfere with a great intellect. It's like a big diamond - when it is cut up into pieces, it loses its value. The same can happen to a great intellect if it is interrupted, disturbed, distracted, or diverted. This is because a great intellect concentrates its strength on one thing - like a concave mirror concentrating light - and noise can prevent this from happening. We should not learn from books or from what other people say, but from experiencing things and understanding the real world. This will help us to have good common sense, which is not always common among those who are educated.
	- THE EMPTINESS OF EXISTENCE.
	  
	  1.  The scenes of our life are like pictures in rough mosaic, which have no effect at close quarters, but must be looked at from a distance in order to discern their beauty. So that to obtain something we have desired is to find out that it is worthless; we are always living in expectation of better things, while, at the same time, we often repent and long for things that belong to the past. We accept the present as something that is only temporary, and regard it only as a means to accomplish our aim. So that most people will find if they look back when their life is at an end, that they have lived their lifelong ad interim, and they will be surprised to find that something they allowed to pass by unnoticed and unenjoyed was just their life--that is to say, it was the very thing in the expectation of which they lived. And so it may be said of man in general that, befooled by hope, he dances into the arms of death.
	  2.  That boredom is immediately followed by fresh needs is a fact which is also true of the cleverer order of animals, because life has no true and genuine value in itself, but is kept in motion merely through the medium of needs and illusion. As soon as there are no needs and illusion we become conscious of the absolute barrenness and emptiness of existence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq6588dbph9zt754t93n7dm))
		- **Note**: People are always hoping for something better in the future, while at the same time they often regret things that happened in the past. When they look back on their life when it is over, they will be surprised to find that they have been living for something that did not really matter, and they will realize that they were tricked by hope. Even animals, who are cleverer than us, suffer from boredom when their needs are fulfilled and realize how empty life can be.
	- THINKING FOR ONESELF.
	  
	  1.  The largest library in disorder is not so useful as a smaller but orderly one; in the same way the greatest amount of knowledge, if it has not been worked out in one's own mind, is of less value than a much smaller amount that has been fully considered. For it is only when a man combines what he knows from all sides, and compares one truth with another, that he completely realises his own knowledge and gets it into his power. A man can only think over what he knows, therefore he should learn something; but a man only knows what he has pondered.
	  2.  This is why much reading robs the mind of all elasticity; it is like keeping a spring under a continuous, heavy weight. If a man does not want to think, the safest plan is to take up a book directly he has a spare moment.
	  3.  Men of learning are those who have read the contents of books. Thinkers, geniuses, and those who have enlightened the world and furthered the race of men, are those who have made direct use of the book of the world.
	  4.  it is a hundred times more valuable if he has acquired it by thinking it out for himself. For it is only by his thinking it out for himself that it enters as an integral part, as a living member into the whole system of his thought, and stands in complete and firm relation with it; that it is fundamentally understood with all its consequences, and carries the colour, the shade, the impress of his own way of thinking; and comes at the very moment, just as the necessity for it is felt, and stands fast and cannot be forgotten.
	  5.  Reading is thinking with some one else's head instead of one's own. But to think for oneself is to endeavour to develop a coherent whole, a system, even if it is not a strictly complete one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq66p4j354vjn71yctfc2y2))
		- **Note**: The author is saying that having a lot of knowledge is not as useful as having a little bit of knowledge that you have thought about. To get the most out of knowledge, you need to combine it with other knowledge and think about it. Reading a lot can be helpful but if you don't think about what you read, it won't be useful. People who have read a lot are called 'learners' and people who have thought about what they read and used it to help the world are called 'thinkers'. It is much more valuable if you think about what you have read and understand it on your own. Reading is like thinking with someone else's head, but thinking for yourself is when you try to put all the knowledge together in a system.
	- THE AGES OF LIFE.
	  
	  1.  Our whole life long it is the present, and the present alone, that we actually possess: the only difference is that at the beginning of life we look forward to a long future, and that towards the end we look back upon a long past; also that our temperament, but not our character, undergoes certain well-known changes, which make the present wear a different color at each period of life.
	  2.  to use Spinoza's phraseology, the child is learning to see the things and persons about it sub specie aeternitatis,--as particular manifestations of universal law.
	  3.  So it may be said that in childhood, life looks like the scenery in a theatre, as you view it from a distance; and that in old age it is like the same scenery when you come up quite close to it.
	  4.  The chief result gained by experience of life is clearness of view. This is what distinguishes the man of mature age, and makes the world wear such a different aspect from that which it presented in his youth or boyhood. It is only then that he sees things quite plain, and takes them for that which they really are: while in earlier years he saw a phantom-world, put together out of the whims and crotchets of his own mind, inherited prejudice and strange delusion: the real world was hidden from him, or the vision of it distorted. The first thing that experience finds to do is to free us from the phantoms of the brain--those false notions that have been put into us in youth.
	  5.  From the point of view we have been taking up until now, life may be compared to a piece of embroidery, of which, during the first half of his time, a man gets a sight of the right side, and during the second half, of the wrong. The wrong side is not so pretty as the right, but it is more instructive; it shows the way in which the threads have been worked together.
	  6.  But why is it that to an old man his past life appears so short? For this reason: his memory is short; and so he fancies that his life has been short too. He no longer remembers the insignificant parts of it, and much that was unpleasant is now forgotten; how little, then, there is left! For, in general, a man's memory is as imperfect as his intellect; and he must make a practice of reflecting upon the lessons he has learned and the events he has experienced, if he does not want them both to sink gradually into the gulf of oblivion.
	  7.  Deep truths may be perceived, but can never be excogitated--that is to say, the first knowledge of them is immediate, called forth by some momentary impression. This knowledge is of such a kind as to be attainable only when the impressions are strong, lively and deep; and if we are to be acquainted with deep truths, everything depends upon a proper use of our early years. In later life, we may be better able to work upon other people,--upon the world, because our natures are then finished and rounded off, and no more a prey to fresh views; but then the world is less able to work upon us. These are the years of action and achievement; while youth is the time for forming fundamental conceptions, and laying down the ground-work of thought. In youth it is the outward aspect of things that most engages us; while in age, thought or reflection is the predominating quality of the mind. Hence, youth is the time for poetry, and age is more inclined to philosophy. In practical affairs it is the same: a man shapes his resolutions in youth more by the impression that the outward world makes upon him; whereas, when he is old, it is thought that determines his actions.
	  8.  It is only then that a man can be said to be really rich in experience or in learning; he has then had time and opportunity enough to enable him to see and think over life from all its sides; he has been able to compare one thing with another, and to discover points of contact and connecting links, so that only then are the true relations of things rightly understood. Further, in old age there comes an increased depth in the knowledge that was acquired in youth; a man has now many more illustrations of any ideas he may have attained; things which he thought he knew when he was young, he now knows in reality. And besides, his range of knowledge is wider; and in whatever direction it extends, it is thorough, and therefore formed into a consistent and connected whole; whereas in youth knowledge is always defective and fragmentary.
	  9.  But though the tree of knowledge must reach its full height before it can bear fruit, the roots of it lie in youth.
	  10.  Every generation, no matter how paltry its character, thinks itself much wiser than the one immediately preceding it, let alone those that are more remote. It is just the same with the different periods in a man's life; and yet often, in the one case no less than in the other, it is a mistaken opinion.
	  11.  experience, knowledge, reflection, and skill in dealing with men, combine to give an old man an increasingly accurate insight into the ways of the world; his judgment becomes keen and he attains a coherent view of life: his mental vision embraces a wider range. Constantly finding new uses for his stores of knowledge and adding to them at every opportunity, he maintains uninterrupted that inward process of self-education, which gives employment and satisfaction to the mind, and thus forms the due reward of all its efforts.
	  12.  To talk to old people of this kind is like writing on the sand; if you produce any impression at all, it is gone almost immediately; old age is here nothing but the caput mortuum of life--all that is essential to manhood is gone.
	    1.  Note:Runoff analogy
	  13.  The main difference between youth and age will always be that youth looks forward to life, and old age to death; and that while the one has a short past and a long future before it, the case is just the opposite with the other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq699xra92kywasdypzh73a))
		- **Note**: The way we experience life changes as we age. When we are young, we look forward to a long future, and when we are older, we look back on a long past. Our feelings and emotions change as we age, but our character stays the same. As we get older, we learn to see things as they really are and not through our own biases and delusions. We gain wisdom and knowledge through our experiences, and our view of life becomes more clear and accurate. As we age, our knowledge becomes more thorough and complete, and we are able to make more sense of the world and understand how things are connected. We keep learning even as we get older, finding new uses for the knowledge we have gained and adding to it whenever we can. Talking to wise old people can give us insights into life, but their advice is quickly forgotten. In the end, the main difference between youth and age will always be that youth looks forward to life and old age looks back on death.
	- •   FREE-WILL AND FATALISM.
	    1.  The only freedom that exists is of a metaphysical character. In the physical world freedom is an impossibility. Accordingly, while our several actions are in no wise free, every man's individual character is to be regarded as a free act. He is such and such a man, because once for all it is his will to be that man. For the will itself, and in itself, and also in so far as it is manifest in an individual, and accordingly constitutes the original and fundamental desires of that individual, is independent of all knowledge, because it is antecedent to such knowledge.
	    2.  All genuine merit, moral as well as intellectual, is not merely physical or empirical in its origin, but metaphysical; that is to say, it is given a priori and not a posteriori; in other words, it lies innate and is not acquired, and therefore its source is not a mere phenomenon, but the thing-in-itself. Hence it is that every man achieves only that which is irrevocably established in his nature, or is born with him. Intellectual capacity needs, it is true, to be developed just as many natural products need to be cultivated in order that we may enjoy or use them; but just as in the case of a natural product no cultivation can take the place of original material, neither can it do so in the case of intellect. That is the reason why qualities which are merely acquired, or learned, or enforced--that is, qualities a posteriori, whether moral or intellectual--are not real or genuine, but superficial only, and possessed of no value. This is a conclusion of true metaphysics, and experience teaches the same lesson to all who can look below the surface. Nay, it is proved by the great importance which we all attach to such innate characteristics as physiognomy and external appearance, in the case of a man who is at all distinguished; and that is why we are so curious to see him. Superficial people, to be sure,--and, for very good reasons, commonplace people too,--will be of the opposite opinion; for if anything fails them they will thus be enabled to console themselves by thinking that it is still to come.
	    3.  That is why Seneca's remark, that even the smallest things may be taken as evidence of character, is so true: argumenta morum ex minimis quoque licet capere.[1] If a man shows by his absolutely unscrupulous and selfish behaviour in small things that a sentiment of justice is foreign to his disposition, he should not be trusted with a penny unless on due security.
	    4.  The man who has no conscience in small things will be a scoundrel in big things. If we neglect small traits of character, we have only ourselves to blame if we afterwards learn to our disadvantage what this character is in the great affairs of life.
	    5.  The whole influence of example--and it is very strong--rests on the fact that a man has, as a rule, too little judgment of his own, and often too little knowledge, o explore his own way for himself, and that he is glad, therefore, to tread in the footsteps of some one else. Accordingly, the more deficient he is in either of these qualities, the more is he open to the influence of example; and we find, in fact, that most men's guiding star is the example of others; that their whole course of life, in great things and in small, comes in the end to be mere imitation; and that not even in the pettiest matters do they act according to their own judgment. Imitation and custom are the spring of almost all human action. The cause of it is that men fight shy of all and any sort of reflection, and very properly mistrust their own discernment. At the same time this remarkably strong imitative instinct in man is a proof of his kinship with apes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq6bpdfqwaaz2sjw4hmq7sk))
		- **Tags**: #[[free will]]
		- **Note**: We all have free will, which means we are free to make our own choices in life. Our character is determined by these choices. Our character is something that comes from inside us, not from the knowledge or experience we have. Therefore, our character is something that we are born with and can't be changed. Other people's behavior can influence us, but it is ultimately up to us to decide how we will act. People often imitate each other, but we should use our own judgment when making decisions.
	- CHARACTER.
	  
	  1.  Men who aspire to a happy, a brilliant and a long life, instead of to a virtuous one, are like foolish actors who want to be always having the great parts,--the parts that are marked by splendour and triumph. They fail to see that the important thing is not what or how much, but how they act.
	  2.  What is the meaning of life at all? To what purpose is it played, this farce in which everything that is essential is irrevocably fixed and determined? It is played that a man may come to understand himself, that he may see what it is that he seeks and has sought to be; what he wants, and what, therefore, he is. This is a knowledge which must be imparted to him from without. Life is to man, in other words, to will, what chemical re-agents are to the body: it is only by life that a man reveals what he is, and it is only in so far as he reveals himself that he exists at all. Life is the manifestation of character, of the something that we understand by that word; and it is not in life, but outside of it, and outside time, that character undergoes alteration, as a result of the self-knowledge which life gives. Life is only the mirror into which a man gazes not in order that he may get a reflection of himself, but that he may come to understand himself by that reflection; that he may see what it is that the mirror shows.
	  3.  Since character, so far as we understand its nature, is above and beyond time, it cannot undergo any change under the influence of life. But although it must necessarily remain the same always, it requires time to unfold itself and show the very diverse aspects which it may possess. For character consists of two factors: one, the will-to-live itself, blind impulse, so-called impetuosity; the other, the restraint which the will acquires when it comes to understand the world; and the world, again, is itself will. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq6d52bvjncpp2pt102jvws))
		- **Note**: "Character is what makes us who we are and shows us what we want out of life. People who want to be happy, successful, and live a long life instead of a good one, are like actors who just want to play the best parts. But that's not the most important thing in life - it's not about what you have or how much you have, it's about how you act. 
		  
		  Life is a way for us to learn and understand ourselves. It's like a chemical reaction - it helps us to show who we truly are and only then can we exist. Life is like a mirror - we look into it to see what kind of person we are. 
		  
		  Character doesn't change over time, but it takes time to show different parts of it. It's made up of two parts - a desire to live and be impulsive, and the control we gain when we understand the world, which is also made up of desires. "
	- ON THE WISDOM OF LIFE: APHORISMS.
	  
	  1.  What makes us almost inevitably ridiculous is our serious way of treating the passing moment, as though it necessarily had all the importance which it seems to have. It is only a few great minds that are above this weakness, and, instead of being laughed at, have come to laugh themselves. *
	  2.  As you are all so self-centred, recognise your own weakness. You know that you cannot like a man who does not show himself friendly to you; you know that he cannot do so for any length of time unless he likes you, and that he cannot like you unless you show that you are friendly to him; then do it: your false friendliness will gradually become a true one. Your own weakness and subjectivity must have some illusion.
	  3.  It is the converse that is true. Men of great intellectual worth, or, still more, men of genius, can have only very few friends; for their clear eye soon discovers all defects, and their sense of rectitude is always being outraged afresh by the extent and the horror of them. It is only extreme necessity that can compel such men not to betray their feelings, or even to stroke the defects as if they were beautiful additions.
	  4.  We must always try to preserve large views. If we are arrested by details we shall get confused, and see things awry. The success or the failure of the moment, and the impression that they make, should count for nothing.[1]
	  5.  How difficult it is to learn to understand oneself, and clearly to recognise what it is that one wants before anything else; what it is, therefore, that is most immediately necessary to our happiness; then what comes next; and what takes the third and the fourth place, and so on. Yet, without this knowledge, our life is planless, like a captain without a compass.
	  6.  Therefore, as regards our own welfare, there are only two ways in which we can use wealth. We can either spend it in ostentatious pomp, and feed on the cheap respect which our imaginary glory will bring us from the infatuated crowd; or, by avoiding all expenditure that will do us no good, we can let our wealth grow, so that we may have a bulwark against misfortune and want that shall be stronger and better every day; in view of the fact that life, though it has few delights, is rich in evils. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq6eyccrapz2pbv179mkaex))
		- **Note**: We can often act in silly ways when we take the small moments in life too seriously. To avoid this, it's important to recognize our own weaknesses and be friendly to others. People who are very smart or have a lot of talent usually have fewer friends, because they can see the faults in others. It's hard to stay strong and keep a good perspective when life throws us challenges. It can be tempting to waste money on things that won't make us happy, but it's smarter to save money so we have something to fall back on if things get tough. Finally, it is hard to really understand ourselves and know what we need most to be happy.
	- ON REPUTATION.
	  
	  1.  There are two ways of behaving in regard to merit: either to have some of one's own, or to refuse any to others. The latter method is more convenient, and so it is generally adopted. As envy is a mere sign of deficiency, so to envy merit argues the lack of it.
	  2.  Modesty should be the virtue of those who possess no other.
	  3.  Xenophon's remark: he must be a wise man who knows what is wise.
	  4.  it is a suspicious sign if a reputation comes quickly; for an application of the laws of homogeneity will show that such a reputation is nothing but the direct applause of the multitude.
	  5.  What this means may be seen by a remark once made by Phocion, when he was interrupted in a speech by the loud cheers of the mob. Turning to his friends who were standing close by, he asked: Have I made a mistake and said something stupid?[1]
	  6.  For when any new and wide-reaching truth comes into the world--and if it is new, it must be paradoxical--an obstinate stand will be made against it as long as possible; nay, people will continue to deny it even after they slacken their opposition and are almost convinced of its truth. Meanwhile it goes on quietly working its way, and, like an acid, undermining everything around it. From time to time a crash is heard; the old error comes tottering to the ground, and suddenly the new fabric of thought stands revealed, as though it were a monument just uncovered. Everyone recognizes and admires it.
	  7.  Let him never forget the words of Balthazar Gracian: lo bueno si breve, dos vezes bueno--good work is doubly good if it is short. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq6gmt5p5che7atqqkwcq6s))
		- **Note**: 1. People can act in two ways when it comes to merit: either they have some of their own or they refuse to acknowledge the merit of others. People often choose the latter because it's easier. Envying the merit of others shows that you don't have any of your own.
		  
		  2. People who don't have any merit should practice modesty.
		  
		  3. Xenophon said that a wise person is one who knows what is wise.
		  
		  4. If someone gets a reputation quickly, it could be a bad sign. This might mean that people are only praising them because they want to, not because they deserve it.
		  
		  5. To understand this, you can look at what Phocion said when people started cheering loudly during one of his speeches. He asked if he had said something wrong.
		  
		  6. Sometimes a new truth comes into the world and people deny it even though it is actually true. It takes time for people to accept it, and when they do, everyone admires it.
		  
		  7. Balthazar Gracian once said that good work is even better if it is short.
