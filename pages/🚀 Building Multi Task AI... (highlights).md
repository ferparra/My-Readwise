	- 🚀 Building Multi task AI agent with @LangChainAI and using @aimstackio to trace and visualize the executions
	  
	  Let’s play..
	  We’ll prompt the agent to discover who Leonardo DiCaprio’s girlfriend is and calculate her current age raised to the power of 0.43🧵

	- @LangChainAI We’re going to build an agent equipped with two tools:
	  
	  🔍 the SerpApi tool to access Google search results,
	  🧮 the LLM -math tool to perform required mathematical operations.

	- @LangChainAI ⛓Now that the chain is set up, let’s integrate the Aim callback.
	  
	  It takes just a few lines of code and Aim will capture all the moving pieces during the execution.

	- @LangChainAI Awesome! 🎇
	  
	  Time to run multiple executions and launch the Aim UI to visualize and explore the results:
	  
	  When navigating to an individual execution page, you’ll find an overview of system information and execution details.
	  
	  Here you can access:

	- @LangChainAI 👀Aim automatically captures terminal outputs during execution.
	  
	  Access these logs in the “Logs” tab to easily keep track of the progress of your AI system and identify issues.
	  
	  Easily debug and examine an individual execution.

	- @LangChainAI 🔦In the “Text” tab, you can explore the inner workings of a chain, including agent actions, tools and LLMs inputs and outputs.
	  
	  This in-depth view allows you to review the metadata collected at every step of execution.

	- @LangChainAI 🔥With Aim’s Text Explorer, you can effortlessly compare multiple executions, examining their actions, inputs, and outputs side by side.
	  
	  It helps to identify patterns or spot discrepancies.
	  
	  Amazing, right? ✨
	  Give a try, show us your work!
