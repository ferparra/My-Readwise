	- Thread on some lessons learned from recording ~500 podcast episodes üëá ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1255574856776597504))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Both you and the guest should prepare.
	  
	  Send them q's and ideally have them write responses if they're up for it‚Äîedit Q's accordingly
	  
	  Learn enough to ask nuanced follow up Q's. Ask other experts for Q's as needed.
	  
	  A podcast is a performance. Prepped is better than improvised. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1255574857552560128))
	- I joke that reactions post-podcasts are similar to reactions post-sex in some ways.
	  
	  Afterwards everyone's like: 
	  
	  "How'd I do?" 
	  
	  "Was that good for you?" 
	  
	  "Did I talk too much?" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1255574858416570369))
	- Ease the guest by telling them they get final edit, that your goal is to make them look great, and that, despite the prep, your conversation should be casual as if you were chatting over a drink.
	  
	  If they are eager to promote their stuff, get it out of the way in the beginning. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1255574859259633665))
	- Instead of yes/no questions, ask open-ended & double questions (‚Äúwhat do you believe about X and how has that evolved overtime/what does that mean for‚Ä¶‚Äù)
	  
	  As a podcast guest, view Q's less as specific Q's to be answered and more as prompts to say whatever's most interesting. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1255574860123664384))
	- Other tips:
	- Set expectations with your listeners by being consistent:
	- Qs I like:
	  
	  When you look back on the arc of your career, what's the thread that ties everything together? What threads have you kept pulling?
	  
	  When you look forward on what you aim to achieve in the decades to come, what do you want your eventual wikipedia page to say? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1255574863068061696))
	- Other broad Q's to ask:
	  
	  What are the major camps in your field? 
	  Major debates? Where do you stand on them? 
	  What would need to be true for you to believe the other side? 
	  What have you changed your mind on?
	  How has your field evolved over time? What were the different waves? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1255574863906869248))
	- Bring up controversial points (or questions they can't answer directly) by using the passive voice.
	  
	  "Some people say X"
	  
	  "How would you respond to the critique that..."
	  
	  "Hypothetically, if someone were to say someone like you should do this, what would you recommend to them?" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1255574864758366208))
	- When podcasting, one of my favorite feelings is asking a Q + then figuring out on the fly what the next Q will be, jostling a few different variations while also listening & being open to going in a totally different direction
	  
	  Podcasts as real-time conversational chess ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1255574865559445504))
	- Why should you start a podcast?
	- For podcast guests: Think of the Q's as prompts to say the most insightful thing you can say.
	  
	  Don't focus on pleasantries, politeness, or even answering the exact Q if you don't have a good answer.
	  
	  A podcast is a dance. The host will suggest, but you take it where you wanna go. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1260335561899782145))
