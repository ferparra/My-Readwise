	- AI in Gmail, Maps, and Photos
	- PaLM 2 is launched!
	  
	  A more powerful AI than PaLM. There are 4 models that differ in size: Gecko, Otter, Bison, and Unicorn.
	  
	  Gecko is so lightweight that it can work on mobile devices. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dr_cintas/status/1656367214692556800))
	- PaLM 2 can be fine-tuned on domain-specific knowledge like:
	- BARD (this one is huge).
	- AI on Google Workspace.
	- Duet AI for Workspace. 
	  
	  Letâ€™s say you are working on a document or an email, PaLM 2 can read and offer suggestions or even create images for you. 
	  
	  It can create even speaker notes for your slides! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dr_cintas/status/1656367222908940293))
