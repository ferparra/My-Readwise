- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Dec 24th, 2022]]
	- Uniswap Alpha leak ðŸ§µ - The most in depth divergent loss analysis *on real data* ever done.
		- **Note**: Thread
	- A small sample of my favorite results (click link to dive deep, be patient it's a big website w/ interactive visuals): 
	  
	  55% of closed ETH-USDC 0.05% positions beat HODL.
	  
	  40% lost against HODL.
	  
	  I actually like those odds.

	- Vaults are effectively negligible against HODL. This is really unfortunate, as I had hoped professionally managed Uni v3 LPs would outperform.
	  
	  They generally lose less and win less. So it is at least risk-capped.

	- Historically, ETH-USDC positions has a Goldilocks problem.
	  
	  Too tight and you'll lose a lot. Too wide and you just don't profit enough over HODL.
	  
	  But even middle-width is chaotic. ETH-USDC is a HARD game to play. ETH-WBTC is much easier.

	- 18% of closed ETH-USDC positions were just-in-time (JIT) liquidity. BUT - the argument that they are extractive is totally exaggerated.
	  
	  It's better to think of JIT as a MEV order-book trick (i.e., on-chain Cowswap) than it is to think of it as ruining LPing.

	- Uniswap v3 ETH-USDC is definitely winnable. 
	  
	  While Elite positions (1%+ gain against HODL; <100,000 block lifespan, <2,000 tick spaces wide) are only ~8% of positions.
	  
	  372 individuals have 2+ Elite positions generated.  These people are 3x+ as skilled as the average LPer. ðŸ‘€

	- Moving on to ETH-WBTC
	  
	  48% of closed positions beat HODL. 
	  40% lost to HODL.
	  
	  Very crazy to see this lower than ETH-USDC.

	- ETH-WBTC JIT is pretty rare, only 4% of positions were JIT.
	  
	  What I loved to see is that ETH-WBTC is TOTALLY WINNABLE. You just gotta be patient.
	  
	  Keeping a ETH-WBTC position open 6+ months very consistently (>80%) beat HODL when including fees.

	- Regardless of Bull or Bear conditions; People found a way to profit on ETH-WBTC 0.3% no matter the market.
	  
	  Elite positions are > 1% gain against HODL in < 100,000 blocks (2 weeks).
	  
	  They've been created and closed throughout the last 2 years.

	- ETH-WBTC also has a goldilocks situation for position width.
	  
	  Too narrow and you're competing with the (rare) JIT bots who snipe your gains.
	  
	  Too wide and you'll have to be extra patient to win.
	  
	  But there's a nice profitable middle to play in.

	- Of course, because so many of the wide LPers WERE patient, we see some tick spaces legit never lost against HODL!

	- 175 LPers were associated with 247 elite ETH-WBTC positions (remember, positions are transferrable. Are these elite LPers friends??) 
	  
	  38 LPers had at least 2+ elite positions created. With a median 23% elite rate; this group is 7x as skilled as the average. 
	  
	  That is bonkers!ðŸ‘€

	- If you liked this pls retweet so I can argue that it's worth doing more of this deep research nobody else wants to do.

	- Everything from data collection queries to accounting methodologies (including custom fixes) all open source: 
	  
	  (will clean this repo & update README I know it's messy)
