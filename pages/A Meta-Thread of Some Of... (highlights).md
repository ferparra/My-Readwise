	- A meta-thread of some of my favourite Twitter threads!
	- On negative probabilities, especially in quantum mechanics: https://t.co/rkjb3YF29o
	- On the limits to longevity across species: https://t.co/Hz4HvRf0O1
	- How to remember anything: https://t.co/AZthEEWmJc
	- On the impact of making books web-native and open access: https://t.co/8kF5PcfY9G
	- This thread, per @DanielGross's suggestion: https://t.co/LwPQrjSm1s
	- On the varieties of material existence: https://t.co/Usxx12BnCB
	- On magic paper, an exploration of mathematics in the dynamic medium: https://t.co/mXjQnKUSBW
	- How do people organize their reading? Many terrific replies: https://t.co/6KfhO5aVU3
	- "What's something that strikes you as very unusual that very smart people are working on?" With many interesting replies: https://t.co/ZkrmqlyhV4
	- A sorta similar thread which I loved, from @patrickc: "Where do you most often come across interesting ideasâ€”especially weird or surprising ones?" https://t.co/5YaB7oLfJn
	- "What are some books, videos, articles, papers, and essays you've revisited over and over, perhaps for many years?" (With many of mine - things I've often revisited > 10 times) https://t.co/cmIHuHsGVP
	- On field finding versus field founding in research: https://t.co/cNlVtYKBZK
	- A tonne of thoughtful replies to my question: what are the most beautiful video games you have played? https://t.co/ykTIv1dJzw
	- Thread introducing an essay from @patrickc and myself, arguing that science has suffered from greatly diminishing returns: https://t.co/2NXrk8wPD9
	- On massively multiplayer car racing, emergence, and the notion that there can be two completely different & correct explanations for the same phenomenon https://t.co/MctQv4eXzq
	- I really enjoyed this set of observations on tech, from @patio11 https://t.co/DGm8r5dbGJ
	- A thoughtful, stimulating thread on how reading fiction can change you: https://t.co/fHQQAwYani
	  I suspect much of this can be true of other media, including painting, music, and video games. Also related: Ebert's observation that movies can be machines for generating empathy.
	- On cultivating a thriving ecosystem of scientific publishing startups, and the role of for-profits and not-for-profits in an open scientific future: https://t.co/iYHGNr2Tki
	- . @andy_matuschak gives a brief overview of the new mnemonic medium that we developed: https://t.co/wKfx2ejsvm
	- A short proof that the circuit for quantum teleportation works: https://t.co/raBwMqHX03
	- Where does that teleportation circuit come from anyway? A short piece of Twitter discovery fiction, explaining a plausible story by which you might have come to discover the circuit for quantum teleportation in the first place: https://t.co/KVC7FeDrq1
	- Some preliminary analysis of how the mnemonic medium project (with @andy_matuschak) is working: https://t.co/dSJzHYtQj4
	- I ask whether people without a mind's eye (aphantastics) are able to use memory palace techniques. Many of the replies were really remarkable!  https://t.co/qs7JHwQvPn
	- On the challenge of finding governance principles (including technical & architectural ideas) for the software layer mediating the systems that run our world: https://t.co/qdAvCVc120
	- "That study failed to replicate" is often treated as a condemnation. Reality is much more complicated, and failure to replicate means little, without much more information: https://t.co/azZWzG394I
	- On "The Science of Science": https://t.co/potbylhgxt
	- . @wtgowers's thread-of-threads exploring some fun observations about small sets of real numbers: https://t.co/wWY6QkXYu0

	- My working notes on direct air carbon capture (DAC), and the implications for climate change
	  
	  https://t.co/p2gF6zIB45
	- A thread in which I ask people how they personally have decided to act to address climate change. Many fascinating responses: https://t.co/u8o2Xn0qYw
	- Which artist or musician most reliably evokes the numinous for you? With 300+ thoughtful replies! https://t.co/XztbAMPQjr
