	- The Higgs Boson - A Big Problem in Particle Physics
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* The Higgs particle is a puzzle that has vexed scientists for years., * In order for the theory of particle physics to work, physicists needed to tweak it a little bit., * This led to the discovery of new particles that don't decay, called the Higgs boson.)

	  And just some very brief background on this. So Higgs particles make up the Higgs field, which is this big cloud of bosons or particles. So matter started out zipping around like photons, just unencumbered by mass. But interaction with the Higgs field is what makes matter interact with gravity and have that mass be gravitationally attracted to each other. But Higgs bosons, very hard to find. You have to get like a large chadron collider, say, maybe 27 kilometers under Geneva. And then you got to race protons at each other. You got to explode them. And then you got to measure what's left, aka a decay signature. And if you're looking through all those pieces and you have pieces and parts for what could have been Higgs boson that existed for a fraction of a millisecond, then that's almost, almost proof. But for a long time, this possibility of the Higgs particle had vexed science for years. One leading scientist wanted to call it a goddamn particle. But his book publisher was like, let's go softer. And naively made the face palm modification to just call it the god particle, which has been making physicists cringe for decades now. But yes, essentially things just didn't add up.

	  And so this was a huge puzzle. It's analogous to having an ice cube sitting in an oven and you turn the oven on and the ice cube still there. Wow. So we called this the hierarchy problem. And for people like me, we write it with a capital H when we were at our academic papers. It was a big deal. It seemed to be the reason why our theory of particle physics just could not be complete.

	  So prior to 2013, they knew something was quite right.

	  And so we had these great exotic theories. They had funny names, supersymmetry, extra dimensions, compositeness, maybe the electron and its cousins are not fundamental, but are actually made of smaller things. Oh, wow. So this was the heyday in the 90s of doing particle physics. And right around that time, as we were developing these really awesome theories, people realized, hey, in order for this theory to work, meaning in order for protons, not to decay too quickly, in order for the universe to actually look like the way it does, we need to tweak it a little bit. And one output is we get these new particles that stick around. They don't decay. They're just around. That's kind of weird. And I imagine there's some particle physicist sitting in his office saying this, and astronomer walks by and says, you have particles just sitting around contributing mass? Have you heard about this anomaly that we have? There's more mass in these galaxies. And so particle physicists were kind of smug. Just said, oh, yeah, OK, good. I have discovered what your dark matter ought to be. So in 15 years, when we turn on this collider, we're going to discover what this particle is. We'll measure how heavy it is. And I will tell you exactly what's in these galaxies that you've been looking at for the past 100 years. This was the promise. And so particle physicists didn't even care about the dark matter because that was the output of this elegant theory that solved the capital H hierarchy problem.
