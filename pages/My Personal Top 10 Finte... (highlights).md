	- My personal top 10 fintech predictions for the next decade. Going out on a limb on some!
	  
	  1) We‘ll see dozens of new unicorns across emerging markets (LatAm, Asia, Africa, etc.) - with banking, lending and payments leading the way, but insurance and wealth mgmt thereafter ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattLevinson/status/1210359619182354432))

	- 2)  We’ll see an acceleration of non-financial companies layering in payments, lending, and insurance as ancillary revenue drivers - and valuable startups built to provide the infrastructure for them ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattLevinson/status/1210359624093835264))
	- 3) At least two of the FAANGs will develop a meaningful financial services offerings that comprises 10%+ of their revenue ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattLevinson/status/1210359625142480896))
	- 4)  Bitcoin will extend its position as the dominant crypto. It will gain perception as an uncorrelated and potentially high yielding asset with institutions - who will justify it as a small piece of any well diversified portfolio.

	- 5) Pure-play lenders previously valued as tech companies will continue to struggle in public markets. An APR is not a sustainably differentiated experience to consumers or businesses - who will continue to have more options shop for loans easily online ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattLevinson/status/1210359627201822721))
	- 6) The notion of “point of sale” financial services will be extended meaningfully to B2B - so its easier for companies to pay each other digitally, extend terms to manage cashflow, transact internationally, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattLevinson/status/1210359628212719616))
	- 7) At least one of the “challenger banks” will win in its market and become a $25b+ public digital financial institution. Keep in mind that JP Morgan Chase is a $400b company ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattLevinson/status/1210359629257084928))
	- 8) Stripe ($35b) will become the most valuable fintech company in the U.S., surpassing @paypal ($130b today). But they won’t go public in the next couple years ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattLevinson/status/1210359630272045056))
	- 9) Valuable tech-enabled active asset managers will emerge - finding new ways to make illiquid or opaque (but uncorrelated) asset classes more scalable, enabling them to gather AUM. Asset gathering incumbents like Blackrock and Fidelity may acquire some ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattLevinson/status/1210359631870091264))
	- 10) Fintech exits will continue to accelerate. There are now nearly 60 fintech unicorns globally and investors will have to demand liquidity at some point ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattLevinson/status/1210359633015115777))
