	- Roam42's SmartBlocks in @RoamResearch offer a lot more power than queries, templates and text expanders can achieve alone
	  
	  Here are just a few things that you can do:
	  
	  1. Reset your workspace to neutral or configure it for specific tasks

	- 2. @fbgallet Interstitial Journaling buttons power-up. It calculates the time you spent on self-defined activities and categories with no friction plus it highlights whether you spent enough time on them or not.
	  
	  You can see at a glance if you are having a good day or not. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elaptics/status/1479588359685111808))
	- 3. Ultraworking cycles. Myself, @cortexfutura and @LavercombeMark have created and shared templates which are a form of AoT (algorithm of thought)

	- More generally you can prompt for input to program your attention and do things like switch on dates for advanced templating, e.g. only include a meetings section on weekdays or show a different random quote from other pages on the weekend ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elaptics/status/1479588362168143872))
	- @dvargas92495 v2 of SmartBlocks is faster, and has a built-in store so it's easy to find more examples like PDF & docx exports and integrations with external services like weather or Twitter ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elaptics/status/1479588363296382976))
