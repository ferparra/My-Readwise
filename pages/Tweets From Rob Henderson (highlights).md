	- “loneliness in late adulthood is deadlier than smoking. Indeed, once you’re over 65, you’re better off smoking, drinking, and overeating with your friends than you are sitting at home alone.” https://t.co/0NxrATpJzg

	- “When structures deteriorate, they become dominated by people who play power games. It happens all the time…the game is the laying unavoidable tripwires. If I put enough tripwires around you, then you will inevitably stumble across one of them.” https://t.co/JhBmlIq4Uj ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/robkhenderson/status/1410207710461763586))
	- Dark triad Machiavellians are "rarely concerned with their internal life; they do not analyse their thoughts and feelings, nor do they often rely on their imagination..concrete and logical ways of thinking in which emotional reactions play hardly any role" https://t.co/4z0GEpYHW8

	- "This is perhaps the key point about the stories we live by: They are not objective replays of the past..episodic memory is highly selective..Unconsciously and unwittingly, we reconstruct the past in light of what we see today and imagine the future to be" https://t.co/oivxQSDQsK

	- Men who can do 40 push-ups or more have a 96 percent reduced risk of heart disease compared with men who could do less than 10 push-ups. Push-ups are a better predictor of whether a man will get heart disease than an aerobic treadmill test. https://t.co/k5R3CJ5oa6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/robkhenderson/status/1531339838087057409))
	- "people's thinking is remarkably simple and lazy.....any action sets off a limitless chain of reactions. It is never so simple as A leads to B...Other actors will be pulled into the drama and it is hard to predict their motivations and responses." https://t.co/P7gPy5pplU

	- "Those who rarely ate socially had many fewer friends and family they could count on for moral, social, emotional, or financial support— as few as half the number of intimate friends as those who regularly ate socially...eating social dinners increases life satisfaction"

	- Young guys: Spend six months in the gym, eat a healthy diet, buy clothes that fit, get a good haircut, work hard, increase your earning potential, and improve your social skills. Then see if you can find a compatible romantic partner. If you can't, then it's your fault. https://t.co/dw6hhWM5CM ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/robkhenderson/status/1575465687228862465))
	- "great players know when to walk away...they are more likely to recognize when game conditions aren't favorable or when they're not playing well...given that they recognize those things, they are more likely to quit the game because of it." https://t.co/hEI8rUK4Kk

	- “time traps can make us time poor. One of them is busyness as a status symbol…we see our colleagues having a lot of things in their calendar.

	- "Hiring is a much more uncertain decision than most people want to believe. You have a candidate's CV, their references, and a few interviews...the equivalent of entering a long-term relationship based on a couple of dates and having two mutual friends." https://t.co/02cTyBp9IZ

	- "Every time you rationalize away new information to cling to a belief, that belief becomes more woven into the fabric of your identity...the next time you discover conflicting information...you're going to be even more motivated to stick to those beliefs" https://t.co/V1LzTRmqCV

	  – Hemingway (The Art of the Short Story) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/robkhenderson/status/1593281675445903362))
	- "optimists work harder and longer hours, which may account for their higher pay...optimism has been linked to achievement in education, business, sport and electoral politics...overestimating one's probability of success is advantageous in a world of uncertainty and competition."

	- “If someone asks for reassurance and accepts it, that is an honest interaction. But if someone asks for reassurance, and—after it is given—finds a way to undermine the giver, that is a game.” https://t.co/XX4bg2SnQR ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/robkhenderson/status/1593997828413485057))
