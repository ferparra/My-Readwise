	- **Spiral Dynamics** (**SD**) is a model of the evolutionary development of individuals, organizations, and societies. It was initially developed by [Don Edward Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Edward_Beck) and Christopher Cowan based on the [emergent cyclical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_cyclical_theory) of [Clare W. Graves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_W._Graves), combined with [memetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics) as proposed by [Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins) and further developed by [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi).
