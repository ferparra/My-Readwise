	- **Spiral Dynamics** (**SD**) is a model of the evolutionary development of individuals, organizations, and societies. It was initially developed by [Don Edward Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Edward_Beck) and Christopher Cowan based on the [emergent cyclical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_cyclical_theory) of [Clare W. Graves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_W._Graves), combined with [memetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics) as proposed by [Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins) and further developed by [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi).

	- Spiral Dynamics describes how value systems and worldviews emerge from the interaction of "life conditions" and the mind's capacities.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Dynamics#cite_note-9) The emphasis on life conditions as essential to the progression through value systems is unusual among similar theories, and leads to the view that no level is inherently positive or negative, but rather is a response to the local environment.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Dynamics#cite_note-10) Through these value systems, groups and cultures structure their societies and individuals integrate within them. Each distinct set of values is developed as a response to solving the problems of the previous system. Changes between states may occur incrementally (first order change) or in a sudden breakthrough (second order change).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Dynamics#cite_note-11) The value systems develop in a specific order, and the most important question when considering the value system being expressed in a particular behavior is *why* the behavior occurs.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Dynamics#cite_note-12) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv05cnhxxy05xv966j0sh8pd))
		- **Note**: Spiral Dynamics is a way of understanding how different values and beliefs can develop from the things we experience in life and from what our minds can do. This way of thinking is unique compared to other theories because it believes that each level of values is not completely good or bad, but is based on the environment someone is in. These values and beliefs help groups and people to live together. They also help people to solve problems and make changes. The order of these values also matters, and it is important to think about why someone behaves the way they do.
