	- Organizing my business, personal life, and creative work in @NotionHQ  is one of the most powerful things I've ever done.
	  
	  Here’s how I do it: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1499388402378149895))

	- @NotionHQ 1.  My Business in Notion
	  
	  Going from a solo creator to a 10 person team has been a wild ride. 
	  
	  I've never done this before, so I quickly became overwhelmed with the influx of responsibilities:
	  
	  • managing a team
	  •  recruiting talented people
	  •  delegating tasks I used to do ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1499388405167370242))
	- @NotionHQ One thing that saved me was developing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) as lists in Notion.
	  
	  SOPs likely saved my business life as we scaled

	- @NotionHQ It started as a weekly ritual with my then-assistant, @bethenyswineha2 (now our Chief of Staff)
	  
	  Betheny and I created a few SOPs every week, and ended up with a roadmap of 100+ checklists & guides any employee could use to take ownership over work I used to need to do myself ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1499388424188477446))
	- @NotionHQ @bethenyswineha2 Here's a quick example SOP: our process for generating Kindle ebooks from paid blog posts on an annual basis. Formely tedious, now straightforward!

	- @NotionHQ @bethenyswineha2 The takeaway:
	  
	  Tracking SOPs as a team allows everyone to spend time on tasks that use their BEST thinking
	  
	  Instead of spending time trying to remember how to complete basic tasks ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1499388447177457666))
	- @NotionHQ @bethenyswineha2 2. Our Life in Notion
	  
	  2 years ago, @TheLaurenValdez and I bought our first house in @LongBeachCity
	  
	  Owning a house is at least as complicated as running a business: 
	  
	  •  Managing & paying bills
	  •  Tracking maintenance schedules
	  •  Completing ceaseless household tasks ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1499388450663026689))
	- @NotionHQ @bethenyswineha2 @TheLaurenValdez @LongBeachCity Lauren and I created a house operating manual on Notion to simplify our household tasks and management.
	  
	  We made this digital, so the information is searchable and actionable.
	  
	  Here's our "home page":

	- @NotionHQ @bethenyswineha2 @TheLaurenValdez @LongBeachCity We created databases on storage, house maintenance, hot tub cleaning, and much, much more.
	  
	  It's easy for us to see when a task was last completed, who's responsible for each task going forward, and track of documents and vendors from previous projects

	- @NotionHQ @bethenyswineha2 @TheLaurenValdez @LongBeachCity This "home operation manual" saves us countless hours, and gives us peace of mind and clarity on what we need to do in order in order to maintain our home life.
	  
	  Also, knowing exactly what's in each closet without having to check is just so satisfying. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1499388480648011776))
	- @NotionHQ @bethenyswineha2 @TheLaurenValdez @LongBeachCity 3. My Creative Work in Notion
	  
	  I use Notion to support my writing efforts. 
	  
	  Writing is my passion, but it's also the main marketing channel for our entire business.
	  
	  Here's my system for generating writing, while balancing my energy, spontaneity, and need for consistent output. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1499388484133478400))
	- @NotionHQ @bethenyswineha2 @TheLaurenValdez @LongBeachCity I love Notion's Kanban board feature. 
	  
	  Kanban was originally invented by Toyota to track the movement of parts across the factory floor – all the way to the finished vehicle.
	  
	  Silcon Valley picked it up for software. Now I use it for tracking my writing.

	- @NotionHQ @bethenyswineha2 @TheLaurenValdez @LongBeachCity Here’s how it works: each column represents a stage of the creation of a piece of work. 
	  
	  As I make progress on a post, I simply move the card to the next stage until completion.

	- @NotionHQ @bethenyswineha2 @TheLaurenValdez @LongBeachCity At any given time, I have 30+ pieces of writing at various stages of creative fermentation.
	  
	  As I make progress on a post, I simply move the card to the next stage until completion. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1499388513850167298))
	- @NotionHQ @bethenyswineha2 @TheLaurenValdez @LongBeachCity If I didn't use a system like this, deciding what to write next - or determining what's ready to publish - would be stressful and overwhelming.
	  
	  Tracking each piece of writing as it creatively percolates frees me to choose what I FEEL like working on based on THIS exact moment. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1499388517302087680))
	- @NotionHQ @bethenyswineha2 @TheLaurenValdez @LongBeachCity Sometimes, a piece of writing will languish for weeks or months.
	  
	  Certain pieces only works when I'm inspired. Other times, I feel like writing something finicky and detail-oriented. That's ok!
	  
	  With this system, I can trust the writing will happen exactly when it should. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1499388520431038468))
	- @NotionHQ @bethenyswineha2 @TheLaurenValdez @LongBeachCity @NotionHQ is just one part of my Second Brain - the bigger system I rely on to not forget my most important ideas, tasks, and life projects.
	  
	  I hope these 3 examples can inspire you to create your own system. It will change your life for the better! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1499388522930786305))
