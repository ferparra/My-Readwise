document_note:: This study found that false memories can be formed within seconds and are shaped by our expectations. The research focused on people's memories of letters, which were often incorrect when a mirrored letter was shown. The inaccuracy rate was higher when more time passed before the recall. The results suggest that our memory is affected by our preconceptions almost immediately and the authors hope to explore this further with social knowledge such as prejudices and beliefs.
