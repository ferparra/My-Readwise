	- Transformers led to the AI revolution that we see today! ðŸ”¥
	  
	  I recently watched @karpathy 's incredible GPT from scratch video & created a visual guide for my reference.
	  
	  I'm sharing it in this thread ðŸ§µ ðŸ‘‡

		- **Note**: Thread
	- Here's the GPTLanguageModel class & its visual representation.
	  
	  I'll break it down for you in the subsequent tweets.

	- We start with the Block!
	  
	  Depending on how deep you want to build your network, numbers of blocks (N) can be changed
	  
	  Each block has:
	- The multi-headed attention ðŸ”¥
	  
	  Self attention is applied in parallel across multiple heads & results are concatenated at the end.

	- The feed forward module!
	  
	  A simple linear layer followed by a non-linearity.

	- At the bottom we have two things:
	  
	  A a token embedding table, that provides embeddings for each token.
	  
	  And a positional embedding table that helps the network understand relative positions of the tokens in each block.
