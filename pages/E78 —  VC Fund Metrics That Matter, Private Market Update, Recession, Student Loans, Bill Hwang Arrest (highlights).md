	  Summary:
	  Not everybody's in that position. Individuals with no an endowment is not, because they have to create distributions every year. They o about the mega endowments where they met a forea, you know, forder or harvard may not need to do this. But smaller ones might actually be operating.

	  So knew, when we talked about the sales at ba san musk did the, you know, when rise when we sold equities, we were saying, like, it's like you can't keep all your money on the table all the time unless you have the the durational wherewithal, meaning you're just not time bounded, and you can just be there forever. And not everybody's in that position. An endowment could be in that position, but individuals with no an endowment is not, because they have to create distributions every year, right? They o about the mega endowments where they met a forea, you know, forder or harvard may not need to do this.

	  But just to go back to david's point, like, it's a really difficult spot, like, what is the fet supposed to do? So they're probably going to tighten 50 basis points in may. That's relatively well expected. We'll be, we'll be able to digest that reasonably well. But what do they say to david's point? You know, if they all of a sudden go ona a crazy programme of quantitative tightening, right? Nd, what is that again? That's when, you know, we were spent. They were spending, they were printing, you know, money, billions and billions of dollars going into the market, buying securities and giving people the money, right? That's called quantitative easing. Now we're doing the opposite, rightere they're selling and they want the money back. Now, the problem is, what that does is that removes liquidity from the market. And when you remove liquidity from a market, you actually make it a little bit more fragile, a little bit more precarious, a little bit more price sensitive. And so it puts us in a very tough situation when the economy is slowing, when these guys may be raising rates and then at the same time removing money from the system.
