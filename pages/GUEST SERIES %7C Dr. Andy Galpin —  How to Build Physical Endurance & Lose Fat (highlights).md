	- The Fastest Way to Improve Endurance Is Mechanical to improve efficiency 
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Endurance is about maintaining good mechanics., * Mechanical training is the best way to increase endurance quickly., * Efficiency is key for endurance.)

	  Fantastic. I can't wait. I'm going to dive in, I'm going to ask you what I often ask people who are expert in their respective fields, which is is there any non-obvious tool or mechanism or tool and mechanism that can allow people to access better endurance? When I think about training for endurance, again, I think about trying to run longer and longer each week or swim further and further and so on. But I do wonder whether or not there are other forms of training that can amplify the endurance adaptation that I or most people perhaps don't think of as endurance. Sure.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  The way I want to answer this is if we look back and think about how we've answered that question with power and strength and force production, it is really about how much can you produce maximally once. What you're asking now is how can I repeat that same quality of performance? If that's the case, endurance really comes down to your ability to maintain proper mechanics. The biggest way we can increase your endurance exponentially very quickly is mechanical. And this is starting with breathing. And so we need to be breathing properly. We need to have proper posture and positions and then we need to be moving well. Efficiency is going to trump force always for endurance.

	- Getting Your Heart Rate Up Really Quickly
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* The protocol for getting your heart rate up quickly can be done multiple times a day, as long as you have a minute break in between each attempt., * Sprinting can be done at any time, as long as you have a minute break in between each attempt.)

	  Once every four hours, 20 seconds, so maybe once when arriving to work, once four hours in and then four hours, I must be able to probably work somewhere eight plus or minus two hours.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Now, one thing I actually really want to make clear because your audience is so incredible. They tend to be really excited about these protocols and they follow them exactly as written. That's not exactly how science works. So it doesn't necessarily have to be every four hours. It doesn't have to be three times a day. It doesn't have to be 20 seconds. They literally built that protocol because it was really trying to replicate a real-life scenario. Maybe you're in an office building, you're generally there for eight hours. Let's see if you did one every sort of. So if you want to do it four times a week, great. If you can do it only 10 seconds, amazing. You're probably going to get the same benefits. Those are not the details to pay attention to. The detail to pay attention to is every so often, multiple times a day, try to get your heart rate up really quickly. It doesn't require sweating, doesn't require anything else. There's no warm-up associated with it. Again, you need a minute break in between meetings or whatever and you can sprint up them. I do this all the time in my house when you have those days when you're on like seven straight hours of zooms, et cetera. You can get out of 20 seconds. I run to my garage, which is over there. I hop on the airbike and I will just smash out 30 seconds as fast as I can and then walk right back in.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Love it. Yeah. I'm going to start.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, just also, you can just put one of those things, which I do also just put one in your office and hop over it. The whole entire thing now literally takes 23 seconds. ([Time 0:12:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/de211317-ed7e-45c8-bfc9-fcee4fa5aef6))
	- How does the body use different fuels to lose body fat?
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* When you breathe in, you're breathing in oxygen and when you breathe out, you're breathing out CO2., * All of your metabolism comes down to figuring out a way to move carbon around the body., * The neural trigger for breathing is when carbon dioxide hits a threshold level.)
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 1
	  How am I actually losing that body fat?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  How is it actually leaving the body? Correct. My understanding is that it leaves the body through respiration.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Uh-huh. So now we have some interesting things to talk about. How am I actually losing fat via respiration? What the hell does that even mean? How is something that occupied this physical space on the side of me, leaving my body through my mouth? And there's a very clear answer there, right, which I'm sure you're queued up to. When you take a breath in, you're generally breathing in oxygen. O2. That's some other things, but what's a stick to oxygen? When you exhale, you're breathing out CO2. The difference between those two is that carbon molecule. Well, one of the things that's important to understand here is all of your carbohydrates, which is that word itself is a carbon that has been hydrated. So it is a carbon molecule attached to a water molecule. It is a simple chain of carbons. Your fat molecules are also chains of carbon. All of metabolism, really, in terms of energy production, is simply trying to figure out a way to break those carbon bonds as a result, we get energy from that. We use that energy to create a molecule called ATP, which is the central source of energy for any living being, right? That carbon is then floating around in a free form, which is bad news internally. So we've got to figure out a way to get that carbon out of our system. So all of energy production, all of fatigue management, really comes down to this core issue of how are we handling carbon and how are we moving it around the body? And so what we do is we do the sneaky things. So another question I'd like to ask people is why do we breathe?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Well, for two reasons, to bring oxygen into the system into offload carbon dioxide, but the neural trigger for breathing is when carbon dioxide hits a threshold level and the set of neurons in the brainstem and elsewhere activate the phrenic nerve or the gas reflex or a combination of things and we inhale or inhale.
