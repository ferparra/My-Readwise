	  The point instead is that more efficiency and optimization can never be the main answer to feeling overwhelmed, for the simple reason that we are finite creatures swimming in oceans of infinite possibility. So there'll always be too much to do. And that's why I think the really important skill to be developed here, and we'll be looking at some concrete techniques for this in some of the lessons that follow, it's actually a kind of anti-skill. It's the ability to not do something. It's the willingness to not clear the decks, to be okay with the fact that there will always be a whole bunch of stuff on your to-do list that you're not doing at the moment, to know that there is all this other stuff you could meaningfully be doing, and yet to be willing to turn your attention for a few hours right now to something that genuinely matters to you.
