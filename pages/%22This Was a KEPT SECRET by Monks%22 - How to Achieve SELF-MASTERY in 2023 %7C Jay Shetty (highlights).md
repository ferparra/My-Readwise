	  Speaker 1
	  Like, I'll give a study and then I'll specifically speak to that point. Like, men and women were asked to be alone with their thoughts for 15 minutes or give themselves an electric shot. That was the standard. I know where this is going. They did this experiment. 30% of women chose an electric shot. Wow. And 60% of men chose an electric shot. Oh wow, I had that backwards. I would have guessed the other way. And when asked why, they said because they didn't want to be alone with their thoughts because we're scared about thoughts. Now, your hypothesis is accurate. I would agree with it. I think the biggest thing is that when we're left alone to ourselves, we hear things that we may not be comfortable with. I don't like where my life is going. I'm not happy with how I look. Everyone else is doing better than me. Oh, they just got proposed to and I'm still alone. All those thoughts get space to actually be heard. Whereas when you're scrolling, it's like, oh, they got proposed. Oh, keep money. Oh, like, you're not even listening. You're scrolling a thought. That's literally, we're scrolling away thoughts. And that gives us a sense of comfort that we don't spend longer than three seconds on a door. But then when you're asked to spend three minutes or more on a door, that thought gets to like grow and build and become scarier and bigger, almost like a monster. And that unknown of it, right? It's like, I think that what people are most scared of is they've been trained to numb themselves. We live in a society that knows how to numb emotions and numb feelings, right? I don't, I'm so upset about something. ([TimeÂ 0:23:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/af536df2-93f8-4abb-a8cc-f3e9410f7f73))
