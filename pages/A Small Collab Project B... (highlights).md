	- A small collab project between @multi_agi and me ðŸ‘‡
	  
	  MultiForm turns any of Multi's AI workflows into a web form you can share with a link, which means you can quickly build a simple "app" by chaining a bunch of prompts together.
	  
	  It's like Google Forms w GPT3 + Stable Diffusion! https://t.co/RLJGk12xHL ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thesephist/status/1598775089792749568))

	- Their thread has some neat examples covering use cases that take advantage of things like step by step thinking and image generation. I'm personally excited about how easy this makes to go from "oh, neat prompt" to something sharable that people w/o coding experience can use.

	- Oh, and MultiForm runs entirely on @Replit as a single always-on repl, using Replit DB! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thesephist/status/1598775093764554752))
