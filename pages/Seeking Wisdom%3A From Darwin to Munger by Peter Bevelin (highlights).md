document_note:: This book seeks to understand why people behave the way they do, and to provide tools to improve our thinking and judgment. It explores various psychological reasons for misjudgments and discusses ideas from physics and mathematics to understand the underlying reality of how we make decisions. It provides advice on how to make fewer mistakes than others and how to fix them faster. It also highlights a range of cognitive biases and how to avoid them. Finally, it emphasizes the importance of understanding one's goals and limitations, as well as the value of backward thinking to identify what to avoid.

	- “It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.” – [Ralph Waldo Emerson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1hx0ee8n1yp9ankgfzr7g))
	- Ask yourself, “**Is there anything I can do to make my whole mental process work better? And I [Munger] would say that the habit of mastering multiple models which underlie reality is the best thing you can do…It’s just so much fun – and it works so well.”** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1j726fsz3te8722g4ts2h))
	- A valuable model produces meaningful explanations and predictions of likely future consequences where the cost of being wrong is high ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1jaqr03e68rw7tgrgay9c))
	- Make fewer but better decisions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1jfeh71sc5k95jagky113))
	- Goals
	  
	  •   How can we make the right decision if we don’t know what we want to achieve? Even if we don’t know what we want, we often know what we don’t want, meaning that our goal can be to avoid certain things
	  •   **Goals should be – clearly defined, focused on results, concrete, realistic and logical, measurable, tailored to individual needs and subject to change**
	  •   **Goals need target dates and controls stations measuring the degree to which the goal is achieved**
	  •   **Always ask – What end result do I want? What causes that? What factors have a major impact on the outcome? What single factor has the most impact? Do I have the variable(s) needed for the goal to be achieved? What is the best way to achieve my goal? Have I considered what other effects my actions will have that will influence the final outcome?** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1jt9k1m2nxgpw1j1zmrpg))
		- **Note**: The key to achieving goals is to ensure that they are clearly defined, focused on results, concrete, realistic and logical, measurable, tailored to individual needs, and subject to change. Additionally, goals need target dates and control stations to measure their success. Lastly, it is important to always ask questions about the end result, the major impact factors, and the best way to achieve the goal in order to ensure success.
	- Look for evidence that disproves your explanation and don’t spend time on already disproved ideas or arguments or those that can’t be disproved ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj1kkbsv4et9k8xvc9qnm9d))
