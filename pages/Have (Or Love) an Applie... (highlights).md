	- Have (or love) an applied Bayesian persuasion paper but hate the full commitment assumption? I’ve got great news for you: you don’t need it —

	- — if your sender has state independent preferences, your receivers choose from two actions, and you’re open-minded enough to consider making the state space continuous. Then, your sender just needs (some) evidence to reach the commitment outcome!

	- Consider Judge who wants to match the state, Prosecutor who wants to convict, and the Defendant who is Innocent w prior 0.7. Can P get J to convict is he can verifiably state “Guilty”, “Innocent”, or “Guilty or Innocent”? No —

	- the last message is available in both states. If P sends it when D is guilty and J convicts, nothing prevents D from sending it when D is innocent. There’s no incentive-compatible way for P to prosecute the innocent! Time to give up? No—

	- consider the following continuous interpretation of the same story. Instead of being Innocent or Guilty, suppose that the D’s guiltiness ranges from 0% guilty to 100% guilty. Prior is U[0, 1]. J wishes to convict D whenever they are >= 70% guilty.

	- Notice that we’re telling the same story here: Js prior that D is “innocent enough” to be acquitted is 0.7, and that D is “guilty enough” to be convicted is 0.3. J still wishes to convict whenever the prob. that
	  the D is sufficiently guilty exceeds 0.5.

	- With richer state space comes a richer message space: now, P can
	  send any message that includes actual state. In particular, P can send
	  message [0.4, 1] whenever D is at least 40% guilty and message [0, 0.4] otherwise.
	  7/🧵 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mariatitova/status/1513521110146551812))
	- When J hears [0.4,1], she concludes that D is, on average, 70% guilty and convicts. P does not have profitable deviations: when D is indeed at least 40% guilty, P receives largest possible payoff. P cannot credibly claim otherwise when D is less than 40% guilty.

	- Now, J convicts all Ds who are at least 70% guilty, AND fraction 3/7 of Ds she considers innocent (those less than 70% guilty). To quote KG, “J knows 70 percent of defendants are innocent, yet she convicts 60 percent of them!”
	  9/🧵 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mariatitova/status/1513521111773949953))
	- P-preferred threshold of conviction at 40% is the same with or without commitment. It comes from J interpreting signal realisation (in BP) it message (in verifiable info game) as recommendation to convict. The richness of the message space allows for exact same solution.

	- I have overstayed my welcome on Twitter at this point. Hopefully this result brings some closure to those who believe that commitment outcome  is not out of reach. It literally took (La Jolla) VILLAGE (drive) to get me there (shoutout to @renee_bowen_lyn ). Happy Monday!
