- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Dec 31st, 2022]]
	- I looked through the 2023 macro outlooks from the largest financial institutions including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and BlackRock.
	  
	  (Links to all reports at the end)
	  
	  Here’s what they’re expecting next year: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GRDecter/status/1608937814003154945))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Goldman Sachs expects low global growth of 1.8% in 2023, thanks to the negative catalysts of a “bumpy reopening in China” and a recession in Europe.
	  
	  Banks consistently lowered their growth forecasts throughout the year, but Goldman’s is now higher than the consensus.

	- JP Morgan sums up its 2023 forecast like this: “A bad year for the economy, a better year for markets.”
	  
	  But don’t worry about a housing crash.
	  
	  Home prices will be supported by the limited stock in housing. Housing inventories are still less than half what they were during 2008. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GRDecter/status/1608937817446690816))
	- BlackRock gave a grimmer outlook in its 2023 forecast: 
	  
	  “The Great Moderation, the four-decade period of largely stable activity and inflation, is behind us. The new regime of greater macro and market volatility is playing out.”
	  
	  Essentially, the game has changed. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GRDecter/status/1608937818830811137))
	- BlackRock says it doesn’t expect to see the bull markets of the past to return, and investors need a new playbook. Here are the new rules:
	  
	  -Equities, especially growth, have much further to fall
	  
	  -Get used to living with long-term inflation above 2% ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GRDecter/status/1608937820273643521))
	- Deutsche Bank expects that inflation will be tamed quickly, with a CPI forecast of 4.1% in the US.
	  
	  They also believe that the market has already priced in current inflation levels, and equities will get off to a good start in 2023 if inflation continues to decline. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GRDecter/status/1608937821737463808))
	- Apollo Global Management already sees deflation in action
	  
	  Check out the sharp decline in container freight rates. The charts look similar for truck transport costs and air freight prices.

	- But while inflation is headed down, it won’t happen quickly. Apollo says that historically, it takes 2 full years for inflation to go from its peak back to the 2% level. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GRDecter/status/1608937825264885760))
	- One more note: The quality of outstanding subprime credit is decreasing, but not so much as to cause concern of a credit crisis. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GRDecter/status/1608937826804183041))
	- HSBC outlines its portfolio strategy for 2023:
	  
	  Overweight fixed income
	  
	  Mildly underweight equities
	  
	  Overweight alternatives (private companies, real estate, hedge funds) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GRDecter/status/1608937828230238209))
	- And finally, Wells Fargo:
	  
	  …Actually, who really cares what they have to say after this:
