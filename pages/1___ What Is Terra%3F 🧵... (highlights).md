	- 2/ When I started @terra_money in 2017, I was surprised to find that the crypto"currency" industry was mostly working on building 1) niche apps or 2) better servers (making Ethereum faster) and almost noone working on building better currencies
	  
	  This is still true today ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1432945212293144578))
	- 3/ Terra's place in the wider crypto community can be pretty confusing - purely by accident, Terra is now:

	- 7/ At TFL, we have a singular mission: 
	  
	  Help make $UST the most decentralized and useful form of money there is
	  
	  Everything else is merely a means to an end ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1432945227514277890))
	- 8/ This focus allows us to be collaborators rather than adversaries with the rest of the crypto community. 
	  
	  We don't compete with Ethereum, Solana or Avalanche - $UST adoption on any chain is just as valuable as on any of the others
	  
	  We don't compete with DeFi or any other apps ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1432945229036802048))
	- 9/ We put boots on the ground to make sure $UST powered ecosystems win - facilitating the creation of bridges @wormholecrypto, allocating capital, and building crosschain apps @mirror_protocol @orion_money 
	  
	  Whatever it takes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1432945230613860352))
	- 10/ Earlier this year, I tweeted that DeFi/crypto is at war. 
	  
	  As I see it, decentralizing the monetary layer of major blockchains (i.e. $UST) is the only way to make sure crypto remains free.
