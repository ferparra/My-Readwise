	- Over time, our ideas grow to be multidimensional,even messy
	  
	  The exploration of different connections leads to linear and organised ideas. This journey can occur in writing, exploring complex multidimensional thoughts and constructing a clear and compelling argument

	- PKM tools help me MAINTAIN A STATE OF FLOW
	  
	  Creating multiple paths that can be explored, I can escape the linearity of a regular page and my thoughts. I am not held prisoner to face boredom/anxiety. 
	  
	  A joyful playground for my thoughts is often one click away

	- Writing a large piece of work can be overwhelming
	  
	  It's easier to see it as building a jigsaw than painting on a canvas.
	  I define each piece of my jigsaw by asking myself three questions:
	  ‚Ä¢ What's in it?
	  ‚Ä¢ What point is it making?
	  ‚Ä¢ What contribution does it make?

	- Numbered priorities don't work for me.
	  
	  I use MoSCoW instead:
	  ‚Ä¢ Must
	  ‚Ä¢ Should
	  ‚Ä¢ Could
	  ‚Ä¢ Won't right now
	  
	  MoSCoW prioritisation is easier to quantify and justify in my head.

	- There are two DIVERGENCE/CONVERGENCE processes when problem-solving:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢ Discovery ‚Üí Needs and Opportunities (Div.)
	  ‚Ä¢ Define ‚Üí Define Scope (Conv.)
	  ‚ÜíClear Problem Definition‚Üê
	  ‚Ä¢ Develop ‚Üí Solution Ideas (Div.)
	  ‚Ä¢ Deliver ‚Üí Validated Visualised Concept (Conv.)
