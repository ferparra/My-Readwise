	- Here is a great exercise for self-[[introspection]]:
	  
	  1. Write an *ordered* list of your top 5-10 values (e.g., [[health]], [[family]], [[honesty]], etc.)

	- 2. Pick the top value and think of a time you compromised it.
	  
	  If anything comes to mind, ask yourself which value you compromised it for. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca/status/1622471418956124161))
	- (Note, people, activities, and objects can be values too – for example, do you ever compromise your family in order to play sports or games? What do you choose more consistently between exercising and washing your car?) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca/status/1622471421543985152))
	- If there’s something that is a higher priority for you than the value you’re examining as signaled by your actions, write that something above it, to signal it’s a stronger value. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca/status/1622471424140247042))
	- 3. Repeat the previous point for all values in the list, over and over, until you have a coherent ordered list of values that reflects the choices you make in your life ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca/status/1622471426799448064))
	- 4. Review your list. It might look surprising.
	  
	  Is there any change you need to make? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca/status/1622471429454442496))
