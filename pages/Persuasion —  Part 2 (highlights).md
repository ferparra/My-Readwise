	- The Power of a Positive Commitment
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Shankar learned that by adding two words to his receptionist's instructions, he was able to decrease the number of noshows by 64%., * Shankar believes that this change was motivated by a desire to maintain his image and not by a concern for the receptionist's feelings.)

	  Yeah, it was a police called Gordon's restaurant. Gordon, he had a problem that was at the time not unique to his restaurant, no shows. People who called booked a table and then just didn't appear, didn't call ahead to cancel. And it was a big problem for him and he went to listen to what his receptionist said when she took a reservation. She would say, thank you for calling Gordon's restaurant. Please call if you have to change or cancel your reservation. That ended the call. He asked her to add two words and to say, will you please call if you have to change or cancel your reservation? And then he asked her to pause. So, what would you say? How would you fill that pause?
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  I would say yes, of course I would call.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  And that's your commitment, Shankar. You have now publicly committed yourself to it and no shows at Gordon's restaurant dropped by 64% that day and never went back up.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  And do you think that this is being shaped by a desire for image management, that I care what the receptionist at the restaurant thinks and I don't want her to think less of me? Or do you think it's primarily about how I think of myself? I have made a commitment to the restaurant to show up on time and so I need to call if I'm actually going to cancel.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  It is both of those things. ([Time 0:20:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4f39b7b4-8ace-42bc-ad7f-ef802be6cfbc))
