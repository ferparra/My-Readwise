document_note:: In this episode of the Tim Ferriss Show, Jack Kornfield, a trained Buddhist monk, provides insight into how to overcome apathy and find a beautiful purpose. He discusses expressing anger and becoming aware of one's tone of voice, as well as the responsibility one has to take care of oneself while contributing to making the world a better place. Jack suggests engaging in loving-kindness meditation to recapture the adventure and joy of childhood, and to start the day with a simple question: "What would love to have me do today?". He also highlights the importance of creating a safe space to bring out what is kept inside due to fear or protecting oneself and others, as well as therapeutic models that can help with trauma-induced hypervigilance. Finally, he emphasizes the importance of standing up for what really matters and of finding something one is deeply connected to and giving it voice.
