	- Why Intelligence Matters More in Jobs?
	  
	  Summary:
	  I think the convexity of returns to intelligence is embedded in a multiplicative model, or the ice returns only cash out for people good at all these other things. For a lot of geniuses, they just can't get out of bed in the morning, and your stock ang you should write them off. And putting your stats on one's skill, you'd like, anei to diversify it more.

	  I say, there's a lot of jobs that i actually hire for, in actual lan where smarts are not the main thing. I look for most jobs.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  Does the convexity of returns on intelligence suggest that maybe the multiplicative model is wrong? Because if the multiplicatif model is rigt, you wuld expect to see decreasing returns. And putting your stats on one's skill, you'd like, anei to diversify it more, right?
