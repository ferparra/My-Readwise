	- Learned so much from @tferriss podcast interview with @naval - 
	  
	  1) What separates us from robots is that we actually understand what is going on underneath. 
	  
	  Strive for understanding, not memorization.
	- 2) On how to get rich: You must own equity, a piece of business to gain financial freedom. 
	  
	  One way is to productize yourself into a business, then own that business.
	- 3) Starting from the bottom: 
	  
	  The hard part of the getting rich journey is not the learning, it is the unlearning.
	  
	  One has to be willing to start from scratch, to hit reset and go back to zero.
	- 4) Make money with your mind, not with your time. 
	  
	  Judgment comes from clear thinking. 
	  
	  Clear thinking comes from having time to reflect and to pursue intellectual curiosity.
	- 5) Anxiety and effectiveness:
	  
	  Anxiety is the core of who we are as humans, and a motivator.
	  
	  We need to ensure our motivation is intrinsic. 
	  
	  That you're doing something because you love it or really want it. Noto because of fear.

	- 6) The calmer you are, the more effective you will be.
	  
	  In Samurai Warriors, the calmer person is going to win in a duel.
	  
	  Being calm and still going about your business is the superpower.
	- 7) Reading philosophy and pursuing timeless knowledge
	  
	  Learn from the classics. Focus on what is timeless. 
	  
	  The old questions all have old answers, from old practitioners who were clear minded about it.
