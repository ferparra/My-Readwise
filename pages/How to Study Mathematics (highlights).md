	- Occasionally definitions are useful in and of themselves, but usually we
	  need to relate them to each other and to general problems before they can
	  be made to work for us. This is the role of theory.
	- Mathematics is not a collection of miscellaneous techniques but rather
	  a way of thinking---a unified subject. Part of the task of studying mathematics
	  is getting the various definitions and theorems properly related to each
	  other.
