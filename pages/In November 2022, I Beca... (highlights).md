	- In November 2022, I became a Master in Information Technology.
	  
	  It took me 𝟑 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐬 to go:
	  
	  𝐅𝐫𝐨𝐦: the 1st outline in @RoamResearch
	  𝐓𝐨: a 160 page Master's Thesis PDF.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- Content Creation can be 𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝.
	  
	  But Content Creation can be 𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐲.
	  
	  It depends on the 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐬𝐞𝐭𝐬 and 𝐭𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬 you have at your disposal.
	  
	  Here is a breakdown of how to make content creation become easy:
	  
	  (while also increasing the content's quality) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1621567296266457089))
	- 🔶 1: Start with an Outline
	  
	  This is the ONE thing I want you to learn from this thread.
	  
	  An Outline is a Guideline.
	  
	  It provides structure for you to write in.
	  
	  • First, map out the core components
	  • Second, add all possible details
	  • After this, move things around and write

	- 🔶 2: Done is better than perfect
	  
	  → Focus on 80% quality ←
	  
	  If you go for 100%, you will never finish.
	  
	  And let's be honest:
	  80% of YOUR maximum > 100% of others'
	  
	  Whenever I read my Thesis, I spot many redundant or badly written parts.
	  
	  But that was needed to finish on time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1621567309973430273))
	- 🔶 3: Images + Examples = x1000 Quality
	  
	  There is a BRUTAL difference between reading texts with vs. without images.
	  
	  A single image with an example is worth an entire chapter
	  
	  Images make it much easier to understand
	  
	  Now, I only write using images.
	  
	  ↓Notice any difference? ↓

	- 🔶 4: Plan the Next day before sleep
	  
	  This was a major game-changer for me.
	  
	  I planned 2 to 3 Deep Work sessions and defined specific actions for each.
	  
	  It's MUCH easier to start work the next day
	  
	  Plus, your subconscious mind gets to think about these plans during sleep!

	- 🔶 5: Deep Work is 𝐊𝐞𝐲
	  
	  You will NEVER create super-high-quality content with shallow work.
	  
	  Seriously, don't even bother...
	  
	  If you want to create something HUGE:
	  
	  • Work in 2h-4h blocks
	  • Remove distractions
	  • Get into Flow
	  
	  Your Quality (and pace) will Skyrocket 🚀 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1621567331985149952))
	- 🔶 6: Caffeine is a powerful creative drug
	  
	  The effects of caffeine are astounding.
	  
	  For 3 months, I drank coffee 2x a day, before my Deep Work sessions.
	  
	  It made a huge difference.
	  
	  Use caffeine wisely, though.
	  
	  To make the most of it, I drink coffee only before work sessions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FisFraga/status/1621567334602412033))
