- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Dec 1st, 2022]]
	- OpenAI released their ChatGPT. Damn, it is good. This might be GPT4. Starting a ðŸ§µ with observations...
	  
	  First, it has a memory, something a lot of folks have been working on.

		- **Note**: Thread
	- OpenAI has created a great UX for collecting a lot of great human feedback, a necessary ingredient for continual improvement. They are winning the data flywheel game.

	- It's smarter than text-davinci-003 on some common sense questions.

	- It claims to not be sentient. But @cajundiscordian might say otherwise.

	- It still can't add big numbers (=914229251437). OK humans, we're safe for now.

	- It's got a good poker face.

	- It seems to naturally incorporate chain-of-thought. text-davinci-003 got it wrong.

	- It's memory works and understand the sequential nature of our conversation.

	- It's still not good at algebra (answer x=-1 and x=2)

	- It seems to know when it doesn't know something but also seems to make some stuff up. I don't think @karpathy was ever an Assistant Professor. He wasn't a Research Scientist at OpenAI as of the training data for ChatGPT.

	- Overall, I'm really impressed by ChatGPT. Chat interfaces are going to get a big upgrade real soon. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/blennon_/status/1598034732759281664))
	- BPE or whatever OpenAI is using currently still prevents spelling things backwards (as in 003).
