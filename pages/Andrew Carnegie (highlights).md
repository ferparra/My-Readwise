document_note:: Andrew Carnegie's autobiography paints him as a very rational and moralistic man, but evidence shows he was not much different than the men he competed with. Though he made great wealth through oil wells, iron manufacturing, bridge building, bond trading and other business practices, he was keenly aware of the importance of reducing costs and economies of scale. He was good at delegating, had a great charm, and was a bon vivant and ladies man. Carnegie was very good at using his wealth to benefit the community, setting up public libraries and a Hero Fund, and was committed to world peace. Despite his flaws, he was enthusiastic and optimistic and did great good with his fortune during his lifetime.
