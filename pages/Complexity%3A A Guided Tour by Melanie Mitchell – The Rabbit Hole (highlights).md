- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- Complex systems – a system in which large networks of components with no central control and simple rules of operation give rise to complex collective behavior, sophisticated information processing and adaptation via learning or evolution
	- Ants are one of the simplest organisms but when millions of them are working together they can achieve “collective intelligence”
	- Prediction of complex systems impossible as can never know starting conditions precisely and small changes lead to huge differences in outcomes
	- Seemingly random behavior can emerge from deterministic systems, with no external source of randomness
	- There is some “order in chaos” seen in universal properties common to large sets of chaotic systems
	- Dynamical systems – description and prediction of systems that exhibit complex, changing behavior emerging from interaction of many components
	- Nonlinear system – whole is different from the sum of the parts
	- Entropy – energy which can’t be converted to work and turns to heat
	- The “future” is defined as the direction of time in which entropy increases. Why the second law of thermodynamics is different from all other physical laws in that it should distinguish between the past and future while all other laws of nature do not is perhaps the greatest mystery in physics
	- Thermodynamics describes energy’s interaction with matter
	- Shannon entropy – one simple measure of complexity is size so Shanon entropy is the average information content or “amount of surprise” a message source has for a receiver
	- One additional major advantage is that a fine-grained parallel system is able to carry out a parallel traced scan which is a simultaneous exploration of many possibilities or pathways in which the resources given to each exploration at a given time depend on the perceived success of that exploration at that time.
	- Early explorations, based on little or no information are largely random and unfocused. As information is obtained and acted on, exploration gradually becomes more deterministic and focused in response to what has been perceived by the system.
	- This balancing act between unfocused exploration and focused exploitation has been hypothesized to be a general property of adaptive and intelligent systems
	- Prisoner’s dilemma – pursuit of self-interest for each leads to poor outcome for all
	- Larger animals are more efficient than smaller ones and this leads to heart having to work less hard and the larger animal, on average, to live longer
	- Metabolism is universal to all life so this touches every aspect of biology
	- Life exists at the edge of chaos
