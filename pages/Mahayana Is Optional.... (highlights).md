	- Mahayana is optional. 
	  
	  Nearly all Vajrayana teachers say that Mahayana practice—particularly cultivation of compassion, bodhicitta (“enlightenment-mind”), is a necessary, non-negotiable preliminary in order to stay safe practicing Tantra. 
	  
	  It isn’t.

	- The argument is that Tantric practice can be dangerous. This isn’t wrong, but the solution is often parroted braindead convention. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_awbery_/status/1368237406537752576))
	- Tantric practice risks egotistical manic power trips, controlling, dominant behavior, explosive experiences of uncontrolled energy, psychological problems associated with delusions of grandiosity and psychic control, and a lack of personal accountability.

	- Mahayana (especially the cultivation of bodhicitta and good karma) formed the morality of Tibet. Sutric Buddhism, Mahayana in this context, inculcated foundational social norms in Tibet, for children, families, and the whole of society.

	- Developing Mahayana view in pre-modern Tibet, was an essential prerequisite for Vajrayana, as the only available moral system. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_awbery_/status/1368238488542322695))
	- The approach to Vajrayana now taught in the West developed within this institutional context. Teachers and students have left unquestioned the assumption that Mahayana is indispensable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_awbery_/status/1368238565256171520))
	- Tibetan teachers exported Buddhist ethical training in its most elaborate form, designed for dedicated monastic practice, and applied it wholesale to Western adults approaching Buddhist practice in contemporary, non-monastic circumstances. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_awbery_/status/1368239400321048576))
	- That missed the point of Mahayana’s social and spiritual role. Most Western adults approaching spiritual practice are already trained in ethical standards and behavior. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_awbery_/status/1368240098463019008))
	- Most Western adults approaching Vajrayana have already learned at least simple compassion and care for others, often through Christian influenced cultural upbringing. 
	  
	  We have different cultural ethical systems that fulfill the same function as Mahayana did in Tibetan society. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_awbery_/status/1368240473370812418))

	- Inheriting monastic attitudes, many teachers regard Vajrayana as an add-on: an extension of Mahayana. But earlier traditions in Tibet, and contemporary non-monastic traditions, respect Vajrayana as a path in its own right. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_awbery_/status/1368240982865539073))
	- When Vajrayana is approached as a stand-alone path, with a unique starting point and methodology, Mahayana is an optional, not an essential prerequisite. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_awbery_/status/1368241162302099467))
	- Any social or spiritual technology, Buddhist or not, that gets you to the base of Vajrayana, fulfills its preparatory function.
