	- Increase desire — Entice visitors with how much value you provide. Create intrigue. Pitch your product in a way that successfully resonates.
	- Decrease labor — Reduce the work your visitors have to perform so they don't get tired or annoyed and leave prematurely. How? Be concise and ensure every word and design element is of value.
	- Decrease confusion — Don't confuse visitors with obscure or verbose messaging. Ensure every sentence can be easily understood. And make it self-evident which action they should take next (e.g. signup or buy). Ensure the design of your action elements (e.g. buttons) are unmissable.
