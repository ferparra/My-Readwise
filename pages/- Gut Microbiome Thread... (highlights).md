	- I fighted them all.
	  
	  Every symptom of gut disbyosis.
	  
	  Diarrhea, Constipation, Bloating, Indigestion, Acid Reflux, Gut Cramps, Irregular Movements, a mix of all together... you name it. I battled it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557038590545926))
	- Everytime I went to shit It felt like demons were in my gut. I just prayed to Jesus Christ to vanish em
	  
	  The cramps n bowel movements were SO INTENSE, they made me sweat and drop TEARS from my eyes.
	  
	  It didn’t stopped there
	  
	  Acne, Hair Problems, Insomnia, Soyxiety, Soypression... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557041186914307))
	- My gut was so wrecked that it was fucking up my mind. It almost went offline. I started forgetting things. Intrusive thoughts here and there. Symptoms of Schizophrenia...
	  
	  I was forgetting the most basic things. "How many reps I just did?"
	  
	  But those weren’t the worst symptom. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557043653124096))
	- I lost the passion for football.
	  
	  I lost the passion for my MISSION.
	  
	  The sport I loved since I left the womb, the one that gave me goose bumps by just thinking act it, the one that created my most precious memories and my best relationships? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557051806846976))
	- It became insignificant to me. 
	  
	  Training was now boring, games didn't light a fire and I went into the worst scoring streak of my life. 2 goals in 14 matches.
	  
	  I was on the path to losing MY IDENTITY. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557054323474437))
	- But with the last drops of determination I had, I promised to myself I wouldn’t let that happn.
	  
	  Day n Night I was studying n experimenting with my gut. I already had insomnia, why not make the best of it?
	  
	  And thank God, after 1 year and a half of experimenting and researching, ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557056819077120))
	- It paid off. I defeated em all. Mind online again.
	  
	  No gut issues since the last 2 years. The best part?
	  
	  It's about TIME I become a pro. My resuscitated passion drove me here.
	  
	  Like the legend of the Phoenix.
	  
	  Now... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557059557957634))
	- If you have the next symptoms?
	  
	  Digestive issues (disrupted bowel movements, burping, acid reflux, etc), anxiety, depression, low focus, low motivation, Acne (any skin issue tbh), Hair problems, Joint Pain, If ur Fat, SUGAR CRAVINGS, Bad breath...
	  
	  Ur GUT is CRAVING for HELP ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557066075803649))
	- To make it easy and simple for you, I created THE 10 COMMANDMENTS OF GUT HEALTH.
	  
	  If u APPLY them?
	  
	  It's INEVITABLE to have a MAJESTIC GUT and MIND. Your focus, motivation, sleep and longevity will improve 69 fold.

	- 1) Thou Shalt Do Prolonged Fasting
	  
	  U NEED to FAST. Do u think ur gut will repair if u keep eating?
	  
	  Of course not. U need to give it time to clean itself.
	  
	  Fasting STARVES BAD BACTERIA while GROWS GOOD BACTERIA and Increases GUT DIVERSITY. It's da faster way to fix ur gut 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2w5vW-X0AcLZok.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557082781736960))
	- Prolonged Fasting will increase Ketones, which increases intestinal stem cells.
	  
	  Stem cells are precursor cells that can self-renew and generate multiple mature cell types. Increasing intestinal stem cells it's essentially gut regeneration.
	  
	  IMPERATIVE for those that: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557085252235267))
	- Had a heavy antibiotic history
	- That's what fixed my gut the most. After the first week bowel movements were kind of normal again. I wanted more and I really liked fasting, so I went for 2 weeks.
	  
	  Gut fixed.
	  
	  Now I skip dinner 1-3 times a week. Easy 20hr fast. Sometimes I push it until 24hr. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557089811435520))
	- At that time I was already carnivore, mainly eating organ meats, eggs, seafood, bone broth and animal fats. Sardines, Beef and Cod Liver, Beef Heart, Ghee and Eggs were my very main foods.
	  
	  Recommended to keep fiber LOW (not remove) ONLY during THIS 2 WEEKS. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557096648187909))
	- Avocado, Flax, Berries, Grapegruit, Peaches and Plums r good.
	  
	  If you feel weak during fasting? It's a lack of nutrients. 
	  
	  Magnesium Chloride, Electrolytes and Thiamine are a MUST. Fasting increases micronutrient demand since it's stressful on your body. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557098728574976))
	- If you provide these nutrients, which are required for proper mitochondrial and cognitive function, your body will handle fasting with ease and you'll feel ENERGETIC - and not like a zombie 
	  
	  Creatine is great too. Get Magnesium alongside it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557105301008385))
	- Fasting triggers a Circadian Rhythm (CR) Reset, since it upregulates CR gene expression: IMPERATIVE for a healthy gut.
	  
	  Prolonged Fasting is the most bang for your buck diet change you can do.
	  
	  In this study, those who skipped dinner (eTRF) had HIGHER CR genes and more 👇

	  I wont go deep into the benefits here, but for gut health it's almost MAGIC.

	- 2) Thou Shalt Not Snack
	  
	  Ever wondered what causes your gut to rumble? https://t.co/m7NZhOHnbv ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557148489641987))
	- It's your Migrating Motor Complex (MMC). Your intestinal housekeeper.
	  
	  MMC sweeps the fuck out food remains into the colon, through ENS stimulated small intestinal contraction patterns. (ENS is ur gut's nervous system=
	  
	  MMC also limits the growth of bad bacteria. In fact... 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2w50FwWUAAqers.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557159420149761))
	- One of the main causes of Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) is a disrupted MMC. If the cleaning system isn’t working, eventually, dust will start to accumulate.
	  
	  Now, the MMC it’s ONLY activated after 3-5hrs of a meal.
	  
	  If you constantly snack... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557167011831810))
	- When you’re allowing MMC to clean your gut? You're assuring Gut Dysbiosis through snacking.
	  
	  We're NOT meant to be grazing like cows, we're meant to eat between big time intervals (4-6hrs).
	  
	  If you are bulking/an athlete and need to eat MORE, then AT LEAST wait 3-4hrs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557168798572549))
	- This is what I often do. 4 meals a day.
	  
	  Make sure your snack is a easily digested food, high in protein. Raw Egg Yolks, Kefir, Whey Isolate, Berries and sometimes Raw Cacao is my go to shake. Sometimes just raw egg yolks. Avoid the white (avidin bad). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557171461988352))
	- At first it'll be difficult to avoid snacking, since ur circadian rhythm it's adapted to having food between meals.
	  
	  Hence, it triggers Ghrelin during these hours.
	  
	  When u get that programmed hunger, IGNORE IT. After 15-35 minutes it will vanish. Many such cases! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557173999505410))
	- 3) Thou Shalt Eat Probiotic Foods on a Daily Basis
	  
	  Kimchi, Saurkraut, Yoghurt, Kombucha, Raw Dairy...
	  
	  Whatever food you choose, STICK TO IT. DAILY probiotics are ESSENTIAL.
	  
	  Your mental health, immune system, sleep, detox pathways, skin health, body composition, etc... 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2w51jpWEAETQja.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557185265410051))
	- Will be IMPROVED ALL AT ONCE thanks to probiotic foods. They’re that important. Immense ROI.
	  
	  Sugar cravings / desire for cheat meals will vanish too. Refined sugar Is the food of pathogenic bacteria. These bacteria can reach your brain thru the VAGUS NERVE 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2w52OiWEAYvs3a.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557200180305920))
	- AKA what connects ur gut to ur brain.
	  
	  They hijack your taste buds, hunger hormones and mind to increase sugar cravings, so they can LIVE n CONQUER your gut.
	  
	  But if you FAST and CONSUME DAILY PROBIOTICS?
	  
	  These bacteria will vanish. So your sugar cravings too. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557208124362762))
	- Now, if you're going to add JUST ONE FOOD to FIX YOUR GUT?
	  
	  Kefir shall be. The best probiotic out there. You see...
	  
	  Yoghurt has 2-7 probiotic strains, Kombucha 7-14, Saurkraut +20... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557210364170246))
	- Kefir has +60 strains and +500 billion CFU per cup. Gut Steroids.
	  
	  Why does this matter? How will it improve your gut?
	  
	  Gut Health isn’t only about having 2 or 3 good bacteria. You don’t want that. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2w53tOWYAgTuxI.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557237505409026))
	- You want A HELL LOT of DIFFERENT GOOD BACTERIA. You want GUT DIVERSITY, so you can FEEL the full range of benefits your gut has for you.
	  
	  Some probiotics are GREAT at serotonin production, but not so much at improving immune system. U need the full range. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557240659533827))
	- DanKoecillus can do great websites, but we need a WizOfEcomcillus to do the marketing, a DavidMendesterium to build audience and a bronzebacterium for misogny.
	  
	  And If you want a beautiful garden? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557243067158528))
	- You won’t only have flowers, you'll have herbs, trees, bamboo, idk Alli not a gardener - You want DIVERSITY.
	  
	  Kefir will give you that diversity.
	  
	  Another reason Kefir is SPECIAL: It's unique strains. All the 42 strains u see below?
	  
	  Are only found in Kefir mate. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2w55kFXwAIkFkv.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557256522440704))
	- Are u gonna fucking miss out?
	  
	  Kefir strains (Lb. Kefiranofaciens M1 specefically) also upregulate INFLAMMATORY GENES in Immune Cells, specifically in Macrophages.
	  
	  "So if kefir = inflammation, does that mean kefir = bad!?" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557264613294081))
	- No. Look at this:
	  
	  When Lb. Kefiranofaciens M1 colonized the gut of fellas with colitis...
	  
	  The pro-inflammatory genes...
	  
	  DECREASED.
	  
	  "What? But they increased in those without colitis!"
	  
	  And THAT'S AMAZING!
	  
	  Researches concluded that... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557271672209409))
	- "It depends (if it in/decreases inflammation) on environmental conditions of the host.
	  
	  The inflammatory mechanism, in a *non-inflammatory environment* is due to priming the immune system to potential pathogens, keeping it in a state of heightened responsiveness. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557274264346630))
	- While the anti-inflammatory mechanism, to protect the host from, inflammation".
	  
	  Afuckingmazing.
	  
	  Kefir also has Ketones, Acetic Acid (aids in fat loss), Catechin, Ferulic Acid and it's way HIGHER in B1, B2, B5, B6, B8, B12, ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557276348948486))
	- Vit. K2, ZINC, Threonine, Serine, Alanine, Tryptophan and Lysine than regular nutrient-less pasteurized milk.
	  
	  It's the fermentation that gives Kefir so much nutrition. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557282585890817))
	- Fermentation increases by >20% the amount of Thiamine (B1), Pantothenic Acid (B5), Pyridoxine (B6), Inositol (B8) and Folic Acid (B9) content.
	  
	  This is why I insist so much in Kefir.
	  
	  It's the drink of a God. Raw Kefir es lo más chingon. Plain.
	  
	  https://t.co/ADKfJgKINQ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557284469092352))
	- I drink it every morning (if im not fasting) and I break my fasts with it. My cock grows 2 meters every time I sip on Kefir.
	  
	  The Kefir strains are also MASS producers of BUTYRATE...
	  
	  Which Leads me to da next point 👇 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557287262425090))
	- :4) Thou Shalt Eat Prebiotics on a Daily Fucking Basis
	  
	  Note: Only apply this once u fixed ur gut or you'll be a balloon.
	  
	  Prebiotics r food 4 ur gut. It's like water for ur garden. Once u fixed it prebiotics acquire an immense ROI.
	  
	  They grow GOOD bacteria, create diversity, 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2w58LYWYAEZ0T2.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557299346288642))
	- Improve motility and most importantly?
	  
	  When ur gut bacteria ferments prebiotics, they PRODUCE Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)
	  
	  SCFAs are a different fucking breed. They're the MAIN FUEL for ur COLONOCYTES (GUT CELLS). Low SCFAs = poor gut function. Simple. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557302999453698))
	- Gut Bacteria produce 3 SCFAs  in different quantities:
	- It accounts for 70% of their ATP produced!
	  
	  Butyrate also HEALS a LEAKY, DAMAGED GUT
	  
	  It heals and enhances the barrier defense function of your intestinal epithelial cells, since it ACTIVATES & upregulates MUCIN2 (Muc2) EXPRESSION. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557306954682370))
	- Mucins CREATE the gels that keep tight n lubricated your mucous layer & intestinal barrier, hence, mucins protect from “leaky gut” or pathogens from visiting your bloodstream
	  
	  And MUC2 is the most prominent mucin in your WHOLE MUCOUS LAYER. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557309404155905))
	- It's the "architect" of your gut. If you have low butyrate? You'll have
	  
	  Low Muc2 Expression =
	  
	  shitty gut walls =
	  
	  pathogens shit n food in your bloodstream ew 🤢🤮 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557311862034434))
	- Butyrate also modulates expression of Tight Junction Proteins to minimize paracellular permeability. It also relieves constipation; increases the cholinergic-mediated colonic circular muscle contractile response.
	  
	  In other words, it normalizes colon contractions.

	- This is why Fiber is ESSENTIAL for GUT HEALTH - once you fixed it. Those who say Fiber bad or have digestive issues thx to it, just have a weak gut. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557331143233536))
	- The best prebiotics are: Asparagus, GARLIC, Onions, Cacao, Flax, Chia, Green Bananas, Seaweed and Refrigerated Potatoes (resistant starch).
	  
	  My favorite? Asparagus and Cacao. Most of my meals have Garlic and Onions too. Chia is based. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557333466943488))
	- 5) Thou Shalt Care Your Circadian Rhythm
	  
	  This is neglected when we talk about Gut Health. Ironic. Most of ur bowel movements can be fixd thanks to this.
	  
	  Synchronized Circadian rhythms (CR) are an advantage. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2w5-zYWUAEp5qF.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557344023957505))
	- They ensure that certain physiological events happen at the MOST biologically meaningfull time.
	  
	  Your body KNOWS when to trigger bowel movements, skyrocket adrenal hormones, trigger hunger, increase melatonin to sleep and restore...
	  
	  All 4 u to PERFORM at your maximum hu ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557346549022721))
	- man capacity. Guaranteed results.
	  
	  If you have a disrupted CR? 
	  
	  Your body is a mess inside.
	  
	  Your gut transit time and movements are random. MMC doesnt know when to act. U feel tired after waking up. U have "afternoon slumps". Ur sleep patterns are fuckd up. 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2w5_mIWEAEU1L5.jpg) 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2w5_mLXwAQeIhQ.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557373493223427))
	- U r not a night owl u just have disrupted Circadian Rhythms bro 😂😂😭💯💯 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557376202715141))
	- Your most intense bowel movements should be on the morning, as soon as you wake up.
	  
	  On this time of the day, HAPCs (High amplitude propagated CONTRACTIONS) are the most active, your body already knows that it should dump the most amount of shit as possible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557378350227460))
	- They are dependant on your Circadian Rhythm.
	  
	  So if your CR is disrupted?
	  
	  Your bowel movments get disrupted too. You start shitting at night, during exercise, you get constipation, gut cramps and/or diarrhea, you dont shit as soon as you wake up...
	  
	  Your gut gets fucked up. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557380938010624))
	- So, how do you Re-ALIGN your circadian rhythm?
	  
	  I will upload a Full Protocol on Patreon, but here are 5 things you can do TODAY to re-align it:
	- Use blue light blocking glasses and install a blue light blocker app (i.e., f.lux)
	- Light stimulates melanopsin receptors in retinal ganglion cells, these cells transform the light signal into an electrical signal (neurotransmission) that stimulates neurons in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), In these neurons, the electrical signal activates the circadian 
	  
	  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2w6B_0WQAA8VOA.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557403746656256))
	- proteins in the SCN and subsequently all peripheral organs.
	  
	  In other words
	  
	  When ur eyes receive ANY KIND OF LIGHT they say to ur body "bros it’s stil daytime act accordingly", hence
	  
	  Synchronizing ur CR to that light. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557406783311881))
	- That's why u need as much sun as possible during the day and use blue light protection during dark hours.
	  
	  Ur CR NEEDS to be synchronized with the daily fluctuations of the rotation of the Earth.  After all, your circadian rhythm (CR) works in 24h periods. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realalejandroAD/status/1399557408872148995))
