	- Commercial Banks print money, not Central Banks.
	  
	  Every time they extend a loan, the private sector gets new spendable bank deposits out of thin air.
	  
	  Banks don't lend existing deposits or reserves, they create new spendable money for the private sector when they make new loans.

	- 30y mortgage rates just hit 4%.
	  
	  At this rate, people are going to soon find out their houses are “worth” much less than they think.
	  
	  And this has important second round effects on spending and sentiment.
	  
	  Real estate is the biggest global asset class by market cap.
	  
	  Watch it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1493718999926026245))
	- It took 215 years for the US to reach $7 trillion in debt.
	  
	  It then took only 27 months (March 2020 - June 2022) to add another $7 trillion.
	  
	  Debt is not a bug of our credit-based monetary system.
	  It's a feature.

	- This chart is mind-blowing.
	  
	  Black circle: size of population
	  Yellow circle: market value of the residential real estate market
	  
	  Hyper-financialization in the US and European real estate market, anyone?

	- 20 years of QE didn't generate inflation because...well, QE is not inflationary. 
	  
	  Credit creation (real-economy money printing) boosts aggregate demand and it can lead to inflationary pressures.
	  
	  Interbank and real-economy money are very different.
	  
	  Don't mix them up.

	- 100 years of history teach us a recession ALWAYS led to a marked slowdown in inflation.
	  
	  The average recession took 16 months to bring inflation down from its peak to 2%, but it always did.
	  
	  If your money is on a recession with sticky inflation, this would be the first time ever.

	- Our financial system is built around Treasuries.
	  
	  It is so engrained in the system that even when the entire world blames banks' exposure to Treasuries for the ongoing mayhem...
	  
	  ...Treasuries rally.
	  
	  Understanding money and financial plumbing is a true edge in macro investing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1636126622733443072))

	- The bond market contains a lot of informational value for investors, but it does a bad job at predicting the path and magnitude of Fed's rate cuts or hikes.
	  
	  Dotted lines: market-implied Fed Funds ahead
	  Dark blue: realized Fed Funds 
	  
	  Not a great track record.
