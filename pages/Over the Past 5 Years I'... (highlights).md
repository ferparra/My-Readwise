	- Over the past 5 years I've spent an increasing amount of time helping companies and teams implement objectives & key results. It's a deceptively simple concept that promises big improvements if done right. 
	  
	  Here's everything I've written so far on #OKRs ðŸ§µ: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jboogie/status/1442083943096913921))

	- Let's start with the basics. What is an #OKR ? Most organizations think they know and start writing them without an explicit understanding of what makes for a good OKR statement:

	- Once you start writing properly worded #OKR statements, the most common next question is: At what level should I write them? Am I setting goals for the team? The business unit? The company?
	  
	  Here's how to think about level setting your OKRs: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jboogie/status/1442083944850198531))

	- Now that you understand at what level to write your #OKRs, should you cascade them down to your teams or send them up to your stakeholders for approval? 
	  
	  The answer is, yes, to both: https://t.co/XRBQWU8Ebp ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jboogie/status/1442083946607505408))
	- Ok, you know what #OKRs are and how to write them. You know how to set them at the right level. You understand how they relate to each other in the org's hierarchy. But you're still struggling for broader buy-in and change. Here's some reasons why: https://t.co/dTlg3tlATV ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jboogie/status/1442084945023934464))
	- #OKRs are powerful because they not only change team goals, they change how your team works. To make OKRs successful your team needs to practice product discovery and Lean UX. Here's what happens once you set your new goals: https://t.co/x3332w2rD8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jboogie/status/1442084947632791557))
	- As teams change their goals to #okr statements, they're faced with a question of what to do with their existing backlog of work. Most teams are loathe to give up on that prioritized list of work. Here's a common anti-pattern many teams do next: https://t.co/DkS4CzlsKU ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jboogie/status/1442084950543634434))
	- Next is making #OKRs work with existing artifacts and techniques. Product roadmaps are typically lists of features and deadlines. If you change to managing to key results, how does your product roadmap change? Here's one approach: https://t.co/fmzuC4uWEW ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jboogie/status/1442084952737140736))
	- Many #ux and #product folks like to use #jtbd (jobs to be done) in their work to better understand the problem their solving. This existing approach is highly compatible with the #okr goals you're setting. Here's how to combine the two: https://t.co/VjnhNCv2Ci ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jboogie/status/1442084955509624834))
	- Working further up the chain of existing deliverables we arrive at product and corporate strategy. Do #okrs drive strategy? Does strategy drive #okrs? Here's the proper relationship between the two: https://t.co/6nLUiSsor7 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jboogie/status/1442084957812412416))
	- At the top of the org we determine what the company rewards, incentivizes, & celebrates. Traditionally this has been production. These performance management criteria don't work in a world of team-based, customer-focused #okr goals. Try these instead: https://t.co/Q9FdI1AiTi ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jboogie/status/1442084959951286277))
	- Still got questions on #okr and how they work? Here's a top 10 FAQ post that came out of a public masterclass I taught earlier this year: https://t.co/I2Vbn9aoVJ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jboogie/status/1442084962342166528))
	- Finally, some clarification of terms. Key results should be outcomes. How do outcomes relate to output? Impact metrics? KPIs? I explain it in this short article: https://t.co/txLz9k2PWO ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jboogie/status/1442084964649013251))
