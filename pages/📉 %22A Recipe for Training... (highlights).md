	- It is hard to find info about how these large models are trained.
	  Papers typically include only a small section about training, which mainly contains hyper-parameters.
	  
	  I struggled training large models like dalle-mini/Craiyon so I wanted to share my learnings. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/borisdayma/status/1644359654225465346))
	- I hope this guide helps creating a discussion about best practices for training models.
