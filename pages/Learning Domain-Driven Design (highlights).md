- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Nov 19th, 2022]]
	- Cooperation patterns relate to bounded contexts implemented by teams with well-established communication.
	- The coordination of integration here is two-way. No one team dictates the language that is used for defining the contracts. The teams can work out the differences and choose the most appropriate solution
	- The shared kernel is implemented so that any modification to its source code is immediately reflected in all the bounded contexts using it.
	- one of the bounded contexts—the supplier—provides a service for its customers. The service provider is “upstream” and the customer or consumer is “downstream.”
	- A context map provides an overview of the system’s components and the models they implement.
