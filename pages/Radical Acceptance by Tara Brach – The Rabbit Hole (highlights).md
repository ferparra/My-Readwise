	- Radical acceptance – recognize what is true and embrace it with an open heart. The willingness and courage to experience ourselves and our life as is. It is a state of unlimited freedom
	- Acceptance is not resigning ourselves for better or for worse. When you completely accept yourself, you can begin making big, lasting changes
	- Suffering comes from resisting and fighting your temptations, not the actual temptations
	- Try not to classify others (depressed, alcoholic, etc) as this makes us blind to the actual person
	- When we are open, honest and authentic, we open the door for others to do the same
	- The boundary to what we can accept is the boundary to our freedom
	- Not experiencing desires is not enlightenment. This just leads to hardening against life. Being aware and accepting of your desires will help you enjoy them immensely and in moderation
	- People now tend to meditate and try to find themselves in an isolated way. However, the deepest findings come only through relationships and other social interactions
