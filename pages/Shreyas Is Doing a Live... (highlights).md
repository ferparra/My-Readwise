	- Shreyas is doing a live workshop for super-followers now, he gave us permission to tweet notes and it's been a hot minute since I livetweeted an event, so here goes:

	- There are 3 levels to product work:
	  
	  1 - Execution (Getting Things Done - Outputs)
	  
	  2 - Impact (Being Effective - Outcomes)
	  
	  3 - Optics (Getting Recognized - Perception)
	  
	  Everybody has different stack ranked/default levels.

	- If you are optimizing for Optics, you should not do Radical Delegation (https://t.co/zS1ybDB5kw) - bc other people will get credit for work that you did behind the scenes.
	  
	  (in chat: ignoring optics sounds nice until you run into someone who is really, really good at optics) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1492687647726190592))
	- Principle 1: "Just work hard" doesn't scale.

	  Principle 2: You must block time in your calendar for [[deep work]]. Nothing new here for people who've followed me for a while :) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1492687649823334402))
	- Q: How to manage notifications?
	  
	  trim channels, no Slack on phone, but respond to DMs ASAP

	- Principle 3: the L/N/O framework (https://t.co/XAP3aLGKSA)
	  
	  One overlooked insight: The SAME task can be different levels based on context.
	  
	  even just taking notes can be an L task - based on the stakes (high stakes - L, vs low stakes - O). Adjust, don't stick to a "standard". ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1492689649499717632))
	- Q: What is the ideal ratio between L/N/O?
	  
	  No universal answer. Most L tasks are proactive, most N and O tasks are reactive. 
	  
	  Q: Does context depend on origin of tasks?
	  
	  Yeah - if a task comes from the CEO, its higher priority for 2 reasons - optics, and CEO's time is precious. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1492692438460223488))
	- Set a target value for value created each day.
	  
	  e.g., working on Google Search, "I need to create $1m of value on the average day"
	  
	  Set an ambitious + realistic number, then honestly assess if you reached that goal after each day. If no for too many days in a row, focus is off. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1492694719473721344))
	- For a pre-PMF startup, hard $ value may be unrealistic, but you can at least assess if you made a real step forward to PMF on a weekly basis. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1492695101293805572))
	- Q: Do you share which tasks are L/N/O?
	  
	  No, too sensitive, but it's a good idea to create transparency around top 3 priorities for the month!

	- Principle 4: Beware Proof of Worth tasks
	  
	  "Oh you ran SQL? So what? do you understand the customer? what's the last creative idea you had? what's going on in your market?"
	  
	  more dangerous: PoW one-upmanship between PMs, and PoW baked into career ladders ü§Æ https://t.co/sbFsTFsLVw ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1492697927378219008))
	- Principle 5: Radical Delegation
	  
	  this is the second of the 2 most impt frameworks in this thread, helped scale @Stripe Connect
	  
	  Of your tasks:
	- Radical delegation is not a means to wash your hands off tasks. The real motivation: On any large enough team there are people who WANT to do your job.
	  
	  Use this 2x2 to setup appropriate delegation. Don't be afraid to micromanage direct reports - just make clear intent upfront!
