	- Scaling up Transformers has led to remarkable capabilities in language (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM, Chinchilla), code (e.g., Codex, AlphaCode), and image generation (e.g., DALL-E, Imagen). At Adept, we are building the next frontier of models that can take actions in the digital world—that’s why we’re excited to introduce our first large model, **Action Transformer (ACT-1)**.

	- ACT-1 is a large-scale Transformer trained to use digital tools — among other things, we recently taught it how to use a web browser. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdeg2tvmfp458ptskesxej9))
	- Most interaction with computers will be done using natural language, not GUIs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdg1pcf0t2eaynszfshswyv))
	- **Beginners will become power users, no training required.** Anyone who can articulate their ideas in language can implement them, regardless of expertise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdg1wt2gc8fsehcv8141s81))
	- **Documentation, manuals, and FAQs will be for models, not for people.** No longer will we need to learn the quirky language of every individual software tool in order to be effective at a task. We will never search through forums for “how to do X in Salesforce or Unity or Figma” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdg2a5z93ffewc4c6fxcn07))
	- **Breakthroughs across all fields will be accelerated with AI as our teammate.** Action transformers will work with us to bring about advances in drug design, engineering, and more. Collaborating with these models will make us more efficient, energized, and creative. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdg32n02znnqy9ss5vgsmqy))
