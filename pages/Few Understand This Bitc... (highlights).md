	- Few understand this bitcoin ETF if approved would have futures as underlying. Futures are usually in strong contango (i.e. futures > spot), so at rollover the ETF would *sell low to buy high*, and suffer Contango Bleed. 
	  
	  Assets with strong contango bleed trend lower.

	- The $VXX is a VIX ETF, and suffers from strong contango bleed. This is how its long term chart looks like. Yes, it looks like death. You never go long $VXX unless for a short period of time.

	- To be more precise, contango means
	  
	  Futures 3 > Futures 2 > Futures 1 > Spot
	  
	  Futures contracts expire and have to be rolled over. So at futures roll-over the ETF would have to sell low to buy high.
	  
	  Here's a the contango thread ðŸ‘‡

	- This is the CME bitcoin futures annualized roll yield. Should be in the 5%-10% range most of the time (I'm expecting yields to compress as tradfi money pours in). That's your negative carry on a futures based ETF.
