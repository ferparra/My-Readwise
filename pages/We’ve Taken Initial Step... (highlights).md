	- We‚Äôve taken initial steps to improve LLM + retrieval capabilities in a BIG direction:
	  
	  Temporal reasoning over your data! ‚è≥
	  
	  @gpt_index can now infer whether your query involves searching over previous/future Nodes, and fetch more accordingly üëá

	- One downside of top-k retrieval is that the retrieved context may match the query in embedding similarity, but not answer it.
	  
	  E.g. ‚ÄúWhat did the author do after his time at YC‚Äù, will retrieve context during his time at YC. 
	  
	  But the answer is found in ‚Äúfuture‚Äù contexts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0/status/1642908815199981568))
	- We‚Äôve introduced a NodePostprocessor class to help with this! e.g.
	  
	  1.First retrieve context (Nodes) from your index (e.g. top-k lookup) 
	  2.Decide whether we need to look more in the future üîÆ or past üìú
	  3.Fetch more Nodes accordingly

	- Take a look at this example below.
	  
	  With the node postprocessor we are able to answer the above question in detail (left üñºÔ∏è).
	  
	  Without it, we don‚Äôt get back a satisfactory answer (even if we increase the top-k): (middle/right üñºÔ∏è)
