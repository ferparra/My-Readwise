	- The right hemisphere grounds experience, the left makes the implicit explicit, then the right integrates into a more cohesive and enriched whole. The right hemisphere is the master whereas the left is the emissary. However, the left can get overconfident and think it is the master. The right is responsible for synthesizing and is holistic but the left’s point of view is more linear and easier to articulate, which is why it is often more compelling
	- The kind of attention we pay literally alters the world around us, we are partners in creation. We have a grave responsibility therefore to understand our relation to ourselves and the world around us. Structure and function are closely interwoven it is incredibly important to understand that too. Having a better grasp of the structure of our brains and how they interact across hemispheres and with the world will enrich our understanding of reality.
	- How we pay attention to something changes how we see it and interact with it and, if applicable, how it responds to our attention. Understanding how the brain works changes the brain itself
	- The right is responsible for metaphor. This is hugely important, this is where language and life collide. Communicating through metaphor allows our whole being to understand it and hear it. When dealing purely with language, it opens up the possibility for our conscious, durable, rational mind to own it and dissect it. Everything has to be expressed in relation to something else and eventually that something else has to be related back to the body
	- The right focuses on the gray, on “betweenness” whereas the left likes binary, black and white, certainty
	- Feeling comes first and then reason. We see the whole and then rationalize certain parts to fit that whole. Primacy of effect
	- When you stop worshipping, you don’t really stop. You simply find something less worthy
