	- Why do we make
	  guesses? We make guesses when we wish to make a judgment but have
	  incomplete information or uncertain knowledge.
	- we may speak of
	  a probability of something happening only if the occurrence is a
	  possible outcome of some repeatable observation
	- The uncertainty principle describes an inherent fuzziness that must
	  exist in any attempt to describe nature. Our most precise description of
	  nature must be in terms of probabilities.
