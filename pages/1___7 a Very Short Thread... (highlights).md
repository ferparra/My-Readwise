	- 1/7 A very short thread on good blockchain infrastructure. 
	  
	  Tl;dr: keep it conceptually simple, stupid, because the future of any good technology is meant to be seamless and boring. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kevinsekniqi/status/1512467480593285125))

	- 2/7 I often get asked: "What is your opinion on X?", where X is some L1, L2, or w/e you want to call it. It often comes from people who want to imagine what the future of blockchain infrastructure looks like, but who don't know the technicals.

	- 3/7 I did my graduate studies in the most core of technical topics relating to the blockchain space: how to build good distributed systems. 
	  
	  There's extensive literature on this topic. And yet, at the end of the day, there is one common theme.
	  
	  Simplicity is king. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kevinsekniqi/status/1512467482518376452))
	- 4/7 Building good distributed systems is all about reducing the time to finality, which is a function of both throughput and latency, while also making sure that you don't make unforced centralization errors (collapsing processing to a single unit).

	- 5/7 Sharding, ZKs, what have you are cool technologies. But they don't help with our goals. They optimize for other properties which, which neither help with security nor with UIs. E.g. storage, generally, isn't a major concern given the many tools available to deal with it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kevinsekniqi/status/1512467484498092042))
	- 6/7 So, given what I've seen to date, what is the most architecturally sound blockchain infrastructural design that solves for most of what we need? 
	  
	  It's the simple one: a bunch of non-complex L1s with decently secure bridges between them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kevinsekniqi/status/1512467485454393344))
	- 7/7 This is why I like Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Cosmos, and Luna. They are fairly simple, fairly clean. Each have their own pros and cons, but ultimately they will just keep getting better of time. Any additional design complexity solves nothing.
