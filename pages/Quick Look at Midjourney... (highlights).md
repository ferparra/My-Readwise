	- How Midjourney understands prompts üëá
	  
	  MJ breaks down words and phrases into smaller pieces, called tokens, that are then compared to its training data and used to generate an image.
	  
	  A well-structured prompt will help MJ better understand what you're looking for.

	- The Basic Prompt üëá
	  
	  A word, phrase, emoji, a letter. Pretty much anything will work. Keep in mind that the shorter the prompt, the more influence each word has.
	  
	  A short 3-4 word prompt can still generate unique images, depending on how descriptive the words are (see next tweet)

	- Here are some 2-word prompt examples that help demonstrate the impact a single descriptive word can have on your image generations.

	- Building your prompt üëá
	  
	  I always recommend starting with the basic concept first and seeing what you get. It will help you better understand how MJ is interpreting your concept and makes it easier for you to then add in specific variables and tune the image to your liking.

	- Advanced Prompting üëá
	  
	  Moving beyond your basic idea, an advanced prompt is one that elaborates on the composition details and utilizes parameters for more control over image generations.
	  
	  Below are some example variables you might include in an advanced photography prompt.

	- How I structure my prompts üëá
	  
	  I front load my prompt with the style, composition, and camera details, followed by the subject & subject details, then the environment, lighting, atmosphere, and mood. Parameters like aspect ratio and seed are always at the end.
	  
	  Here's an example. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1648052547180175360))
	- In general, MJ tends to place more importance on things earlier in the prompt, or at the beginning of a phrase.
	  
	  Keep this in mind as you play around with the order of your variables. The change you need might be changing the order/placement of a single word or phrase. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1648052550002937856))
	- The variables I shared are a rough skeleton for you to play around with. You'll want to mess around with the phrasing and order of your variables as your prompts get more detailed and complicated.
	  
	  Multi-prompting is another way you can experiment with complex ideas üëá ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1648052552611819521))
	- Hopefully this helps. If you have specific questions about prompt structure that I missed lmk in the replies and I'll try to answer as best I can.
