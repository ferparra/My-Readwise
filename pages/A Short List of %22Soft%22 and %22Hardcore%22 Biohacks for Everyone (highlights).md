	- The best proxy for metabolic health is insulin sensitivity (best measured via CGM or an OGTT) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqe2pdfean8vrr6pevx6gh1))
	- SGLT2-inhibitors >> metformin ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqe31rm0ezdtvh3v08tda3g))
	- Get a basic hormone panel done at least once and figure out if you are deficient. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqe3zvrjpsvnaj49ygn4c6t))
	- Vortioxetine (different from other SSRIs): great general-purpose antidepressant; It boosts mood, energy levels, stress resilience, and cognition while having a very benign side effect profile (few adverse effects on sleep, libido, emotionality, weight gain) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqe4g11ngpbv759jcvv8j91))

	- Do aerobic exercise at least 2x per week for at least 30 min (ideally 3h per week); aerobic exercise is not just important for metabolic and cardiovascular health, but the most potent/underrated effects are on brain health. Shoot for a heart rate target of about 180 minus your age. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqe9x3cbsvgtmsn2vvwj4zf))
	- Supplement with 400mg of magnesium per day (not the oxide form) - preferably before sleep as it increases sleep quality and/or can make (some) people drowsy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqe9df5b781g5281ff713e7))
	- **Omega 3s:**
	  
	  â€¢   Useful for metabolic health, cognition, mood; lowers inflammation; improves lipid markers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqe6vnbvsc5t53skmgek2yt))
	- Take about 2g of total EPA/DHA per day; preferably in liquid form as capsules often have unnecessarily large amounts of Vit E ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqe701e594xvmzkxd6zm11a))
	- nicotine gum/lozenge is great for boosting executive functions (preferably flavorless nicotine products as having something sweet in one's mouth decreases executive functions for evolutionarily obvious reasons); upside of nicotine is that this can also be taken at night ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqe6cy5wmhwp00z18hnts96))
	- Nefazodone: great anti-depressant if anxiety is a predominant symptom; small risk of fulminant liver failure (1/Mio.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqe4zthb9cj0eytnpzm7tq6))
	- Bupropion: good antidepressant if low energy levels and difficulty concentrating are present ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqe5487cwvkxr0bxmpykd8m))
