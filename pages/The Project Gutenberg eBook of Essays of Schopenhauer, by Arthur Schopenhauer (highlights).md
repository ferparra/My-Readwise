	- This emptiness finds its expression in the whole form of existence, in the
	      infiniteness of Time and Space as opposed to the finiteness of the
	      individual in both; in the flitting present as the only manner of real
	      existence; in the dependence and relativity of all things; in constantly
	      Becoming without Being; in continually wishing without being satisfied; in
	      an incessant thwarting of one's efforts, which go to make up life, until
	      victory is won.
