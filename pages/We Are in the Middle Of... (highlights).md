	  This morning, OPEC announced they are cutting an additional 1.65 million barrels of oil production per day.
	  
	  Here's why the energy crisis is our next major economic problem.

	- As mentioned, OPEC just announced an additional 1.65 million barrels per day of surprise oil production cuts.
	  
	  This builds on production cuts of 2 million barrels per day from late-2022.
	  
	  OPEC  is producing nearly 5 million barrels less per day than just a few years ago.

	- Here's the breakdown of production cuts by country (barrels per day):
	  
	  1. Russia: 500,000
	  2. Saudi Arabia: 500,000
	  3. Iraq: 211,000
	  4. UAE: 144,000
	  5. Kuwait: 128,000
	  6. Kazakhstan: 78,000
	  7. Algeria: 48,000 
	  8. Oman: 40,000
	  
	  These cuts were not expected this weekend.

	- Meanwhile, Russia continues to restrict oil output to Europe as the war goes on.
	  
	  Russia typically supplies nearly 25% of oil imports to the European Union.
	  
	  Weaponization of energy resources has become a major driver of inflation and this will not help.

	- A few months ago, Russia cut oil production to Europe by 500,000 barrels per day.
	  
	  This came after the European Union capped the price they would pay for Russian crude oil at $60.
	  
	  Today's cuts only build on the production cuts from a few months ago.

	- The same can be said about natural gas which Russia typically supplies to Europe.
	  
	  Currently, Russia's exports of natural gas to Europe are down over 80% from their highs just before 2020.
	  
	  The Nord Stream pipeline is now shut down "indefinitely" according to Russia.

	- Inflation around the world continues to be fueled by higher energy prices.
	  
	  The Euro area inflation rate is still at 8.5% with multiple countries seeing 20%+ inflation year-over-year.
	  
	  The inflation rate for the European Union is at an alarming 9.9%.

	- Inflation from energy alone is currently at 13.7% in the Euro area.
	  
	  Inflation from all items excluding energy in the Euro area is at 7.8%.
	  
	  The inflation rate from energy is nearly doubling that of all other categories.

	- Markets will soon react to the surprise OPEC production cut from this weekend.
	  
	  Oil prices will likely rise back above $80.00, an unwelcomed development by central banks attempting to fight inflation.
	  
	  Supply-side inflation is set to worsen on this news.

	- Overall, the politicization and weaponization of energy resources has resulted in a net negative for all.
	  
	  In a time with historically high inflation, it seems energy prices are not coming down any time soon.
