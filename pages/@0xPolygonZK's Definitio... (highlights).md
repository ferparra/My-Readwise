	- @0xPolygonZK's definition of a #zkEVM mainnet:
		- **Note**: Thread
	- Our zkProver is public since last July:
	  https://t.co/CbEnjj6qSb
	  Several teams managed to self-deploy the prover and perform some tests and benchmarks on their own.
	  External audits confirm that we are covering the full execution in the validity proofs.

	- The https://t.co/K6QpRjtZfV was deployed last October once we had a complete working prover and we opened it in a permissionless way.
	  We got a lot of experience from this exposure:
	- We have 2 external audits in progress, and they have already covered the zkProver + the smart contracts.
	  All issues identified are being fixed, and the reports will be published soon, before the mainnet launch. That's the reason for March 27th :)
	  Security first.

	- The zkProver is able to verify 10M EVM-equivalent gas units in 2.5 minutes, on a single server. In AWS, it's done with $0.06.
	  In that batch, as a reference, you can include around 500 ETH transfers, 200 ERC-20 token transfers, or 30 Uniswap swaps.
