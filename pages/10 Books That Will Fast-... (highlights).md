	- Let's start from monetary mechanics: if you don't understand money, you are going to have a hard time connecting the dots in global macro.
	  
	  Pragmatic Capitalism from @cullenroche concisely goes through the different forms of money in an understandable way. 
	  
	  Must read.

	- Once you have the foundations of monetary mechanics and macro in place, you can move to the subtle art of managing risks.
	  
	  I'd always start from Inside The House of Money from Steve Drobny: an amazing series of interviews to the best hedge fund managers of the last decades.

	- Alpha Trader from my friend @donnelly_brent is a must read.
	  
	  When you get the chance to follow the thought process and risk management of somebody who has successfully traded for large banks for a while, well...you should take the chance.
	  
	  And he writes well. 
	  Really well.

	- Liar's Poker by Michael Lewis.
	  
	  The incredible story behind the rise of the bond market from an insignificant, low-vol niche to the biggest most systematically important market in the world.
	  
	  Plenty of (realistic) traders' drama in it.
	  
	  Fantastic book!

	- Last but not least.
	  
	  Geopolitical Alpha by the amazing @Geo_papic.
