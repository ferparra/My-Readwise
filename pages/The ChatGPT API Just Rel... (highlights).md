	- The ChatGPT API just released and it is essentially outputting the same quality as the the davinci-003 model everyone is using already.
	  
	  But it’s 10x less expensive.
	  
	  Every OpenAI-powered app just massively improved their financials overnight. Unbelievable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/frantzfries/status/1631008508056424456))

	- We’re going to see ChatGPT everywhere now, it’s inevitable.
	  
	  Free and ad-supported products are now possible which opens up the B2C market which wasn’t feasible at scale before. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/frantzfries/status/1631009161730314249))
	- That command+k bar that’s on every modern site?
	  
	  Bet that gets ChatGPT superpowered soon.
	  
	  Combine contextual search, docs and actually triggering actions via natural text to api in the command bar is going to be a powerful new way to interact with applications. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/frantzfries/status/1631009689063366660))
