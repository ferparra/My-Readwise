	- Like Kant, Hegel thinks that one’s capacity to be *conscious* of some external object as something distinct from oneself requires the reflexivity of *self*-consciousness, that is, it requires one’s awareness *of oneself* as a subject *for whom* something distinct, the object, is presented *as known* (a result emerging in Chapter 3). Hegel goes beyond Kant, however, and expanding on an idea found in Fichte, makes this requirement dependent on one’s recognition (or acknowledgment—*Anerkennung*) *of other* self-conscious subjects *as* self-conscious subjects *for whom* any object of consciousness will be thought as *also* existing. One’s self-consciousness, in fact, will be dependent on one’s recognition of those others as similarly recognizing *oneself* as a self-conscious subject.
