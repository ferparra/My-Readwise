document_note:: Transformers are a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that are proving to be surprisingly versatile.They are particularly successful in analyzing and predicting text and have recently been applied to tasks such as image classification, processing multiple kinds of input at once, and planning tasks. They have been used to create new facial images, recognize human body movements, detect emotions in speech, and detect stress levels in electrocardiograms. While transformers have the potential to become a universal AI tool, they still have drawbacks, and hybrid architectures may be the future.

	- One of the most promising steps toward expanding the range of transformers began just months after the release of “Attention Is All You Need.” [Alexey Dosovitskiy](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=FXNJRDoAAAAJ&hl=en), a computer scientist then at Google Brain Berlin, was working on computer vision, the AI subfield that focuses on teaching computers how to process and classify images. Like almost everyone else in the field, he worked with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which for years had propelled all major leaps forward in deep learning and especially in computer vision.

	- Emerging work suggests a spectrum of new uses for transformers in other AI domains, including teaching robots to [recognize human body movements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11423), training machines to [discern emotions in speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08974), and [detecting stress levels in electrocardiograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09737). Another program with transformer components is [AlphaFold](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2), which made headlines last year for its ability to quickly predict protein structures — a task that used to require a decade of intensive analysis.
