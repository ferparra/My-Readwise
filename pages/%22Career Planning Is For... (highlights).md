	- "Career planning is for losers."
	- Rule 1: Don't plan your career. 
	  
	  The world is changing too fast.
	  
	  Impossible to plan when you can't predict the future. 
	  
	  Career planning = Career limiting ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1404080851563040770))
	- Treat your career as an investment portfolio. 
	  
	  Need both safe and risky investments with different returns (or benefits).
	  
	  Risky = 5 person startup
	  
	  Safe = Facebook as the millionth employee
	  
	  Different investments are better for different times. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1404080852678721538))
	- A successful career without risk does not exist. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1404080853882486784))
	- Pick an industry where the founders of the industry are still alive and active. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1404080854838743043))
	- Maximize opportunities to maximize luck. 
	  
	  2 opportunity types:
	  • They find you
	  • You find them
	  
	  A Twitter Audience: They find you
	  
	  Cold emails: You find them ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1404080855824453638))
	- Don't underestimate intense focus. 
	  
	  "The world is a malleable place.
	  
	  If you know what you want, and you go for it with maximum energy and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think.”

	- You probably won't be the world's best at ONE thing.
	  
	  Instead, become top 25% at two or more skills. 
	  
	  Examples:
	  
	  1) Communication 
	  2) Management 
	  3) Sales
	  4) Finance
	  5) International

	- Never worry about being a small fish in a big pond. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1404080859079188483))
	- Don't be a "summertime soldier".
	  
	  Summertime soldiers join successful startups and quit when things get tough. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1404080860022849541))
	- Don't join a startup right out of college.
	  
	  The experience is highly variable and can be bad. 
	  
	  Join a successful, growing company to gain skills and experience. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1404080861000122375))
