	- My favourite concept from @jordanbpeterson is "Clean your room".
	  
	  It is futile to try to improve relationships with others before improving ourselves.
	  
	  It is futile to try to change the world before setting our own rooms in order.
	  
	  Don't try to put the cart before the horse. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/euwyngoh/status/1387002161901412366))
	- Why I like to write my thoughts in public:
	  
	  1. Writing = thinking
	  2. More minds are better than one
	  3. Find like-minded people
	  4. Archive for my future self to hopefully laugh at how stupid I was ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/euwyngoh/status/1368422942518910979))
	- Writing essays serve as:
	  1. Thinking exercise
	  2. Research
	  3. Communication practice
	  
	  I highly recommend it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/euwyngoh/status/1398849531375087616))
