	- .@synthetix_io has been doing $100M+ volume daily, why the sudden increase in volume you ask? 
	  
	  Here's a thread on Synthetix atomic swaps‚öõÔ∏èüßµ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0x_____________/status/1538547273260490752))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- First, some background:
	  
	  Synthetix gives you low slippage between synths, but most people don't want to hold synths (they want to hold ETH instead of sETH) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0x_____________/status/1538547274447474688))
	- So a while ago the SNX community worked with @CurveFinance to make Curve pools for sETH/ETH, sBTC/BTC, & sUSD/3CRV.
	  
	  This enabled:
	- But Synthetix only did asynchronous trade execution (aka fee reclamation). Users initiate the trade, then manually settle it 6 minutes later.
	  
	  This is obviously worse UX than a transaction that executes instantly so it didn't gain traction & aggregators didn't integrate. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0x_____________/status/1538547276716593152))
	- SIP-120 appears:
	  
	  This lets Synthetix do atomic exchanges basically by checking the live price on @Uniswap and comparing it to @chainlink to make sure the current Chainlink price isn't lagging behind and isn't frontrunnable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0x_____________/status/1538547277949816832))
	- This lets Synthetix exchanges on L1 be atomic and now everybody can use them to get good price execution on ETH <> USD <> BTC (as long as there is enough liquidity in the Curve pools)
	  
	  @1inch integration is also driving a lot of volume to this. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0x_____________/status/1538547279094743040))
	- Tagging everyone who made atomic swaps a success:
