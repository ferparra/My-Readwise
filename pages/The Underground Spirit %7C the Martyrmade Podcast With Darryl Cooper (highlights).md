document_note:: Darryl Cooper discusses the difference between Dostoevsky's pre-exilic and post-exilic work, the narcissistic tendencies of both Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, and their inability to control their own emotions and create their own values. He describes how Nietzsche was emotionally manipulated by his family, and how both men were drawn to people they knew were unavailable, leading to feelings of resentment and humiliation. He also speaks of Dostoevsky's tendency to portray the suffering of weak, submissive protagonists in his pre-exilic work, and the more truthful emotional process portrayed in his post-exilic work. He finishes by discussing the classic narcissist trap that both Nietzsche and Dostoevsky fell into, where they would lose interest in someone as soon as they had their attention.
