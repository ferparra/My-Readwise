	- High-impact data work isn’t about churning out analysis; it’s about creating ⚡️knowledge⚡️
	  
	  This is why I’m so excited about the new Knowledge Library features in @_hex_tech! https://t.co/eDqPwaguF3

	- *Knowledge* is the sum of facts, accumulated through inquiry. It’s the forest for the trees. The bigger picture. The whole dataset.
	  
	  I believe that creating this kind of shared understanding is the real mission of a data team, or anyone doing analytical work at all. https://t.co/fL9AKiPimi ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/barrald/status/1483531166602780673))
	- Really interesting, potentially-useful analytics work often falls into a black hole of lost links and buried messages, and isn’t discoverable to future ppl looking to answer similar questions.
	  
	  @Mike_Kaminsky captured this really well in this post: https://t.co/EHiLOh0GOf ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/barrald/status/1483531168372846593))
	- At Hex many of us have felt this pain first-hand, but now see our customers struggling with it as well.
	  
	  These new features in @_hex_tech help Data teams go from creating *insights* to *Knowledge*

	- First, you can organize your projects with Categories (e.g., “Marketing” or “Spice”) and Statuses (e.g., “Draft” or “Approved).
	  
	  These can be set at project creation, and updated as new versions are published.

	- Projects with “Library statuses” appear in the Library UI, which is the default for Viewer users, so they're only seeing work that has been published, approved, and is likely to be relevant.
	  
	  From there, they can search, filter, and jump straight into published apps.

	- This is just the beginning for us as we think about what it means to create better ✨ Knowledge ✨ from data. We’d love to hear how you think about this as well! https://t.co/ubeXjssB2a ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/barrald/status/1483531188107022337))
	- Also a very special shoutout to @chesharma87 who both created the Knowledge Repo - a major source of inspiration - and was so helpful as we thought about how to bring these features into Hex 💜
