	- @msrebeccabirch @Type217 @robmctaggart @Canvas_by_Inst GPT3 is just the engine, what students will experience are apps fine tuned to writing particular assignments. Educators can work with devs NOW to help shape ethical tool usage. @elicitorg , @Fermat_ws @explain_paper are all open to feedback.

	- I think AI research tools like @elicitorg , @explain_paper , @nomic_ai are excellent resources to use in FYW. They present faculty with the chance to explore limitations with NLP in research, w/o having to worry about generative text. https://t.co/1rbCB7crcG ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Marc__Watkins/status/1589733415158689792))
