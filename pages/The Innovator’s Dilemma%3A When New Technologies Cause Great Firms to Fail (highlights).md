document_note:: This document explains that, although well-managed companies may have been doing all the right things, they still failed to stay atop their industries due to technology changes. It proposes that principles of good management are only situationally appropriate, and outlines the challenges associated with investing in disruptive technologies. It suggests that companies need to create an independent organization to compete in these technologies, and outlines the difficulty of cutting costs to move downmarket profitably. Finally, it suggests that companies should take different postures depending on whether they are addressing a disruptive or sustaining technology.

	- Established firms confronted with disruptive technology typically viewed their primary development challenge as a technological one: to improve the disruptive technology enough that it suits known markets. In contrast, the firms that were most successful in commercializing a disruptive technology were those framing their primary development challenge as a *marketing* one: to build or find a market where product competition occurred along dimensions that favored the disruptive attributes of the product.

		- **Note**: When companies were faced with new, disruptive technology, they usually tried to make it better so it could fit in existing markets. However, the companies that were most successful in using the new technology were the ones that tried to find a new market where their product could stand out and be competitive.
	- Companies depend on customers and investors for resources - difficult for companies tailored for high-end markets to compete in low-end markets as well. Creating an independent organization that can compete in these disruptive technologies is the only viable way for established firms to harness this principle. Promise of upmarket margins, simultaneous upmarket movement of customers, and the difficulty of cutting costs to move downmarket profitably create a powerful barrier to downward mobility. In fact, cultivating a systematic approach to weeding out new product development initiatives that would likely lower profits is one of the most important achievements of any well-managed company. Creates a vacuum in the low-end market that attracts competition ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrhf6kzxq6mrcmmt2y7er9h))
		- **Note**: Established firms face a dilemma when it comes to competing in the disruptive technologies of low-end markets. To successfully compete, they must create an independent organization, but this is difficult due to the promise of upmarket margins and difficulty in cutting costs to move downmarket profitably. As a result, well-managed companies must create a systematic approach to weed out new product development initiatives that would likely lower profits, creating a vacuum in the low-end market that attracts competition.
	- Small markets don't solve the growth needs of small companies - create small organizations that get excited about small opportunities and small wins ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrhgne7hb0yc534en69xh42))
		- **Note**: This passage discusses the difficulty of finding growth opportunities for small companies. It suggests that small companies should create small organizations that can focus on small opportunities and celebrate small successes, rather than trying to find growth in large markets.
	- Markets that don't exist can't be analyzed - those who need analysis and quantification before they invest become paralyzed when faced with disruptive technologies ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrhgqtvgf2fdjzfe99nqwmt))
		- **Note**: This text highlights the difficulty that established firms face when presented with disruptive technologies. Such technologies cannot be easily analyzed or quantified, leaving established firms unable to make investment decisions. This can lead to a paralysis that can adversely affect their long-term success.
	- Technology supply may not equal market demand - sometimes "good enough" is competitive and established firms tend to overshoot what the market demands. Moves from functionality to reliability to convenience to price ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrhgtkj80n7rphbdrhb6x7m))
		- **Note**: This document examines how established firms struggle to keep up with new technologies and the effects on their business. It notes that technology supply may not always match market demand, and that "good enough" solutions are often competitive. Furthermore, established firms tend to overestimate market demand, resulting in overshooting what customers actually need. The document outlines a shift in focus from functionality to reliability to convenience to price.
	- Not wise to always be a technological leader or a follower - need to take distinctly different postures depending on whether they are addressing a disruptive or sustaining technology. Disruptive technologies have a large first-mover advantage and leadership is important ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrhgxcrh7t69x033vckff2t))
		- **Note**: The Innovator's Dilemma suggests that companies should not always strive to be a leader or a follower when it comes to technology, but should instead take different postures depending on whether they are dealing with a disruptive or sustaining technology. Disruptive technologies can often give the first-mover an advantage, so leadership is important.
