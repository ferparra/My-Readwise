	  They are responsible for talking to customers. This is like by far and away, the most basic thing you can do is just increase those feedback loops and understand how much you can push the envelope on pricing. You do that with surveys, with interviews. There's some questions that we like to use around understanding the relative partization of features. Going back to that laundry list of features and kind of matrices on a pricing page, it's very rare that people convert equally across all of those features. There's typically one or two that are the main carrots for conversion, so it's good for you to understand the relative rank there and how to reconcile some of your pricing and packaging accordingly. So we would make a list of our features that we had and maybe new things we wanted to build and have people rank them as a must have, nice to have or not necessary that help us understand the relative partization. You can also get at it with like a hundred point question where you give users a hundred points and say spend them across these different features and more points to the future, the more value you're assigning to it. This is to get to like the demand for the features and functionality that you've created. So that's sort of first step one, is understanding like what people actually want and making sure that, you know, they're not just saying everything but the kitchen sink, but they're actually getting a good sense for what's most important to them. And then the other side is understanding their willingness to pay. I'd say the easiest on ramps here for companies to start digging into that is to use Van Westendorp's method here, ([TimeÂ 0:20:31](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cbb8c7e9-2f3b-4da9-b741-4a9477ba9404))
