	- Installing a Rolls Royce engine in a  Hyundai can make it inoperable. This  explains why benchmarking has almost always failed.
	- Systems thinking  is holistic; it attempts to derive understanding of parts from the behavior  and properties of wholes, rather than  derive the behavior and properties of  wholes from those of their parts. Disciplines are taken by science to represent different parts of the reality we  experience.
	- Improving the performance of the parts of a system taken separately will not necessarily improve the performance of the whole; in fact, it may harm the whole.
	- Problems are not disciplinary in nature but are holistic.
	- The best thing that can be done to a problem is not to solve it but to  dissolve it.
	- The educational system is not dedicated to produce learning by students,  but teaching by teachersâ€”and teaching is a major obstruction to learning.
