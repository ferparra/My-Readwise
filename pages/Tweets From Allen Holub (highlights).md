	- Educating a team slows you down for a week or two. Not educating the team slows you down forever. Time spent in learning is never wasted. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1134704667328335873))
	- Much of an org’s agility (and speed) comes from team autonomy. The team releases, gets feedback, makes a product decision, makes the change, releases. No third parties. No bureaucracy. No dependencies. No delays. 
	  
	  Agility withers in the face of control. You can’t have both. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1402430506948460547))
	- Something to try: Date every item you put on your backlog. If it’s been there >6 months, it will never be implemented. Trash it. If it’s important it will come back.
	  
	  After that’s had some time to percolate, do the same thing again, but >3 months, then >1 month. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1407160252517150729))
	- The best way to make a good impression in an interview is to relax and be yourself. The best way to relax is to not care whether or not you get the job. Easy to say, of course, but there you go. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1409670741432279041))
	- Even paper prototyping is a waste of time. The "Design Thinking" people have just got it wrong when they imagine that they’re saving time by doing that. People don’t know what they want until they get working software in their hands. No amount of paper prototyping does that. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1433832682832625664))
	- Waterfall is about phased gates. Do X, then do Y. An up-front UX-design process is waterfall at it’s worst. It’s better to work collaboratively. Do both at the same time. Sit together at one computer (or do the same remotely). UX is _part_ of dev, not a separate activity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1433862642221780993))
	- "in knowledge work, the correlation between effort and outcomes is almost non-existent." @failfastmoveon ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1439697710878052355))
	- I’m not a big fan of MoSCoW ranking (Must/Should/Could/Won’t have). To me it’s more binary. If it’s not "must have," toss it. Those other categories do nothing but swell the backlog with low-priority work we’ll never get to. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1442586641340801027))
	- The main problem with "root cause analysis" is that, more often than not, there’s more than one "root cause," and those factors interact with one another in complex ways. It’s simplistic to believe that all problems can be resolved to a single root cause. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1454867664657162240))
	- An MVP is an experiment that tests the hypothesis that something’s worth building. It is NOT Version 1 of a product. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1479181061938503688))

	- So, you're using Fibonacci story points? Here's the perfect tool! Estimate away.
