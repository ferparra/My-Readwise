	- If a single company has 74% of the market, the market has become an effective monopoly. For a startup, thatâ€™s an unnassailable position for a head-on assault. (think Microsoft).
	  If the combined market share for the market leader and second-ranking company is greater than 74% and the first company is within 1.7 times the share of the second, it means the market is held by a duopoly. This is also an unassailable position for a startup to attack.
	  If a company has 41% market shar and at least 1.7 times the market share of the next largest company, it is the market leader. For a startup, this too is a very difficult market to enter. Markets with a clear market leader are, for a startup an opportunity for resegmentation.
	  If the biggest player in a market has at least a 26% market share, the market is unstable, with a strong possibility of abrupt shifts in the company rankings. Here there may be some entry opportunities.
	  If the biggest player has less than 26% market share, it has no real impact in influencing the market. Startups who want to enter an existing market find these the easiest to penetrate.
