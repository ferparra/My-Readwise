	- Everyone's abuzz re: nuclear fusion.
	  
	  It‚Äôs fun to get excited by the headlines: 
	  ‚Ä¢ Limitless energy!
	  ‚Ä¢ A panacea for our problems! 
	  ‚Ä¢ The U.S. is still the üêê at innovation!
	  
	  While amazing, the latest news doesn't mean any of those things. Let's break down the 'breakthrough':

	- You may have seen the headlines. Or the breathless tweets. 
	  
	  Researchers at the National Ignition Facility ('NIF') at achieved a "breakthrough" in nuclear fusion. 
	  
	  They did so using the world's largest laser to bombard a perfectly spherical pellet of hydrogen plasma. Badass! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickvanosdol/status/1603071033543720960))
	- In general, nuclear fusion seeks to replicate the Sun‚Äôs power. 
	  
	  When particles fuse, they release energy. 
	  
	  In the core of the Sun, nuclear fusion reactions are ongoing, w/ hydrogen atoms fusing into helium atoms.
	  
	  When atoms fuse, they release energy.

	- If you get nothing else out of today‚Äôs newsletter, let it be this. 
	  
	  Several unique approaches aim to create and control fusion reactions *on Earth.* 
	  
	  When people say ‚Äònuclear fusion,‚Äô beyond the basics, they may be referring to *very* different processes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickvanosdol/status/1603071047200538626))
	- 2 main approaches for fusion on Earth = magnetic confinement & inertial confinement.
	  
	  Inertial confinement involves holding the target plasma in a containment capsule & bombarding it w/ lasers or other devices to stimulate fusion.
	  
	  That's what the NIF works on (in this room üëá)

	- Notably, most private firms pursuing commercial fusion energy don't do inertial confinement.
	  
	  Inertial confinement is a *discrete* process; fusion happens when the lasers fire.
	  
	  To build a power plant w/ inertial confinement, you'd need to fire lasers many times a minute. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickvanosdol/status/1603071058046853121))
	- Rather, most private firms work on some version of magnetic confinement fusion.
	  
	  Their processes use magnets to create & confine a *continuous* plasma in which fusion can occur.
	  
	  If electricity is your end goal, all else equal, a continuous process is much preferrable.

	- So what did NIF actually achieve?
	  
	  They achieved what's dubbed 'fusion ignition,' i.e., creating a self-sustaining burning plasma. 
	  
	  They fired 2.05 megajoules (MJ) of energy into a target via laser & reaped 3.15 MJ of fusion energy output 
	  
	  That's ~150% yield at the target level ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickvanosdol/status/1603071071191801856))
	- Notably, this ignition / net energy gain is also *only* at the level of the target.
	  
	  Powering up the laser itself required 300 MJ ‚Äòfrom the wall,‚Äô as it were.
	  
	  The result was a ~2 MJ laser shot that produced ~3 MJ of energy. Still a net loss of energy at the system level. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickvanosdol/status/1603071074903752704))
	- Is this an important milestone? 
	  
	  Yes, ignition is in the National 'Ignition' Facility's name, after all.
	  
	  But it doesn't mean all that much for the roadmap to a nuclear fusion power plant. As we've noted, most firms on that path don't work on inertial confinement! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickvanosdol/status/1603071078687035394))
	- Dr. Kim Budil, director of the LLNL, noted the timeline to commercialization remains long herself in the press conference where the results were announced:

	- Further, private firms working on magnetic confinement don‚Äôt typically disclose much at all about where they‚Äôre at. 
	  
	  I spoke to one representative of a magnetic fusion firm yesterday & they noted it‚Äôs ‚Äòdefinitely possible‚Äô firms have achieved energy gain & didn't say anything. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickvanosdol/status/1603071084546621441))
	- In sum? 
	  
	  What NIF accomplished is definitely an amazing feat of physics. 
	  
	  It requires insane lasers, diagnostic tech, *perfectly spherical* fuel pellets, & much more.
	  
	  But it's not *all* that relevant for fusion processes that might generate electricity for the grid soonest. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickvanosdol/status/1603071087117492224))
	- IMO, it's important not to overhype or mischaracterize these types of advances.
	  
	  The first cleantech movement this century ended in an ugly bust.
	  
	  Clear comms & balanced expectations should help ensure that doesn't happen again decade. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickvanosdol/status/1603071089588027398))
	- @WilliamMegenney 4) Fusion releases energy, expanding the plasma. 
	  
	  5) As the plasma expands, it ‚Äòpushes‚Äô back on the magnetic field. Changes in the magnetic field create current / electricity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nickvanosdol/status/1603163011652395008))
