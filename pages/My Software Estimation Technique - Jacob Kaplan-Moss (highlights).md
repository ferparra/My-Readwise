	- Break down work into less-complex tasksEstimate uncertaintyDo the math to get expected- and worst-case estimatesRefine, if neededTrack your accuracy, so you can improve over time
	- Spikes are a concept from agile software development specifically designed for these sorts of cases. The idea is that you spend a bit of time exploring a potential solution, usually by diving in and writing some software. Sometimes the spike ends up becoming part of your project, but more often it‚Äôs throw-away code designed to just prove a point.
	- Program Evaluation and Review Technique: PERT is a system that‚Äôs very close to the one I‚Äôve presented above. PERT asks you to make three estimates: pessimistic (P), optimistic (O), and most likely (M).
	- Evidence-based scheduling takes a radically different approach to estimation. Instead of starting with estimates, you start with work: dive in without an estimate at first, and track tasks/stories, their sizes, and how long they _actually__ take as you go
	- Fruit-salad scrum is a somewhat silly alternative to story points or t-shirt sizes. But if you look past the jokes, it captures something that neither points nor shirt sizes do: it also captures uncertainty! It does this with a single axis: complexity and uncertainty both increase as the fruit gets bigger (i.e. the üçâ watermelon is a task that‚Äôs large and uncertain)
