	- 2/ 🤓I spend my days geeking out with ridiculously talented people. Founders have such infectious energy.  I'm inspired by their ambitions. People are *literally* trying to change the world🌎. I'm so lucky to be doing this work. Find a job where you don't have the sunday scaries. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BigMekaStyle/status/1398279942324985860))
	- 3/ 👯‍♀️Some say VC can be lonely. It doesn't have to be. Join a team where folks have your back - professionally and personally. Find people who will pump you up when you're doubting yourself AND give you shit when you think you've got it mostly figured out.

	- 4/ 🤷‍♂️ Don't be afraid to admit when that you don't have the answer or that you were wrong earlier. I don't know is so much more powerful than BSing your way through a half-baked explanation. Trust, transparency, and honesty are the foundation of the best relationships. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BigMekaStyle/status/1398279950201888776))
	- 5/ Bring your whole self to work -- every damn day. Be yourself. Let people see your weird and goofy side. Life is  hard enough without trying to be what others want you to be. Don't try to win Best Actor 🏆. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BigMekaStyle/status/1398279953804718082))
	- 6/ ⏰ Time is your most scarce resource. Analyze how you are actually spending time and how you wish you were. The 80/20 rule usually applies. Find that 20 and get comfortable pushing back and saying no. FOMO was so 2010s. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BigMekaStyle/status/1398279957592166400))
	- 7/ Don't get caught thinking about life as a zero-sum game where there are winners and losers. Invest in grow the market (vs take share) companies and people. Don't be transactional. Make short-term sacrifices for long-term gains 💪. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BigMekaStyle/status/1398279961539092484))
	- 8/ 🔋 Happy Memorial Day ya'll. If you can, use the long weekend for pampering and self-care. Take some time to decompress and recharge your batteries . You can find me --> ☀️🛩 🏌️‍♂️🚴 🍷 📚 . ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BigMekaStyle/status/1398279965309763586))
