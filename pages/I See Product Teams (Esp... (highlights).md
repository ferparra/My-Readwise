	- I see product teams (esp. [[Scrum]]) build [[product]] when their [[feedback loop]] is the same size as their [[sprint]]. As a result, they only find out whether they delivered [[value]] at the start of the next sprint.
	  
	  And if they didn't, now they're one sprint behind the [[roadmap]]. Oops!

	- There are many possible points of failure: the discovery didn't size the opportunity right, the design didn't address the opportunity well, the delivery didn't match the design closely enough.
	  
	  But they all lead to the same thing: the sprint didn't deliver value. What now?

	- It makes far more sense to plan work & size your timeboxes so that the feedback loop has time to cycles multiple times. Then you don't fall into the trap of assuming that the delivered output is a perfect fit for the discovered opportunity and have the time to get it right.

	- This means:
	- In the 1st scenario, deadline is the enemy. To keep pace with the schedule, the team must fix sprint 1's work while also finishing sprint 2's work.
	  
	  In the 2nd, deadline is a friend. Every cycle gets us closer to "perfect" but we never race towards "done".

	- This is especially important when trying to reconcile [[Scrum]] ("we ship value every sprint") with the notion that there is no such thing as valuable software, only valuable use of the software - so you can't *know* it's valuable up-front.

	- The key distinction between "just do shorter sprints" is that the feedback loops stacked inside one sprint are intended to *iterate on the same thing* until we hit our threshold for the definition of good. We don't move on without confirming that the foundation is sound. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/PavelASamsonov/status/1507427543615430671))
	- This is a departure from the Lean "skateboard" diagram that has confused a generation of PMs. An entire sprint spent on a skateboard that doesn't satisfy customer needs is a really expensive way to learn when you could've found out in the 1st feedback loop
