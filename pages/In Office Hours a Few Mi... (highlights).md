	- In office hours a few minutes ago, I was discussing homoclinic tangles with one of my students, and I pulled one of the books by Abraham and Shaw off the shelf to show this image. I'd forgotten how marvelous these books are for gaining intuition.

	- There are four books by Abraham and Shaw, each of them wonderful, especially for people who like to visualize things. The earlier tweet in this thread borrowed an image from this book, the third in the four-volume series.
