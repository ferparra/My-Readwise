	- — please make sure to download the right TOR browser. i used this app (first photo). i think others are facing problem accessing zlib bc they downloaded the wrong browser (second photo). i tried using it earlier and it’s not working.

	- — hey there! this one’s a shortcut if you just want to connect your zlib in telegram without going through TOR. you can also sign up here if you still don’t have an account in zlib. hope it works!!!
