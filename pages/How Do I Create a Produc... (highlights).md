	- How do I create a Product Strategy when all the CEO gives me is a revenue target?
	  
	  Lots of people have been asking me this recently, so let's get into it. A thread ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jackiebo/status/1519415770559639552))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- At good product strategy has 3 parts: Vision (inspiring picture of the future), Framework (target market and what it takes to win, including pillars, principals, etc), Roadmap (not a commitment, a wake-up call to see what it takes to achieve the vision in N years) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jackiebo/status/1519415772011175937))
	- As a product leader, you need to drive the conversations to connect the dots between the business goals and the product work. There will be a lot of hidden assumptions from both you & the CEO, and you need to get those from implicit to explicit. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jackiebo/status/1519415773155930112))
	- A good way to start is to think of at least two different strategic approaches that could achieve the business goal. For example, will you increase revenue by bringing in new paying customers or getting existing customers to pay more? If new customers, from which market?

	- Then, put on your product hat and think of the top customer problems you want to solve. For each, brainstorm ways that solving the problem could achieve the business goal. Which one does it best? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jackiebo/status/1519415775408271365))
	- If you & the CEO are on the same page, you can propose a strategy built around the customer problem & solution approach that you think is best. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jackiebo/status/1519415776540651521))
	- If not, explore your proposal and their preference in depth. What difference in  assumptions, information, or values are causing you to disagree? Can it be tested? This is where the CEO might have an unstated belief about the kind of company they're trying to build. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jackiebo/status/1519415777727709185))
	- Once you come to alignment, record all that hard work in the strategic framework. Write down the principals that resolve your disagreement. And it's okay if your strategy is "test this approach for 6 months and then revisit based on results." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jackiebo/status/1519415778851778560))
