	- “The art of life is a constant readjustment to our surroundings” ~ Kakuzo Okakura
	- “Where we are free to act we are also free to refrain from acting, and where we are able to say no we are also able to say yes; if therefore we are responsible for doing a thing when to do it is right, we are also responsible for not doing it when not to do it is wrong…” ~ Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics Book III
	- “…Nature produced us related to one another, since she created us from the same source and to the same end. She engendered in us mutual affection, and made us prone to friendships. She established fairness and justice; according to her ruling, it is more wretched to commit than to suffer injury. Through her orders, let our hands be ready for all that needs to be helped… Let us possess things in common. Our relations with one another are like a stone arch,  which would collapse if the stone did not mutually support each other. …” ~ Seneca, Letters from a Stoic 95: 52-53
	- “As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light of meaning in the darkness of mere being.” ~ Carl Jung, Memories, Dream, Reflections
	- “We are made of star stuff.” ~ Carl Sagan, The Cosmic Connection: An Extraterrestrial Perspective
