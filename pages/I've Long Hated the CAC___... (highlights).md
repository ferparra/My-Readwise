	- I've long hated the CAC/LTV framework (particularly for consumer businesses). Because it’s so tied with creating a structural dependency on Google & Facebook it isn’t only a poor framework, it can lull you into mediocrity. My raw notes over the years of addressing this topic: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391777487581185))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- It presumes you have a CAC at all. Shouldn’t great products inspire customers to market for you? Far more interesting to know the answer to that than optimizing Google & FB spend. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391779324657669))
	- All of the time & energy around optimizing CAC could be spent on improving the product or lowering the price (which consumer tend to love and often share with others). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391781010812928))
	- When you have a ‘good’ CAC product, eng, design, pr, bd focus less ruthlessly on cheaper sources of acquisition. The metric tends to put full ownership in marketing rather than across the business. Under the hood, you create a single point of failure built on Google & Facebook. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391782650851328))
	- Customers from Google, Facebook, other paid means of acquiring customers always have higher churn and usually spend less than organically acquired customers. So, its expensive, time intensive to optimize, and is responsible for a small percent of your new *retained* customers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391784232079360))
	- By default the calculation is: (‘Customers you’ve paid for that have bought 1 time’ + ‘Organic new customers who’ve bought 1 time’)/‘Total amount spent’. Obviously this means nothing since value is created by repeat customers & it hides the real costs by inflating the numerator ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391785972740096))
	- A retained customer is the only valuable customer, but how does a startup know what % of new customers retain early in life? It can change dramatically over time. Keeping 20% vs 35% of new customers for the long term would lead you to totally different spend thresholds. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391787604283392))
	- If your stated CAC is $25, retention is 25% and paid marketing accounts for 25% of your new customers, your retained customer cost from marketing spend is $25/(.25*.25) = $400. Slightly different than $25. The blending, again, makes it misleading to the point of useless. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391789206482944))
	- You'll get new customers who aren’t technically attributed to paid marketing that your paid marketing team will claim credit for. You spend lots of time second guessing yourself as to whether this number is 10% or 80%. Nobody knows, but in my experience its closer to 0%. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391790838050816))
	- Not all customers are equal. Averaging them defocuses you. CAC is inherently a blend of high value and low value customers, so it doesn’t tell you much. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391792452874240))
	- A consumer businesses job is aggregating consumers as cheaply as possible. By buying those customers from someone who can aggregate them less expensively, you can only raise prices or increase revenue/customer to create more value. Raising prices opens you to competition. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391794000572416))
	- Anyone who can raise money can spend on Google & Facebook. When it works everyone does it then it stops working. This happens quickly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391795531472896))
	- LTV means ‘Lifetime Value’. People really mean ‘Time to payback based on a hypothetical gross margin’. In early days, you don’t know the customer ‘life’ or your eventual 'value' expressed as cumulative gross profit, so just based on that the calculation is useless. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391796961730561))
	- If you think your customers have a limited lifetime, you will eventually run out of customers so measuring LTV implies you have a product or business model problem. Another reason why it’s useless as a key metric. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391798417137664))
	- LTV, again, is an average. It’s not instructive to blend the value of your customers together. Where do I find more high value customers and where do they come from? ...are the questions you should be asking. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391799994195970))
	- You only know true LTV when a customer is ‘dead’. It’s an estimate up until that point. Kind a pessimistic way to view anticipated behavior. Why would a business with a predictable time of customer death be highly valuable? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391801500028928))
	- Overall, in my experience best business get really nuanced with their understanding of where to invest limited capital and avoid widely accepted frameworks for measurement. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jdroege/status/1540391802976382977))
