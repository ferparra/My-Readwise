- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Feb 4th, 2023]]
	- Popper’s contribution to the philosophy of science is his doctrine of ‘falsificationism’, according to which science proceeds by formulating hypotheses and attempting to falsify them by experimental tests. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdgd7h5bcr755tnyxdr68he))
	- it is impossible to demonstrate, with certainty, that any given hypothesis is true; that is, to ‘verify’ it conclusively ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdggfgvqdr72nhtcde1vp7r))
	- Falsificationism is Popper’s response to the ‘verificationism’ espoused by the Vienna Circle, which met in Popper’s home city in the years before World War Two. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdggvvmv76cg3k5gz9ma0d4))
	- portrays the scientist as having to exercise certain virtues: creativity and imagination in the formulation of theories and hypotheses, as well as in devising experiments with which to test them; critical rationality in the assessment of theories and other claims; the toleration required to recognise that other peoples’ theories could be rivals to your own. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdghp9cgx7q6yjkf7806azd))
	- According to Popper, what makes Plato an enemy of the open society is his ‘holism’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdgja7t2fqdngkynmjw171f))

	- The ideal state of Plato’s *Republic* is thus a ‘totalitarian’ vision of utopia. With the help of his Theory of Forms, Plato is able to portray it as the rational state, the state within which everything runs smoothly, like a well-oiled machine, thanks to the way everyone concentrates on the job he, or she, is best equipped to do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdgk5bhg5v98v5xrtb5vs02))

	- Popper argues that there can be no uniquely ‘rational state’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdgmefqvfqv8qvytxvhg2at))
	- the philosophical sin of which Hegel and Marx are held to be guilty is ‘historicism’, the doctrine that history must take a certain course. According to Popper, utopianism and historicism are both flawed because both are inimical to the only approach it is, in reality, possible to take to the solution of social and political problems ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdgnd3z8d9r1bqftwcd9337))

	- he trouble with utopianism is thus that it discourages piecemeal social engineering by ruling it out as irrational. The trouble with historicism is that it limits your choice of strategy. Either you can try to hasten the pace at which history pursues its inevitable course, or you can try to slow it down. (It depends on whether you want to be ‘progressive’ or ‘reactionary’.) Anything more innovatory is ruled out. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdgr0aq96rf3ad01wnhb4ae))
	- By attacking totalitarian utopianism and historicism Popper was, or so he (rightly) thought, attacking the intellectual roots of the great tyrannies which had plagued European political life throughout the 1920s, 30s and 40s. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdgry32wsm57nqq0ckedct7))
	- One great difference between our own time and the past – even the very recent past – is that ‘closed’ societies are not so easy to sustain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdgvcgpwzbpk6wd447rkarx))
	- it is no longer possible for this or that repressive regime to control its population by keeping it cocooned from the outside world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdgvv1ampks195cmr0zqt3e))
	- states are far more economically interdependent ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdgw8hvfvsp91csvbkdrqhf))
	- Old skeletons like fascism and racism have a nasty habit of disinterring themselves and returning to haunt us in new guises ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdgwrwv9cneyh5vmcgzwwj0))

	- History tells us that Plato was an Athenian aristocrat whose sympathies lay with Sparta, the city-state by which Athens had recently been defeated in a long and bloody war. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdh1ar34ddkxhhmrz03awey))
