	- The human mind is predisposed from early childhood to assume object permanence, to assume that objects have shapes and positions in space even when the objects and space are unperceived. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn3yab05atn5epzn5t9apgv5))
	- Richard Dawkins and others have observed that the core of evolution by natural selection is an abstract algorithm with three key components: variation, selection, and retention ([Dennett, 1995](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00577/full#B22); [Blackmore, 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00577/full#B8)).

	- when we actually study the evolution of perception using Monte Carlo simulations of evolutionary games and genetic algorithms, we find that natural selection does not, in general, favor perceptions that are true reports of objective properties of the environment. Instead, it generally favors perceptual strategies that are tuned to fitness ([Mark et al., 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00577/full#B59); [Hoffman et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00577/full#B43); [Marion, 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00577/full#B57); [Mark, 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00577/full#B58)).
