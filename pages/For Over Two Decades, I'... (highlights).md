	- For over two decades, I've been taking notes in outline format.
	  
	  Structuring my thoughts in bullets comes to me naturally, but I know that's not the case for everybody.
	  
	  ðŸ§µ A thread on the fundamental concepts of outliners and their use cases, using @RoamResearch as an example. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1430504270562938882))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- First: what are outliners exactly?
	  
	  Outliners are software tools that let you create outlines (duh). But more precisely, they help you to structure your thoughts in a tree-like structure.
	  
	  Leaves = individual bullets (nodes).
	  
	  Branches = collections of (nested) nodes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1430504271808655361))
	- According to outline guru @davewiner, there are two core concepts that any true outliner needs to have:
	  
	  1. Expand and collapse to control the level of detail.
	  2. "Text on rails" so you can easily reorganize based on the structure.

	- The one outliner that "clicked" best for me is @RoamResearch.
	  
	  It has all the core concepts of a true outliner, and then some.

	- @TfTHacker's thread on the five fundamentals of @RoamResearch is a great starting point to grok outliners.
	  
	  I'll touch on each one before diving into the use cases for the outline format.

	- Fundamental 1: Indentation
	  
	  By indenting nodes you create relationships; parent-child and sibling relationships.
	  
	  Parent nodes have one or more bullets nested underneath.
	  
	  Sibling nodes have other nodes on the same indentation level.

	- Fundamental 2: Expand and collapse
	  
	  When you collapse an outline, only the parent nodes are visibleâ€”creating a 10,000-feet overview.
	  
	  Expanding branches of nodes, you can drill down to detail view and gain a richer understanding.

	- Fundamental 3: Focus/zoom
	  
	  Being able to collapse and expand blocks is a great way to filter out noise, but true outliners like @RoamResearch let you zoom in on nodes and their children.

	- Fundamental 4: Sidebar
	  
	  Apart from being able to zoom in on branches of blocks, @RoamResearch also lets you open that branch in a sidebar.
	  
	  The sidebar helps you to filter out noise and to see information in new contexts by opening branches side-by-side.

	- Fundamental 5: Quick entry
	  
	  Because outlines are structured by indenting and grouping nodes, you don't need a file and folder structure.
	  
	  True outliners are built around this realization and provide a quick way to enter information.

	- Now that we have the fundamentals of successful outliners out of the way, you may start to see why they're so powerful.
	  
	  Let's have a look at a few reasons why you might want to start taking notes in an outline format, and how to get started. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1430504285578485761))
	- Outliners are powerful because you can add meaning to your notes through relationships between bullets (nodes) by indenting and unindenting.
	  https://t.co/jLCZ5Es45I ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1430504286807416834))
	- Because indenting and unindenting nodes is so effortless in outliners, it makes writing frictionless.
	  
	  Frictionless writing means you're more likely to stay in a flow state.

	- Outliners require you to change your way of thinking, but it will make you a clearer thinker in the end.
	  
	  Outliners teach you to structure your thoughts and to break complex things down to their atomic parts.
	  https://t.co/mUt2juqrrG ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1430504289802149890))
	- Because outliners force you to think in individual nodes, you can speed up your overall writing process as your writing  becomes snappier.
	  https://t.co/ujamgkd4Yv ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1430504291358285831))
	- Outliners also take off the pressure to structure your writing as you're writing.
	  
	  With the principle of "text on rails" in mind, you can easily restructure your outlines in @RoamResearch by just using your keyboard.
	  https://t.co/PWig28fH5F ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1430504292885041153))
	- Finally, outliners help you to quickly jump between different streams of thought, while filtering out what's not relevant in the moment.
	  
	  I guess this is why @RoamResearch resonates so much with us ADHD folk.

	- While the structure of outlines does not come naturally to everyone, breaking things up in components is a natural tendency.
	  
	  For example, we naturally break up time in blocks of years, months, weeks, etc. because of the structure of reality.
	  https://t.co/NHhAzltK1x ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1430504295745478664))
	- In nature, many things are of a fractal nature.
	  
	  Learning how to break up complex topics to their atomic parts is natural, and outliners help you do exactly that.
	  https://t.co/nw9Vm6h5K6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1430504297247121413))
	- If the structure of outlines does not seem natural to you, try to find examples of outlines in your life and see their usefulness.
	  
	  A table of contents in a book is an example of an outline.

	- If you've ever sketched, created a mindmap, or a bullet journal, you've worked with an outline structure.
	  
	  What makes an outline is not the direction in which information flows (top to bottom, or left to right), but how its relations are formed.

	- Outliners with collapsable blocks and branches allow you to go from high-level overview to details in a matter of seconds.
	  
	  @RoamResearch's multibar is an excellent example of collapsing and expanding done right.

	- Being able to filter out details helps you to think clearly.
	  
	  Being able to drill down to the details helps you to think precisely.

	- While outlines and outliners are powerful, you need to be careful when to use them.
	  
	  Don't turn them into a hammer and treat everything as a nail.
	  
	  Outliners are perfect for non-linear writing, but for linear writing a document is better suited.
	  
	  Use the right tool for the job. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1430504304574537731))
