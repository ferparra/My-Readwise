	- Most people f*ck up meetings. 
	  
	  We spend ~12 hours/wk in them. 
	  
	  We spend 3 years of our career in them. 
	  
	  Yet we don't do anything to make meetings better. 
	  
	  Here are 6 ways to fix them today ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1407389520853716992))

	- Meetings are a last resort, not a first option. 
	  
	  There's a HUGE opportunity cost. 
	  
	  A one-hour meeting with five people isn't a one-hour meeting. 
	  
	  It's a five-hour meeting in terms of cost. 
	  
	  Understand the opportunity cost of every meeting you call.

	- Cut all meetings by 33% when scheduling. 
	  
	  I hate when a meeting goes the full time because that's what the calendar says. 
	  
	  If a meeting is 30 minutes, schedule for 20.
	  If a meeting is 60 minutes, schedule for 40. 
	  
	  It forces you to stay on track & respect everyone's time.

	- Every meeting should have a plan. 
	  
	  People just expect meetings to go well. 
	  
	  When else in life would you expect results without a plan or expectations? 
	  
	  You wouldn't. 
	  
	  Everyone should enter a meeting knowing:
	- 99% of meetings shouldn't be meetings.
	- Iterate on meetings. 
	  
	  We assume meetings are great and they improve over time. 
	  
	  That's like launching a product then going on autopilot. 
	  
	  No measuring engagement. 
	  No soliciting feedback. 
	  No making thoughtful changes. 
	  
	  A meeting is a product & attendees are your customers.

	- Meetings must be preserved. 
	  
	  Meetings are ephemeral & must be memorialized for people not in attendance. 
	  
	  Every meeting should have minutes that outline:
