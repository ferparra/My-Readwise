	- 3 variables. Wealth health and time. Solving for net fulfillment.
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Individuals should focus on their own goals and not worry about what others may think of them., * It is important to focus on what will make them happy and fulfilled, rather than worrying about how much money or time they have left., * There is no onesize-fits-all answer to achieving happiness and fulfillment, as each person's situation is different.)

	  What's the natural history of that person who's 40 years old, whose total net worth is $50,000 and their available liquidity is $1,000. They're thinking I'm going to work till I'm 65 or 70 or whatever and then I'm going to collect my social security. Does this thinking still apply there?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  It applies in different ways. So what I've come up with this book is there's three variables, your wealth, your health and your time. We're taking those three variables and we're solving for net fulfillment. We're not solving for maximum wealth. We're not solving even for maximum health. There's maximum time. We're solving for net fulfillment. I'm saying that's your purpose. If you're with me, we're solving for net fulfillment.

	- The Difference Between [[Fear]] and [[Risk Tolerance]]
	  
	  Key takeaways:
	  (* Risk tolerance is relative to the individual, and can be changed through discussion., * Loss aversion is a greater motivator for some people than gain., * Focusing on opportunity costs can help people overcome their fear of loss.)

	  Yeah. And trading, if someone is right half the time, they're pretty good.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  If they're right, 55%, 60% of time they're like, think about the casinos edge and black jackets. It's like 51. Yeah, 0.07 or 0.09 and blackjack and craps. It's like 0.03. They're wrong. A lot of the time, but ultimately the law of large numbers, they make a bunch of money. But if your emotional calculus is different, where such that you need a greater being right ratio, then you're not going to make it because stress, cloud, you're thinking and your judgment.
	  
	  Speaker 2
	  So with that said, if someone says to you, you just have a really high tolerance for risk, I don't. I'm very risk adverse. I don't like to take big risk. I never want to have the chance of losing something. Loss aversion is a greater motivator for me than gain. How do you talk to that person and how do you help them think through the difference between fear and risk tolerance?
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Well, the first thing I do is just try and break down what are they actually afraid of. A lot of times when people say the bad thing is not as bad as they imagine it in their head. And a lot of times, quite frankly, it's really the fear of judgment more than the actual thing. They are finding out that they can survive the potential negative financial hit. What they can't survive is, oh, my friends, my colleagues, my spouse, my mom, my dad, the shame. I got it wrong. The I told you so, etc. There's a lot of that fear baked into disguised as I can't risk these dollars. I'm like, yeah, you can. That type of thing. Then the other thing is I try to think is get them the focus. They always focus on the monetary costs of losing. But what about the cost of inaction and the opportunity costs? And by talking about the opportunity costs, I get them the CD asymmetry of the risk. Maybe I have a greater tolerance for risk. But what I do is is that I fear, my fear is reversed. I fear missing out on the opportunity costs. I fear not getting the max. A lot of people fear running out of money. I fear wasting my life. I am more worried about looking back and being like, shit, I wasted my only ride that I had than running out of money.
