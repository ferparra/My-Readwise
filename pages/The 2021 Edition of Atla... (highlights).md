	- The 2021 edition of Atlantico's LatAm Digital Report is here! 200 slides of fresh data that tell a robust story of LatAm's booming tech scene. This year we focus on the 2nd- and 3rd-order effects of the region's rapid digitalization. ThreadðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/BHd89prRY6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JulioV/status/1440542521759723546))
		- **Note**: Thread
	- 1/ LatAm registered a jump from 2.3% to 3.4% in tech penetration, based on the Atlantico Index that measures tech company market cap as a percent of GDP

	- 3/ There is a lot of room to grow: Value creation will be measured in the trillions if LatAm catches up to regions with greater tech penetration like the US and China (or even India which has lower GDP per capita and internet penetration)

	- 4/ This year we conducted primary research with over 500 companies in Latin America on their practices and expectations for the future of (remote) work. Spoiler: remote is more prevalent and more effective than previously thought.

	- 5/ The boom in e-commerce penetration prompted advances in logistics, payments and infrastructure, which in turn have led to new commerce categories, like groceries, autos, and real estate, finally "going digital"

	- 6/ LatAm is the global leader in social network penetration and the following and influence of creators. However, through our "Creator Economy Survey" with over 5k creators, we saw that most influencers are still in the early days of monetizing.

	- 7/ Representing over 20% of Brazil's GDP, agriculture was a sector we couldn't gloss over. The opportunity is massive, but digitalization is early. Consumers demand sustainability, which has put LatAm on a path to leadership in carbon offsets and plant-based protein

	- 8/ Fintech still draws the lion's share of venture dollars (40% of total) and will likely see a second wave of disruption in the insurance sector and through embedded fintech models throughout the economy

	- 9/ As robust investors in crypto, Brazilians have also been pioneers in launching crypto ETFs on the national exchange to bring crypto investing to the masses

	- 10/ Bonus Round! This year's report also includes two separate deep-dive presentations: One on the current state of the Covid-19 pandemic in the region and a second on the digital transformation of agriculture. Enjoy!
