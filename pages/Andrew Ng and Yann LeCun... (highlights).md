	- Andrew Ng and Yann LeCun just hosted a 30min live webinar on YouTube discussing why the 6-month pause is a bad idea. 
	  
	  Here are some of the things they shared‚Ä¶

		- **Note**: Thread
	- Both think that AGI is more like 30-50 years away. 
	  
	  Yann thinks it will not be done through just making autoregressive LLMs bigger. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alliekmiller/status/1644392089990332417))
	- Both made a strong point (several times!) to differentiate between R&D and products. 
	  
	  Yann said OpenAI is now making products and that he is pro regulation on products but not technologies or R&D. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alliekmiller/status/1644392092376891413))
	- Yann believes future AI systems will be more controllable and can be aligned to human values. 
	  
	  Andrew said models are still toxic and far from perfect but is generally pro instruction models (like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alliekmiller/status/1644392094130110497))
	- Both are anti AI hype. 
	  
	  Andrew said he was too optimistic about self-driving cars and believes the media has swung too far now and is too negative. 
	  
	  He said something to the effect of - we need less doomsday hype. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alliekmiller/status/1644392095820415016))
	- Yann says we‚Äôre not at all close to human-level intelligence and that models produce nonsense sometimes, probably because it‚Äôs entirely/mostly trained on text. 
	  
	  He said it‚Äôs not a question we will get to AGI in the next few decades but it won‚Äôt be tomorrow. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alliekmiller/status/1644392098097922048))
	- Both seemed to hint that slowing down AI R&D slows down ethical AI research. 
	  
	  Yann said something to the effect of - how can you invent seatbelts if cars don‚Äôt exist yet. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alliekmiller/status/1644392100912300063))
	- Yann said if we were already at human-level intelligence, we would have L5 AV. 
	  
	  Humans learn to drive in about 20 hours but AI-enabled cars are not that good yet. 
	  
	  Yann had many references to past tech, esp cars and airplanes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alliekmiller/status/1644392102900400136))
	- Andrew said the pause also doesn‚Äôt seem implementable. 
	  
	  Andrew said the government passing laws to slow down innovation would be even worse. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alliekmiller/status/1644392104670396448))
	- Both seemed to emphasize high competition and don‚Äôt believe OpenAI has won. 
	  
	  Yann said OpenAI is something of a contract arm for MSFT and LLMs will be democratized. 
	  
	  Andrew believes there will be many LLM players and the app layer will be big. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alliekmiller/status/1644392107241504775))
	- Yann referenced the printing press and mentioned it brought war but also brought democracy. 
	  
	  Yann: ‚ÄúWe might see a new renaissance because of [AI]. Why would you want to stop that?‚Äù ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alliekmiller/status/1644392109019889681))
	- Andrew said GPT-4+ could do a lot for healthcare and education, doesn‚Äôt want to slow down the ‚Äúgood‚Äù of this research. 
	  
	  Both seemed to mention the ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù sides but no tradeoffs shared, just that not having the ‚Äúgood‚Äù side feels like we‚Äôre missing out on something big. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alliekmiller/status/1644392111184199680))
	- Andrew: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any realistic threat of AI escape‚Äù
	  
	  Yann says he‚Äôs not involved with Meta policy work but that progress in AI fixes a lot of social media issues, like taking down hate speech 
	  
	  Yann says AI is part of the solution, not the problem. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alliekmiller/status/1644392113201639424))
	- When asked if engineers will be replaced/what should students do, both Andrew and Yann encouraged students to build and get into this space.
	  
	  Yann says that AI isn‚Äôt solved and we‚Äôre still missing a lot, like reasoning and planning. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alliekmiller/status/1644392115416203306))
