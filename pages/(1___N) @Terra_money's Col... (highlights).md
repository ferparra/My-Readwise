	- (1/n) @terra_money's Columbus 5 Upgrade is happening today. Here's a üßµ on what these upgrades are.
	  
	  I'll explore 3 things:
		- **Note**: Thread
	- (2/n) In a nutshell, the upgrade aims to facilitate scalability and interoperability with @Cosmos. The major impact will be to increase the widespread adoption of $UST and the development of an efficient and interoperable ecosystem. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454596878200832))
	- (3/n) The upgrade has many changes, out of which four are the most significant: 
	  
	  1. Burning LUNA seigniorage 
	  2. Stargate upgrade 
	  3. Wormhole Launch
	  4. Ozone Protocol integration ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454597926850569))
	- (4/n) 1. LUNA Seigniorageüî•
	  
	  The most talked-about update is the seigniorage burn. Previously, a portion of the burnt LUNA was directed to the community & oracle reward pools.
	  
	  Post the upgrade all of it would be burned. This implies a +ve impact on LUNA's value in the long run. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454599101239298))
	- (5/n) 2. The Stargate Upgrade
	  
	  This will scale the transaction throughput, enable efficient cross-chain transactions, and accelerate the UI development. It includes four major developments: IBC, Protobuf, State Synch, and Chain Upgrade Module.
	  
	  Exploring each below. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454600267190278))
	- (6/n) Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) - high TPS, cross-chain txns & all the good stuff 
	  
	  The IBC protocol is one of the most significant as it aims to enable interoperability with the Cosmos Network. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454601311571973))
	- (7/n) The IBC will enable users to transfer tokens across various zones and help devs deploy multi-chain smart contracts. Since this will have a much-needed positive impact on the interoperability, it is expected that the Terra ecosystem will have more liquidity flowing in. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454602410553346))
	- (8/n) The Protobuf Migration will improve larger performance & interoperability. It aims to reduce gas costs for applications on Cosmos and 10x the transaction throughput.
	  
	  Other upgrades like State Sync, Chain Upgrade Module will help in faster node sync & asynchronous upgrades. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454603693940739))
	- (9/n) 3. The Wormhole - Hello Solana, let's build a bridge. 
	  
	  While previously only ERC-20 version of $UST could be transferred, post the upgrade $UST will be frictionlessly ported over to Solana. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454604746706950))
	- (10/n) 4. Ozone Protocol - Much insurance, less risk, super fun
	  
	  It is an insurance mutual protocol that aims to provide ‚Äúlevered coverage‚Äù against technical risks in the evolving DeFi ecosystem on Terra. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454605765976064))
	- (11/n) Other upgrades will optimize gas efficiency of oracle voting, charge gas fees for contract log size to prevent spamming of node‚Äôs local storage, and separate mint/burn swap base pools among others. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454606848106498))
	- (12/n) The promising results of this upgrade have led to several developers start building their dApps within the ecosystem. 
	  
	  Most of these dApps are still in the development phase. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454607976394752))
	- (13/n) I found this great thread by @FynnToTheMoon covering over 75 dApps that are under development. You can read about them here.

	- (14/n) As the ecosystem expands and liquidity flows in, the demand for UST might increase. Could this cause a problem to its price? 
	  
	  The unique burn and mint mechanism would say no, but... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454610245492740))
	- (15/n) Its resilience has been challenged in the past. It lost its peg during the May market crash and fell down to $0.95 per $1 UST.
	  
	  The issue was resolved during the September market crash as its price managed to remain stable.

	- (16/n) Terra‚Äôs idea is to adjust UST‚Äôs supply according to the existing demand, which is done via LUNA. This market volatility is ‚Äúabsorbed‚Äù by the miners. Here‚Äôs how it works:
	  
	  Let‚Äôs say that the supply for Terra has increased. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454621473591297))
	- (17/n) In this case the price decreases. Miners are incentivized to buy back the existing Terra and burn them. This contracts its supply, thereby bringing down its price to the peg. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454622555803659))
	- (18/n) While this ‚Äúdilutes‚Äù the existing mining power, but this effect is very short-term as the mining rewards increase long-term. This means:
	  
	  More miners invest more resources to keep the system running so they keep getting the rewards in the long run. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454623621124100))
	- (19/n) Terra's aim is to keep the price of UST stable, in extremely volatile markets this can change. We are yet to see how it adapts to future market conditions, especially as the ecosystem grows.

	- (20/n) The larger aim of Terra is to accelerate the adoption of $UST and create a far-reaching DeFi ecosystem. While they are not the first to have that vision, their technology is certainly very capable of realising it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mohakagr/status/1443454629652488192))
