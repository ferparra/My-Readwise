	- When you have a tough message to share, or when you are so convinced of your own rightness that you may push too hard, remember to STATE your path:
	  
	  1.  Share your facts. Start with the least controversial, most persuasive elements from your Path to Action.
	  2.  Tell your story. Explain what you’re beginning to conclude.
	  3.  Ask for others’ paths. Encourage others to share both their facts and their stories.
	  4.  Talk tentatively. State your story as a story—don’t disguise it as a fact.
	  5.  Encourage testing. Make it safe for others to express differing or even opposing views. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq7rf81wjhb42xk0wb53qmn))
		- **Note**: The "STATE your path" method encourages people to share their facts and stories when they have a tough message to share, and to invite others to share their facts and stories. It also encourages people to talk tentatively and to make it safe for others to express differing or even opposing views.
	- To encourage the free flow of meaning and help others leave silence or violence behind, explore their Paths to Action. Start with an attitude of curiosity and patience. This helps restore safety. Then, use four powerful listening skills to retrace the other person’s Path to Action to its origins.
	  
	  1.  Ask. Start by simply expressing interest in the other person’s views.
	  2.  Mirror. Increase safety by respectfully acknowledging the emotions people appear to be feeling.
	  3.  Paraphrase. As others begin to share part of their story, restate what you’ve heard to show not just that you understand, but also that it’s safe for them to share what they’re thinking.
	  4.  Prime. If others continue to hold back, prime. Take your best guess at what they may be thinking and feeling. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsq7r2c5mt4ata7b1ffm7k9v))
