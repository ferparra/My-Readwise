	- THREAD: 15 of the most useful razors and rules I've found.
	  
	  Rules of thumb that simplify decisions.
	- Bezos' Razors: 
	  
	  â€¢ If unsure what action to take, let your 80-year-old self make it. 
	  
	  â€¢ If unsure who to work with, pick the person that has the best chances of breaking you out of a 3rd world prison.
	- Skinner's Law:
	  
	  â€¢ If procrastinating on an item, you only have 2 options: 
	  
	  1. Make the pain of not doing it greater than the pain of doing it.
	  
	  2. Make the pleasure of doing it greater than the pleasure of not doing it.

	- Luck Razor: 
	  
	  â€¢ If stuck with 2 equal options, pick the one that feels like it will produce the most luck later down the line. 
	  
	  I used this razor to go for drinks with a stranger rather than watch Netflix. 
	  
	  In hindsight, it was the highest ROI decision I've ever made.

	- Bragging Razor: 
	  
	  â€¢ If someone brags about their success or happiness, assume itâ€™s half what they claim. 
	  
	  â€¢ If someone downplays their success or happiness, assume itâ€™s double what they claim. 
	  
	  The map is not the terrain.
	- Hofstadterâ€™s Law:Â 
	  
	  â€¢ It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadterâ€™s Law.
	  
	  Every project costs 2x as much and takes 3x as long - even when you factor this into your projections.
	- Elon's Law: 
	  
	  â€¢ If you have a project, combat Hofstader's Law by setting a ridiculously ambitious deadline. 
	  
	  Even if it takes 3x longer than the deadline, you're ahead of everyone else. 
	  
	  Elon Musk missing his super human deadlines is a feature rather than a bug.
	- Naval's Razors: 
	  
	  â€¢ If you have 2 choices to make and it's 50/50, take the path thatâ€™s more painful in the short term.
	  
	  â€¢ If a task is worth less than your ambitious hourly rate - outsource it, automate it or delete it.

	  â€¢ If unsure what action to take - ask what the hero in the movie would do. 
	  
	  â€¢ If you're intensely passionate about something and nobody around you is interested in it - assume the scale of the internet might help you find them.
	- Taleb's Surgeon: 
	  
	  â€¢ If presented with two seemingly equal candidates for a role, pick the one with the least amount of charisma. 
	  
	  The uncharismatic one has got there despite their lack of charisma. 
	  
	  The charismatic one has got there with the aid of their charisma.

	- Checkhov's Gun: 
	  
	  â€¢ When telling a story, if it's non-essential - don't include it. 
	  
	  "If you say in the 1st chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the 2nd or 3rd chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there."
	- Occam's Razor:

	- Walt Disney's Rule: 
	  
	  â€¢ If struggling to think clearly about a subject, draw it out. 
	  
	  Here's Walt Disney's drawing he made in 1957 of the Media Empire he wanted to build. 
	  
	  It's iconic. https://t.co/L2k2h8IJN4
	- Schwarzeneggers' Rule:
	  
	  â€¢ Never need to monetize your artistic pursuits. You won't have to sacrifice your inner joy and vision for a payday.
