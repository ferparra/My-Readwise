	- When I want to solve a problem quickly and cheaply, I think about process design.
	- One of the fundamental challenges of organizational design is sizing teams
	- Managers should support 6-8 engineers and managers-of-managers should support 4-6 managers
	- Consolidate your efforts as a leader. Don’t “peanut butter” the situation by trying to evenly spread yourself out. Spend the most time on the teams that need the most help. Adding new individuals to teams disrupts that team’s gelling process, so have rapid growth periods followed by consolidation/gelling periods
	- Counterintuitively, you can slow a team down by shifting resources to it, because doing so creates new upstream constraints. Slack is a beautiful thing. It gives people and teams time to improve areas and do it with minimal coordination costs
	- You only get values from projects you finish. To make progress, above all else, you must ensure that some of your projects finish
	- Block out large chunks of time each week to focus.
	- Try to get off the “critical path” – don’t be a gatekeeper.
	- Creating an arena for quickly testing hypotheses about how things work, without having to do the underlying work beforehand, is the aspect of systems thinking that I appreciate most
	- Problem discovery – problem selection – solution validation – execution – problem discovery…
	- Work the policy, not the exceptions – consistency is a precondition of fairness so cultures which allow frequent exceptions are not only susceptible to bias, but also inefficient
	- Collect every escalation as a test case for reconsidering your constraints. This approach is powerful because it creates a release valve for folks who are frustrated with edge cases in your current policies
	- Velocity – when folks want you to commit to more work than you believe you can deliver; your goal is to provide a compelling explanation for how your team finishes work.
	- Leadership is matching appropriate action to your current context
